310764_11_ITEM1A_P0_S2	The Company s operating results could be negatively impacted by economic, political or other developments in countries in which the Company does business.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The Company distributes its products throughout the world.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P1_S1	As a result, the Company s future operating results could be negatively impacted by unstable economic, political and social conditions, including but not limited to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, political instability or changes in the interpretation or creation of laws and regulations, including tax laws and regulations, in each of the countries where the Company conducts business, including the United States.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Stricter pricing guidelines for the medical technology industry could have a negative impact on the Company s future operating results.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Initiatives sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation and competitive pricing, are ongoing in markets where the Company does business.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The Company could experience a negative impact on its operating results due to increased pricing pressure in the United States, Europe, Japan and certain other markets.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Governments, hospitals and other third party payers could reduce the amount of approved reimbursements for the Company s products.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Reductions in reimbursement levels or coverage or other cost-containment measures could unfavorably affect the Company s future operating results.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P2_S4	The Company s operating results could be negatively impacted by future product liability claims, unfavorable court decisions, regulatory compliance or legal settlements.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The Company is a defendant in various proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including product liability and other matters.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	outcomes are not predictable with assurance.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	In addition, the Company may incur significant legal expenses regardless of whether it is found to be liable.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	To partially mitigate losses arising from unfavorable outcomes in such matters, the Company purchases third-party insurance coverage subject to certain deductibles and loss limitations.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P4_S3	While the Company believes its current insurance coverage is adequate to mitigate losses arising from such matters, its future operating results may be unfavorably impacted by any settlement payments or losses beyond the amounts of insurance carried.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P4_S4	In addition, such product liability matters may negatively impact the Company s ability to obtain cost-effective third-party insurance coverage in future periods.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Substantially all of the Company s products are subject to regulation by the FDA and other governmental authorities both inside and outside of the United States.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	If the Company were to fail to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements, it may be subject to a range of sanctions including, but not limited to, warning letters, monetary fines, product recalls and the suspension of product manufacturing.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Such sanctions, if implemented, could have a material unfavorable impact on the Company s future operating results.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P5_S3	The Company s inability to maintain adequate working relationships with healthcare professionals could have a negative impact on the Company s future operating results.

310764_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The Company continues to place emphasis on the development of proprietary products and product improvements to complement and expand its existing product lines.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P6_S2	If the Company is unable to maintain these good relationships, its ability to develop, market and sell new and improved products could decrease and future operating results could be unfavorably affected.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P6_S3	The Company s operating results could be negatively impacted by future changes in the allocation of income to each of the income tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The Company operates in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Accordingly, management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Income tax authorities in these jurisdictions regularly perform audits of the Company s income tax filings.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Income tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing, product royalty and foreign branch arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P7_S4	If changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates, such adjustments could have a material unfavorable impact on the Company s income tax expense and net earnings in future periods.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The Company s operating results could be negatively impacted if it is unable to capitalize on research and development spending.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The Company has spent a significant amount of time and resources on research and development projects in order to develop and validate new and innovative products.

310764_11_ITEM1A_P9_S2	However, factors including regulatory delays, safety concerns or patent disputes could delay the introduction or marketing of new products.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Additionally, unanticipated issues may arise in connection with current and future clinical studies that could delay or terminate a product s development prior to regulatory approval.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P9_S4	The Company may experience an unfavorable impact on its operating results if it is unable to capitalize on those efforts by attaining the proper FDA approval or to successfully market new products.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The Company s operating results could be negatively impacted by changes in its excess and obsolete inventory reserves.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The Company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The markets in which the Company operates are highly competitive, and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Such marketplace changes may cause some of the Company s products to become obsolete.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P11_S3	The Company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P11_S4	If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.
310764_11_ITEM1A_P11_S5	The Company s operating results could be negatively impacted if it is unable to capitalize on previous or future acquisitions.

310764_11_ITEM7_P17_S4	On a constant currency basis, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 6% in 2009 as a result of higher shipments of hips, knees, trauma, craniomaxillofacial and spinal implant systems.
310764_11_ITEM7_P17_S5	Hip Implant Systems: Sales of hip implant systems increased 2% in 2009 (5% on a constant currency basis).
310764_11_ITEM7_P17_S6	In the United States, sales growth was driven by Trident hip products, X3 Polyethylene hip products, Accolade cementless hip products and Restoration Modular Hip System revision hip products.
310764_11_ITEM7_P17_S7	Sales growth in several hip systems, including X3 Polyethylene and Accolade cementless hip products in Europe, Canada and the Latin America and Pacific regions and Trident hip products in Japan also contributed to the Company s constant currency sales growth in 2009.
310764_11_ITEM7_P17_S8	Knee Implant Systems: Sales of knee implant systems increased 4% in 2009 (6% on a constant currency basis) due to strong sales growth in the Triathlon Knee System in the United States, Europe, Japan, Canada and the Pacific region and solid sales growth in the Scorpio Knee System in the Latin America region.
310764_11_ITEM7_P17_S9	Trauma Implant Systems: Sales of trauma implant systems increased 5% in 2009 (6% on a constant currency basis) as a result of sales growth in the Gamma 3 Hip Fracture System and the SPS Calcaneal Foot Plating System in the United States, Europe, Canada and the Latin America and Pacific regions as well as sales growth in the Company s VariAx Distal Radius System in Europe, Canada and the Latin America region.
310764_11_ITEM7_P17_S10	Strong sales growth of the HydroSet injectable bone substitute product in the United States, Canada and the Pacific region also contributed to the Company s constant currency sales growth in 2009.
310764_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	Spinal Implant Systems: Sales of spinal implant systems increased 10% in 2009 (11% on a constant currency basis).
310764_11_ITEM7_P18_S1	The increase was driven by strong worldwide sales growth of thoracolumbar implant systems, interbody devices and cervical implants in the United States, Europe and the Latin America and Pacific regions.
310764_11_ITEM7_P18_S2	Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $2,603.4 million for 2009, representing a decrease of 5%.
310764_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	The general economic slowdown in the United States resulted in a significant and rapid contraction in hospital capital budgets that depressed demand for certain MedSurg Equipment products.
310764_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	The severe weakening of the economy caused the Company s hospital customers to reduce capital purchases, which generates the majority of sales within the MedSurg Equipment segment, to a degree not previously experienced in prior recessionary periods.
310764_11_ITEM7_P19_S2	On a constant currency basis, sales of MedSurg Equipment decreased 4% in 2009 as higher shipments of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems were offset by lower shipments of endoscopic and communication systems as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.
310764_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	Surgical Equipment and Surgical Navigation Systems: Sales of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems increased 1% in 2009 (2% on a constant currency basis) due to worldwide sales growth in operating room equipment as well as sales growth in powered surgical products in the United States, Europe, Japan and the Latin America region and sales growth in interventional pain products in the United States, Japan and the Pacific region.
310764_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	Endoscopic and Communications Systems: Sales of endoscopic and communications systems decreased 2% in 2009 (1% decrease on a constant currency basis) due to lower sales of medical video imaging equipment products and image portal products in the United States partially offset by worldwide sales growth in arthroscopy and general surgery products, sales growth in communications products in Japan and the Latin America and Pacific regions and medical video imaging equipment in Europe, Japan and the Latin America and Pacific regions.
310764_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	Patient Handling and Emergency Medical Equipment: Sales of patient handling and emergency medical equipment decreased 22% in 2009 (20% decrease on a constant currency basis) due to lower worldwide sales of hospital bed products and stretchers in the United States, Europe, Canada and the Pacific and Latin America regions, partially offset by sales growth in stretchers in Japan and emergency medical equipment in the United States.
310764_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	Cost of sales represented 32.5% of sales in 2009 compared to 31.7% in 2008.
310764_11_ITEM7_P21_S2	The increase in the cost of sales percentage is primarily due to increased spending for compliance initiatives, higher excess and obsolete inventory costs associated with the Orthopaedic Implants businesses as well as higher unabsorbed costs due to lower production levels.
310764_11_ITEM7_P21_S3	Research, development and engineering expenses represented 5.0% of sales in 2009 compared to 5.5% in 2008.
310764_11_ITEM7_P21_S4	The spending level in 2009 decreased by 9% to $336.2 million due to tight control on discretionary spending as well as the Company s continued focus of certain research and development resources on compliance initiatives.
310764_11_ITEM7_P21_S5	New product introductions in 2009 for the Orthopaedic Implants segment included the Rejuvenate Modular Primary Hip system, the VariAx elbow plating system and the Xia Uniplanar Titanium Spinal System.
310764_11_ITEM7_P21_S6	Within the MedSurg equipment segment, new product introductions in 2009 included the 1288 HD Camera, the Impression non-powered support surface, the Flyte Suit personal protection system and the RemB micro electric system.
310764_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 5% in 2009 and represented 37.3% of sales compared to 39.1% in 2008.
310764_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	In 2009 the Company settled an outstanding patent infringement lawsuit and received $62.5 million pursuant to a confidential settlement agreement.
310764_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	This gain represented a reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses.
310764_11_ITEM7_P23_S2	The remaining decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2009 is due to tight control on discretionary spending that more than offset increased legal settlement costs, net of insurance recoveries, recorded for certain product liability claims.
310764_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	In 2009 the Company recorded $67.0 million ($48.4 million net of income taxes) in restructuring charges related to decisions to terminate certain third-party agent agreements at the Company s EMEA Division, to simplify the organization structure at its Biotech, EMEA, Japan and Canada divisions and to discontinue selling certain products within its Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment segments.
310764_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	In 2008 the Company recorded $34.9 million ($21.7 million net of income taxes) in restructuring charges related to the decisions to simplify the structure of the Company s Japanese distribution business and to substantially reduce development efforts associated with Sightline product technologies acquired in 2006.
310764_11_ITEM7_P24_S2	Interest and marketable securities income, which is included in other income (expense), decreased to $53.9 million in 2009 from $97.7 million in 2008 primarily as a result of lower average yields on the Company s investments.
310764_11_ITEM7_P24_S3	The Company s effective income tax rate on earnings for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 31.8% compared to an effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 of 27.4%.
310764_11_ITEM7_P24_S4	The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2009 reflects the impact of restructuring charges of $48.4 million (net of $18.6 million income tax benefits), the patent litigation gain of $42.9 million (net of $19.6 million income tax expenses) and the impact of the $67.1 million income tax expenses associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings of $787.0 million.
310764_11_ITEM7_P24_S5	The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 reflects the impact of the restructuring charges of $21.7 million (net of $13.2 million income tax benefits).
310764_11_ITEM7_P24_S6	In addition to these factors, the Company s reported effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 are lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of manufacturing in lower income tax jurisdictions.
310764_11_ITEM7_P24_S7	Net earnings decreased 4% in 2009 to $1,107.4 million from $1,147.8 million in 2008.
310764_11_ITEM7_P24_S8	Basic net earnings per share decreased 1% in 2009 to $2.79 from $2.81 in 2008, and diluted net earnings per share decreased to $2.77 in 2009 from $2.78 in 2008.
310764_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	Excluding the impact of the patent litigation gain and the income tax charge associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings recorded in 2009 and the restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and 2008, adjusted net earnings increased 1% in 2009 to $1,180.0 million from $1,169.5 million in 2008.
310764_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	Adjusted basic net earnings per share increased 4% in 2009 to $2.97 from $2.87 in 2008 and adjusted diluted net earnings per share increased 4% in 2009 to $2.95 from $2.83 in 2008.
310764_11_ITEM7_P25_S2	The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are as follows (in millions, except per share amounts): The weighted-average basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures are the same as the weighted-average shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported per share amounts.
310764_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company s working capital at December 31, 2010 increased $1,616.2 million to $6,026.4 million from $4,410.2 million at December 31, 2009.
310764_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	The increase in working capital was primarily due to the issuance of $1,000.0 million of senior unsecured notes in January 2010 as well as increases in accounts receivable, inventories and prepaid expenses, partially offset by the use of cash to fund dividend payments and acquisitions.
310764_11_ITEM7_P26_S2	Accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 56 days at December 31, 2010 and 2009.
310764_11_ITEM7_P26_S3	Days sales in inventory increased by 9 days to 154 days at December 31, 2010 from 145 days at December 31, 2009.
310764_11_ITEM7_P26_S4	Days sales in inventory at December 31, 2010 is higher than the December 31, 2009 level primarily due to higher levels of inventory in support of anticipated 2011 sales growth.
310764_11_ITEM7_P26_S5	The Company generated cash of $1,547.4 million from operations in 2010 compared to $1,460.7 million in 2009.
310764_11_ITEM7_P26_S6	The increase in cash from operations in 2010 is primarily due to increased earnings partially offset by increased inventory levels and higher tax payments.
310764_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	In 2010 the Company used cash of $425.5 million for the repurchase of common stock, $238.3 million for the payment of dividends, $182.1 million for capital expenditures and $265.4 million for acquisitions.
310764_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	On January 15, 2010, the Company sold $500.0 million of the 2015 Notes and $500.0 million of the 2020 Notes.
310764_11_ITEM7_P27_S2	The 2015 Notes bear interest at 3.00% per year and, unless previously redeemed, will mature on January 15, 2015.
310764_11_ITEM7_P27_S3	The 2020 Notes bear interest at 4.375% per year and, unless previously redeemed, will mature on January 15, 2020.
310764_11_ITEM7_P27_S4	The Company received net proceeds of $996.1 million, net of an offering discount of $3.9 million.
310764_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	The 2015 Notes and 2020 Notes carry effective interest rates of 3.02% and 4.46%, respectively.
310764_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	Debt issuance costs of $10.5 million were incurred in connection with the sale of the senior unsecured notes.
310764_11_ITEM7_P28_S2	These costs were capitalized and are amortized to interest expense over the lives of the related senior unsecured notes.
310764_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Company also purchased and sold marketable securities, including exercising its Auction Rate Securities (ARS) Rights agreement, which are classified as available-for-sale investments and trading marketable securities, respectively, in accordance with the provisions of the Investments-Debt and Equity Securities Topic of the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (Codification).
310764_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	The Company had $1,757.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2,622.5 million in current marketable securities at December 31, 2010.
310764_11_ITEM7_P29_S2	The Company had outstanding borrowings totaling $1,021.8 million at December 31, 2010.
310764_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	On January 3, 2011 the Company completed the acquisition of the Neurovascular division from Boston Scientific Corporation.
310764_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	The initial payment of $1.45 billion was funded from the Company s cash position.
310764_11_ITEM7_P30_S2	An addition $50.0 million will be payable upon completion of certain milestones.
310764_11_ITEM7_P30_S3	The Company believes its cash and current marketable securities on hand, anticipated future cash flows from operations and additional borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities will be sufficient to fund future operating capital requirements; future manufacturing facility construction and other capital expenditures; loaner instrumentation for surgical implants in support of new product launches; future debt service requirements; and the payment of dividends.
310764_11_ITEM7_P30_S4	In August 2010 the Company refinanced its credit facility with a new $1,000.0 million Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility due August 2013 (the 2010 Facility).
310764_11_ITEM7_P30_S5	The 2010 Facility replaces the previously outstanding $1,000.0 million Unsecured Credit Facility due in November 2010 (the 2005 Facility).
310764_11_ITEM7_P30_S6	The 2010 Facility includes an increase option permitting the Company to increase the size of the facility up to an additional $500.0 million, a $500.0 million multicurrency sublimit (with no sublimit for euro borrowings), a $100.0 million letter of credit sublimit and other terms, conditions and covenants substantially the same as the 2005 Facility.
310764_11_ITEM7_P30_S7	The 2010 Facility has an annual facility fee ranging from 10 to 45 basis points and bears interest at LIBOR, as defined in the 2010 Facility agreement, plus an applicable margin ranging from 65 to 205 basis points, both of which are dependent on the Company s credit rating.
310764_11_ITEM7_P30_S8	Based on the Company s current credit ratings, the 2010 Facility has an annual facility fee of 12.5 basis points and an interest margin of 87.5 basis points.
310764_11_ITEM7_P30_S9	Should additional funds be required, the Company had $1,027.5 million of additional borrowing capacity available under all of its existing credit facilities as of December 31, 2010, including the 2010 Facility.
310764_11_ITEM7_P30_S10	The Company s additional borrowing capacity, along with the expected expiration period of the commitments, is summarized as follows (in millions): The Company reviews declines in the fair value of its investments classified as available-for-sale for impairment in accordance with the provisions of the Investments-Debt and Equity Securities Topic of the FASB Codification in order to determine whether the decline in fair value is an other-than-temporary impairment.
310764_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	Other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale marketable securities are recorded in earnings.
310764_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	In June 2010 the Company exercised the ARS Rights agreement (ARS Rights) it had entered into in 2008 with UBS Financial Services Inc. (UBS), one of its investment providers, whereby the Company received the right to sell its ARS at par value to UBS at any time during the period from June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012.
310764_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	Pursuant to this agreement, the Company redeemed its entire remaining outstanding ARS investment of $139.9 million par value in the second quarter.
310764_11_ITEM7_P32_S2	Prior to the exercise of the ARS Rights, the Company had applied the fair value option to its ARS Rights pursuant to the provisions of the Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Topic of the FASB Codification.
310764_11_ITEM7_P32_S3	As a result of this election, in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2010, the Company recorded a loss of $17.0 million in other income (expense) to recognize the change in fair value estimate of its ARS Rights.
310764_11_ITEM7_P32_S4	These losses were offset by corresponding gains in the fair value estimate of the related ARS investment.
310764_11_ITEM7_P32_S5	The Company s future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than 1 year, including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business, are summarized as follows (in millions): As further described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2010 the Company s defined benefit pension plans are in an underfunded status of $107.7 million.
310764_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	Due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and the potential for changes in legislation in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the future periods, beyond 2011, in which contributions to fund defined benefit pension plans will be made.
310764_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	As further described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2010, the Company has recorded a liability for uncertain income tax positions of $365.6 million.
310764_11_ITEM7_P33_S2	Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made.
310764_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
310764_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.
310764_11_ITEM7_P34_S2	Estimates are based on historical experience, when available, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
310764_11_ITEM7_P34_S3	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
310764_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	Management believes that, of its significant accounting policies (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable.
310764_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	The Company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends.
310764_11_ITEM7_P36_S2	If actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.
310764_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	The Company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs.
310764_11_ITEM7_P37_S1	The markets in which the Company operates are highly competitive and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis.
310764_11_ITEM7_P37_S2	These marketplace changes may cause some of the Company s products to become obsolete.
310764_11_ITEM7_P37_S3	The Company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends.
310764_11_ITEM7_P37_S4	If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.
310764_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	Income Taxes The Company operates in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States.
310764_11_ITEM7_P38_S1	Accordingly, management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions.
310764_11_ITEM7_P38_S2	Income tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing, product royalty and foreign branch arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates.
310764_11_ITEM7_P38_S3	Because income tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant, the Company records accruals representing management s best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters.
310764_11_ITEM7_P38_S4	To the extent additional information becomes available, such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome.
310764_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	Legal and Other Contingencies The Company is involved in various proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property, and other matters that are more fully described in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time.
310764_11_ITEM7_P39_S2	In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory relief, which could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements.
310764_11_ITEM7_P39_S3	For legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate the Company s future obligations, a liability representing management s best estimate of the probable cost, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded.
310764_11_ITEM7_P39_S4	The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies.
310764_11_ITEM7_P39_S5	If actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.
310764_11_ITEM7_P39_S6	To partially mitigate losses arising from unfavorable outcomes in such matters, the Company purchases third-party insurance coverage subject to certain deductibles and loss limitations.
310764_11_ITEM7_P39_S7	Future operating results may be unfavorably impacted by any settlement payments or losses beyond the amounts of insurance carried.
310764_11_ITEM7_P39_S8	In addition, such matters may negatively impact the Company s ability to obtain cost-effective third-party insurance coverage in future periods.
310764_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In 2010 the Company adopted the provisions of the Improvement to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities Topic of the FASB Codification.
310764_11_ITEM7_P40_S1	The topic requires a qualitative approach to identifying a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity (VIE) and requires ongoing assessment of whether an entity is a VIE and whether an interest in a VIE makes the holder the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
310764_11_ITEM7_P40_S2	There was no impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of the adoption of this topic of the FASB Codification.
310764_11_ITEM7_P40_S3	In 2010 the Company adopted the provisions of the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic Improving Disclosures About Fair Value Measurements of the FASB Codification .
310764_11_ITEM7_P40_S4	This topic requires companies to make new disclosures about recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements, including significant transfers into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, and information on purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements.
310764_11_ITEM7_P40_S5	The enhanced disclosures about recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements are included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_11_ITEM7_P40_S6	In 2009 the Company adopted the provisions of the Business Combinations Topic of the FASB Codification .
310764_11_ITEM7_P40_S7	This topic significantly changes the principles and requirements for how an acquisition is recognized and measured in financial statements, including the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
310764_11_ITEM7_P40_S8	This topic also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring goodwill acquired in a business combination and requires disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination.
310764_11_ITEM7_P40_S9	The additional disclosure requirements regarding the Business Combinations Topic of the FASB Codification are included in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_11_ITEM7_P40_S10	Other Matters The Company distributes its products throughout the world.
310764_11_ITEM7_P40_S11	As a result, the Company s financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak economic conditions or changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
310764_11_ITEM7_P40_S12	The Company s operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the U.S. dollar, European currencies, in particular the euro and the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar.
310764_11_ITEM7_P40_S13	When the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases.
310764_11_ITEM7_P40_S14	When the U.S. dollar strengthens, the opposite situation occurs.
310764_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	The Company develops and manufactures its products in the United States, China, France, Germany, Ireland, Puerto Rico and Switzerland and incurs costs in the applicable local currencies.
310764_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	This worldwide deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the Company s cost of sales.
310764_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	The Company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk to the Company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates.
310764_11_ITEM7_P42_S1	These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products as well as, in 2010, nonfunctional cash balances associated with the anticipated acquisition of the Neurovascular division from Boston Scientific and, in 2009, intercompany loans associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings.
310764_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies.
310764_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	All forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period, with resulting gains (losses) included in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
310764_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	At December 31, 2010, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $1,011.9 million and sell $366.9 million of various currencies (principally U.S. dollars and euros) with maturities ranging from 7 to 99 days.
310764_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	contracts to purchase $2,041.1 million and sell $280.5 million of various currencies (principally U.S. dollars and euros) with maturities ranging from 4 to 106 days.
310764_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points.
310764_11_ITEM7_P46_S1	A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would change the December 31, 2010 fair value by approximately $63.9 million.
310764_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties.
310764_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	The Company has certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged.
310764_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	These investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
310764_11_ITEM7_P48_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2010, the strengthening of U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies decreased the value of these investments in net assets and the related foreign currency translation adjustment loss in shareholders equity by $81.0 million to $196.5 million from $277.5 million at December 31, 2009.
310764_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	In the third quarter of 2010, the Company received separate subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice related to (i) the sales, marketing and regulatory matters related to the Stryker PainPump and (ii) sales, marketing and regulatory matters related to the OtisKnee device.
310764_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	The Company is in the process of responding to these subpoenas.
310764_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	In March 2010 a shareholder s derivative action complaint against certain current and former Directors and Officers of the Company was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan Southern Division.
310764_11_ITEM7_P50_S1	This lawsuit was brought by the Westchester Putnam Counties Heavy and Highway Laborers Local 60 Benefit Funds and Laborers Local 235 Benefit Funds.
310764_11_ITEM7_P50_S2	The complaint alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duties and gross mismanagement in connection with certain product recalls, FDA warning letters, government investigations relating to physician compensation and the criminal proceeding brought against the Company s Biotech division.
310764_11_ITEM7_P50_S3	The case has been stayed while a Special Committee of the Board of Directors evaluates the claims.
310764_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	In January 2010 a purported class action lawsuit against the Company was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of those who purchased the Company s common stock between January 25, 2007 and November 13, 2008, inclusive.
310764_11_ITEM7_P51_S1	The lawsuit seeks remedies under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
310764_11_ITEM7_P51_S2	In May 2010 the lawsuit was transferred to the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan Southern Division.
310764_11_ITEM7_P51_S3	The Company intends to defend itself vigorously.
310764_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	In 2009 a federal grand jury in the District of Massachusetts returned an indictment charging Stryker Biotech LLC and certain current and former employees of Stryker Biotech with wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the FDA, distribution of a misbranded device and false statements to the FDA.
310764_11_ITEM7_P52_S1	The Company still hopes to be able to reach a fair and just resolution of this matter.
310764_11_ITEM7_P52_S2	The ultimate resolution of this matter is not reasonably estimable at this time, however, a conviction on the charges described above could result in significant monetary fines.
310764_11_ITEM7_P52_S3	Because Stryker Biotech is not presently involved in the sale of health care products and services (see additional information in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), any conviction on these charges resulting in exclusion from participating in federal and state health care programs would not be expected to have a material effect on Stryker Biotech s present business operations.
310764_11_ITEM7_P52_S4	Certain former Stryker Biotech employees have pled guilty to charges in connection with this matter.
310764_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	In 2009 the Company received a warning letter from the FDA related to compliance issues for one of its craniomaxillofacial (CMF) implant products that was previously sold through its CMF distribution facility in Portage, Michigan.
310764_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	In 2007 the Company received two warning letters from the FDA regarding compliance with certain quality system specifications at its reconstructive implant manufacturing facilities: one letter for its facility in Cork, Ireland and another for its facility in Mahwah, New Jersey.
310764_11_ITEM7_P53_S2	In March 2010 the FDA informed the Company that the warning letter related to its Mahwah manufacturing facility had been resolved following a re-inspection in 2009 and additional corrective actions.
310764_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	warning letters related to its Cork, Ireland and CMF facilities had been resolved following FDA re-inspection of the Cork, Ireland facility and additional corrective actions at both the Cork and CMF facilities.
310764_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	In 2007 the Company announced that it reached a resolution with the U.S. Attorney s office for the District of New Jersey in connection with an investigation relating to any and all consulting contracts, professional service agreements, or remuneration agreements between Stryker Corporation and any orthopedic surgeon, orthopedic surgeon in training, or medical school graduate using or considering the surgical use of hip or knee joint replacement/reconstruction products manufactured or sold by Stryker Corporation.
310764_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	The resolution was in the form of a non-prosecution agreement, which included oversight by a federal monitor, for an 18-month period that ended on March 27, 2009.
310764_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	Subsequent to entering into the non-prosecution agreement, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS) issued a civil subpoena to the Company in seeking to determine whether the Company violated various laws by paying consulting fees and providing other things of value to orthopedic surgeons and healthcare and educational institutions as inducements to use Stryker s orthopedic medical devices in procedures paid for in whole or in part by Medicare.
310764_11_ITEM7_P56_S1	The investigation is ongoing and the Company has produced numerous documents and other materials to HHS in response to the subpoena.
310764_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	In 2007 the Company disclosed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made an informal inquiry of the Company regarding possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in connection with the sale of medical devices in certain foreign countries.
310764_11_ITEM7_P57_S1	Subsequently, in 2008, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice, Criminal Division, requesting certain documents for the period since January 1, 2000 in connection with the SEC inquiry.
310764_11_ITEM7_P57_S2	The Company is fully cooperating with the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC regarding these matters.

310764_11_ITEM8_P41_S0	NOTE 2 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company s financial instruments consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, other investments, accounts payable, debt and foreign currency exchange contracts.
310764_11_ITEM8_P41_S1	The Company s estimates of fair value for financial instruments approximate their carrying amounts as of December 31, 2010.
310764_11_ITEM8_P42_S0	Pursuant to the requirements of the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB Codification , the Company s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
310764_11_ITEM8_P43_S0	Financial instruments with unadjusted, quoted prices listed on active market exchanges.
310764_11_ITEM8_P44_S0	Financial instruments lacking unadjusted, quoted prices from active market exchanges, including over-the-counter traded financial instruments.
310764_11_ITEM8_P44_S1	The prices for the financial instruments are determined using prices for recently traded financial instruments with similar underlying terms as well as directly or indirectly observable inputs, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.
310764_11_ITEM8_P45_S0	Financial instruments that are not actively traded on a market exchange.
310764_11_ITEM8_P46_S0	This category includes situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the financial instrument.
310764_11_ITEM8_P46_S1	The prices are determined using significant unobservable inputs or valuation techniques.
310764_11_ITEM8_P47_S0	The following describes the methods the Company uses to estimate the fair value of the Company s financial assets and liabilities: Cash and cash equivalents : The Company considers the carrying values of these financial instruments to approximate fair value for these financial instruments because of the short period of time between origination of the instruments and their expected realization.
310764_11_ITEM8_P48_S0	Available-for-sale marketable securities : The Company s Level 2 available-for-sale marketable securities primarily include U.S. agency debt securities, foreign government debt securities, asset backed debt securities, corporate debt securities and certificates of deposit.
310764_11_ITEM8_P48_S1	The Company s Level 2 available-for-sale marketable securities values are determined using prices for recently traded financial instruments with similar underlying terms as well as directly or indirectly observable inputs, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.
310764_11_ITEM8_P48_S2	The Company s Level 3 available-for-sale marketable securities include corporate and foreign government debt securities.
310764_11_ITEM8_P49_S0	The Company s Level 3 available-for-sale marketable securities valuations are based on the income approach, specifically, discounted cash flow analyses that utilize significant inputs based on the Company s estimates and assumptions.
310764_11_ITEM8_P49_S1	Using this approach, estimates for timing and amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the securities were used and the expected future cash flows were calculated over the expected life of each security and were discounted to a single present value using an estimated market required rate of return.
310764_11_ITEM8_P50_S0	Trading marketable securities : The Company s Level 1 trading marketable securities consist of mutual funds and are valued using a market approach based on quoted prices for the specific mutual fund from transactions in active exchange markets.
310764_11_ITEM8_P50_S1	Auction Rate Securities Rights : In June 2010 the Company exercised the ARS Rights agreement (ARS Rights) it had entered into in 2008 with UBS Financial Services Inc. (UBS), one of its investment providers, whereby the Company received the right to sell its ARS at par value to UBS at any time during the period from June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012.
310764_11_ITEM8_P50_S2	Pursuant to this agreement, the Company redeemed its entire remaining outstanding ARS investment of $139.9 million par value.
310764_11_ITEM8_P50_S3	Prior to the exercise of the ARS Rights, the Company had applied the fair value option to its ARS Rights pursuant to the provisions of the Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Topic of the FASB Codification.
310764_11_ITEM8_P50_S4	As a result of this election, in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2010, the Company recorded a loss of $17.0 million in other income (expense) to recognize the change in fair value estimate of its ARS Rights.
310764_11_ITEM8_P50_S5	The loss was offset by corresponding gains in the fair value estimate of the related ARS investment.
310764_11_ITEM8_P50_S6	In the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2009 the Company recorded a loss of $11.0 million in other income (expense) to recognize the change in fair value estimate of its ARS Rights.
310764_11_ITEM8_P50_S7	This loss was offset by a corresponding gain in the fair value estimate of the related trading marketable securities.
310764_11_ITEM8_P51_S0	Foreign currency exchange contracts : The Company values foreign currency exchange contracts using a market approach based on foreign currency exchange rates obtained from active markets.
310764_11_ITEM8_P51_S1	The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points.
310764_11_ITEM8_P51_S2	At December 31, 2010, the fair value carrying amount of the Company s forward currency exchange contracts assets and liabilities were $2.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively.

310764_11_ITEM8_P54_S2	While many of these investments have been downgraded by rating agencies since their initial purchase, less than 1% of the Company s investments in corporate and asset-backed debt securities had a credit quality rating of less than single A (per Standard Poor s or Fitch).
310764_11_ITEM8_P54_S3	Because the Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider those investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2010.
310764_11_ITEM8_P54_S4	The unrealized losses on the Company s investments in foreign government debt securities were also caused by interest rate increases.

310764_11_ITEM8_P58_S1	These currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products as well as, in 2009, intercompany loans associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings.
310764_11_ITEM8_P59_S0	The duration of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the anticipated period the intercompany receivables and payables remain outstanding.
310764_11_ITEM8_P59_S1	The Company does not designate these contracts as hedges; therefore, all forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period, with resulting gains and losses included in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as an offset to the gains and losses recognized on the intercompany receivables and payables.

310764_11_ITEM8_P124_S2	The supply agreement is contingent, among other things, on the acquirer s ability to provide products that meet quality standards, and may be terminated by Stryker if such a material breach occurs.

310764_11_ITEM8_P127_S1	The Company is in the process of responding to these subpoenas.
310764_11_ITEM8_P128_S0	In March 2010 a shareholder s derivative action complaint against certain current and former Directors and Officers of the Company was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan Southern Division.

310764_11_ITEM8_P128_S2	The complaint alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duties and gross mismanagement in connection with certain product recalls, FDA warning letters, government investigations relating to physician compensation and the criminal proceeding brought against the Company s Biotech division.

310764_11_ITEM8_P130_S2	The ultimate resolution of this matter is not reasonably estimable at this time, however, a conviction on the charges described above could result in significant monetary fines.
310764_11_ITEM8_P130_S3	Because Stryker Biotech is not presently involved in the sale of health care products or services (see additional information in Note 18), any conviction on these charges resulting in exclusion from participating in federal and state health care programs would not be expected to have a material effect on Stryker Biotech s present business operations.
310764_11_ITEM8_P130_S4	Certain former Stryker Biotech employees have pled guilty to charges in connection with this matter.
310764_11_ITEM8_P131_S0	In 2007 the Company received two warning letters from the FDA regarding compliance with certain quality system specifications at its reconstructive implant manufacturing facilities: one letter for its facility in Cork, Ireland and another for its facility in Mahwah, New Jersey.

310764_11_ITEM8_P133_S1	The investigation is ongoing and the Company has produced numerous documents and other materials to HHS in response to the subpoena.

310764_11_ITEM8_P134_S1	Subsequently, in 2008, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice, Criminal Division, requesting certain documents for the period since January 1, 2000 in connection with the SEC inquiry.
310764_11_ITEM8_P134_S2	The Company is fully cooperating with the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC regarding these matters.
310764_11_ITEM8_P135_S0	Pursuant to certain of the Company s credit and lease agreements, the Company has provided financial guarantees to third parties in the form of indemnification provisions.
310764_11_ITEM8_P135_S1	These provisions indemnify the third parties for costs, including but not limited to adverse judgments in lawsuits and the imposition of additional income taxes due to either a change in the tax law or an adverse interpretation of the tax law.
310764_11_ITEM8_P135_S2	The terms of the guarantees are equal to the terms of the related credit or lease agreements.
310764_11_ITEM8_P135_S3	The Company is not able to calculate the maximum potential amount of future payments it could be required to make under these guarantees, as any potential payment is dependent on the occurrence of future unknown events (e.g., changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws).
310764_11_ITEM8_P136_S0	NOTE 18 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS On February 1, 2011, the Company completed its previously announced sale of its OP-1 product family for use in orthopaedic bone applications and its manufacturing facility based in West Lebanon, NH for total consideration of $60.0 million.
310764_11_ITEM8_P137_S0	On January 3, 2011, the Company completed the previously announced acquisition of assets of the Neurovascular division of Boston Scientific Corporation (Neurovascular) in an all cash transaction for $1.45 billion, with an additional $50.0 million payment to be made upon completion of certain milestones.
310764_11_ITEM8_P137_S1	The acquisition of Neurovascular is expected to substantially enhance the Company s presence in the neurovascular market, allowing it to offer a comprehensive portfolio of products in both neurosurgical and neurovascular devices.
310764_11_ITEM8_P137_S2	The effect of the Neurovascular acquisition will be included in the Company s consolidated results of operations prospectively from the date of acquisition.
310764_11_ITEM8_P138_S0	The Company has evaluated subsequent events after December 31, 2010 and concluded that no material transactions occurred subsequent to that date that provided additional evidence about conditions that existed at or after December 31, 2010 that require adjustment to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_11_ITEM8_P139_S0	The price quotations reported above were supplied by the New York Stock Exchange.
310764_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures An evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2010 was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (the Certifying Officers).
310764_11_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on that evaluation, the Certifying Officers concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

310764_11_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Based on that assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2010, the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective.
310764_11_ITEM9A_P1_S5	Stryker Corporation s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
310764_11_ITEM9A_P1_S6	This report appears on the following page.
310764_11_ITEM9A_P1_S7	Other Matters The Company is in the process of implementing new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems at certain of its divisions including its Europe division.
310764_11_ITEM9A_P1_S8	An ERP system is a fully-integrated set of programs and databases that incorporate order processing, production planning and scheduling, purchasing, accounts receivable and inventory management and accounting.
310764_11_ITEM9A_P1_S9	In connection with this ERP system implementation, the Company will update its internal controls over financial reporting, as necessary, to accommodate modifications to its business processes and accounting procedures.
310764_11_ITEM9A_P1_S10	The Company does not believe that this ERP system implementation will have an adverse effect on the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
310764_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Stryker Corporation : We have audited Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
310764_11_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
310764_11_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
310764_11_ITEM9A_P2_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
310764_11_ITEM9A_P2_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
310764_11_ITEM9A_P2_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
310764_11_ITEM9A_P2_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
310764_11_ITEM9A_P3_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
310764_11_ITEM9A_P3_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
310764_11_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
310764_11_ITEM9A_P3_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
310764_11_ITEM9A_P3_S4	In our opinion, Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the COSO criteria.
310764_11_ITEM9A_P3_S5	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 of Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries, and our report dated February 18, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

310764_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	Stryker was incorporated in Michigan in 1946 as the successor company to a business founded in 1941 by Dr. Homer H. Stryker, a prominent orthopaedic surgeon and the inventor of several orthopaedic products.
310764_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	In the United States, most of our products are marketed directly to doctors, hospitals and other health-care facilities.
310764_12_ITEM1_P4_S1	Internationally, our products are sold in over 100 countries through Company-owned sales subsidiaries and branches as well as third-party dealers and distributors.
310764_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	In 2011 we began segregating our reporting into three reportable business segments: Reconstructive, MedSurg, and Neurotechnology and Spine.
310764_12_ITEM1_P5_S1	Financial information regarding our reportable business segments and certain geographic information is included under Results of Operations in Item 7 of this report and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.
310764_12_ITEM1_P5_S2	We have restated prior period segment information to conform to the current presentation.

310764_12_ITEM1_P6_S1	Many of our technologically advanced reconstructive implants are suited to minimally invasive surgery procedures that are intended to reduce soft-tissue damage and pain while hastening return to function.
310764_12_ITEM1_P6_S2	We support surgeons with technology, procedural development and specialized instrumentation as they develop new surgical techniques.
310764_12_ITEM1_P6_S3	In 2011 we received 510(k) approval to market our ShapeMatch Cutting Guides for use with our Triathlon Total Knee System.
310764_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	ShapeMatch technology utilizes proprietary 3D imaging software to develop a customized preoperative surgical plan for each patient and is available only for use with the Triathlon system.
310764_12_ITEM1_P7_S1	In 2011 we acquired Memometal Technologies, which develops, manufactures and markets products for extremity (hand and foot) indications that enhance the offerings in our trauma product line.

310764_12_ITEM1_P14_S1	Substantially all products we manufacture are stocked in inventory, while certain MedSurg products are assembled to order.
310764_12_ITEM1_P14_S2	The dollar amount of backlog orders at any given time is not considered to be significant.
310764_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	Patents and Trademarks Patents and trademarks are significant to our business to the extent that a product or an attribute of a product represents a unique design or process.
310764_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	Patent protection of such products restricts competitors from duplicating these unique designs and features.
310764_12_ITEM1_P15_S2	We seek to obtain patent protection on our products whenever appropriate for protecting our competitive advantage.
310764_12_ITEM1_P15_S3	As of December 31, 2011, we own approximately 1,456 United States patents and 2,579 international patents.
310764_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	Seasonality Our business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of reconstructive implant surgeries is generally lower during the summer months.
310764_12_ITEM1_P16_S1	In all of our product lines, we compete with local and global companies located throughout the world.
310764_12_ITEM1_P16_S2	Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved.
310764_12_ITEM1_P16_S3	The development of new and innovative products is important to our success in all areas of our business and competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant.
310764_12_ITEM1_P16_S4	The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and in maintaining sales forces.
310764_12_ITEM1_P16_S5	The principal factors that we believe differentiate us in the highly competitive product categories in which we operate and enable us to compete effectively include our commitment to innovation and quality, service and reputation.
310764_12_ITEM1_P16_S6	We believe that our competitive position in the future will depend to a large degree on our ability to develop new products and make improvements to existing products.
310764_12_ITEM1_P16_S7	Product Development Most of our products and product improvements, with the exception of our neurotechnology products, have been developed internally at research facilities located in manufacturing locations in the United States, Ireland, Puerto Rico, Germany, Switzerland and France.
310764_12_ITEM1_P16_S8	We also invest through acquisitions in technologies developed by third parties that have the potential to expand the markets in which we operate.
310764_12_ITEM1_P16_S9	We maintain close working relationships with physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist us in product development efforts.

310764_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	Regulation Most of our businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation.
310764_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	In the United States, the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990, and the regulations issued or proposed thereunder, provide for regulation by the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices, including most of our products.
310764_12_ITEM1_P20_S1	Most of our new products fall into FDA classifications that require notification of and review by the FDA before marketing, submitted as a 510(k).
310764_12_ITEM1_P20_S2	Certain of our products require extensive clinical testing, consisting of safety and efficacy studies, followed by pre-market approval applications for specific surgical indications.
310764_12_ITEM1_P20_S3	The FDA's Quality System regulations set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the FDA.
310764_12_ITEM1_P20_S4	There are also certain requirements of state, local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the manufacturing and marketing of our products.
310764_12_ITEM1_P20_S5	We have previously been subject to warning letters issued by the FDA but all warning letters have been resolved as of May 10, 2010 and none are currently outstanding.
310764_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	The member states of the European Union (EU) have adopted the European Medical Device Directives that form a single set of medical device regulations for all EU member countries.
310764_12_ITEM1_P21_S1	These regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member countries to obtain CE Marking for their products.
310764_12_ITEM1_P21_S2	We have authorization to apply the CE Marking to substantially all of our products.
310764_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	Initiatives sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare expenses generally and hospital costs in particular, including price regulation and competitive pricing, are ongoing in markets where we do business.
310764_12_ITEM1_P22_S1	It is not possible to predict at this time the long-term impact of such cost-containment measures on our future business.
310764_12_ITEM1_P22_S2	In addition, business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the United States, by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.
310764_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	Employees At December 31, 2011, we had approximately 21,241 employees worldwide.
310764_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	Certain international employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
310764_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	We believe that we maintain positive relationships with our employees worldwide.
310764_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	Executive Officers of the Registrant Information regarding our executive officers appears under the caption "Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance" in Item 10 of this Report.

310764_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	This report contains statements referring to us that are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These statements, which are intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Reform Act, are based on current projections about operations, industry conditions, financial condition and liquidity.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Words that identify forward-looking statements include words such as may, could, will, should, possible, plan, predict, forecast, potential, anticipate, estimate, expect, project, intend, believe, may impact, on track, and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance, a merger, or our businesses.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Those statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Therefore, actual results could differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forward-looking statements include those risks discussed below.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations, We may be unable to effectively develop and market products against those of our competitors in a highly competitive industry.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Competitive factors include price, customer service, technology, innovation, quality, reputation and reliability.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Our competition may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us or may be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees and strategic partners.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Given these factors, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue our level of success in the industry.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Competition in research, involving development and the improvement of new and existing products, is particularly significant and results from time to time in product obsolescence.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Such marketplace changes may cause some of our products to become obsolete.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P4_S3	If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, a higher level of inventory write-downs may result.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Dependence on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to such rights may result in our payment of significant monetary damages or impact offerings in our product portfolios.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our long-term success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	If we fail to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property protection, we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies or may lose access to technologies critical to our products.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Also, our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents, and issued patents are subject to claims concerning priority, scope and other issues.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Intellectual property litigation and infringement claims could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling certain of our products.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The medical device industry is characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation and, from time to time, we are the subject of claims by third parties of potential infringement or misappropriation.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Regardless of outcome, such claims are expensive to defend and divert the time and effort of our management and operating personnel from other business issues.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P7_S2	A successful claim or claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments or negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products in the affected category and could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to the manufacturing, labeling and marketing of our products.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Substantially all of our products are subject to regulation by the FDA and other governmental authorities both inside and outside of the United States.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis, if at all.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P8_S3	In addition, if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to a range of sanctions including warning letters, monetary fines, product recalls and the suspension of product manufacturing, and criminal prosecution.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Healthcare changes in the United States and other countries resulting in pricing pressures could have a negative impact on our future operating results.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Initiatives sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation and competitive pricing, are ongoing in markets where we do business.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Pricing pressure has also increased in our markets due to continued consolidation among health care providers, trends toward managed care, the shift towards governments becoming the primary payers of health care expenses, and government laws and regulations relating to reimbursement and pricing generally.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Reductions in reimbursement levels or coverage or other cost-containment measures could unfavorably affect our future operating results.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The impact of United States healthcare reform legislation on us remains uncertain.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	In 2010 federal legislation to reform the United States healthcare system was enacted into law.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The legislation is far-reaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage, improve quality and reduce costs over time.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We expect the new law will have a significant impact upon various aspects of our business operations.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P11_S3	However, it is unclear how the new law will impact patient access to new technologies or reimbursement rates under the Medicare program.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P11_S4	In addition, the new law imposes a 2.3 percent excise tax on medical devices scheduled to be implemented in 2013 that will apply to United States sales of a majority of our medical device products.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Many of the details of the new law will be included in new and revised regulations, which have not yet been promulgated, and require additional guidance and specificity to be provided by the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Labor and Department of the Treasury.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We may be adversely affected by product liability claims, unfavorable court decisions or legal settlements.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We are defendants in various proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including product liability and other matters.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P12_S3	These matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P12_S4	In addition, we may incur significant legal expenses regardless of whether we are found to be liable.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P12_S5	To partially mitigate losses arising from unfavorable outcomes in such matters, we purchase third-party insurance coverage subject to certain retentions, deductibles and loss limitations.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P12_S6	While we believe our current insurance coverage is adequate to mitigate losses arising from such matters, we may be adversely impacted by any settlement payments or losses beyond the amounts of insurance carried or for which coverage is otherwise not available.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P12_S7	In addition, even if covered by insurance, such losses may negatively impact our ability to obtain third-party insurance coverage in future periods on a cost-effective basis or at all.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P12_S8	We may be unable to maintain adequate working relationships with healthcare professionals.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P12_S9	We seek to maintain close working relationships with respected physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist in product research and development.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P12_S10	We rely on these professionals to assist us in the development of proprietary products and product improvements to complement and expand our existing product lines.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P12_S11	If we are unable to maintain these relationships, our ability to develop, market and sell new and improved products could decrease and future operating results could be unfavorably affected.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P12_S12	We are subject to additional risks associated with our extensive international operations.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P12_S13	We develop, manufacture and distribute our products throughout the world.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P12_S14	Our international operations are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of additional risks and potential costs, including changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs, unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements, differing local product preferences and product requirements, diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the United States, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, extraterritorial effects of United States laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations, and political and economic instability.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P12_S15	Exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross border transactions and translation of local currency results into United States dollars could have a significant impact on the reported results of our operations, which are presented in United States dollars .
310764_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Cross border transactions, both with external parties and intercompany relationships, result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Accordingly, significant changes in currency exchange rates could negatively affect our results of operations.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	In addition, our sales are translated into United States dollars for reporting purposes.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P13_S3	The strengthening or weakening of the United States dollar could result in favorable or unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into United States dollars.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Our operating results could be negatively impacted by future changes in the allocation of income to each of the income tax jurisdictions in which we operate.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P13_S5	We operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P13_S6	Accordingly, our management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P13_S7	Income tax authorities in these jurisdictions regularly perform audits of our income tax filings.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P13_S8	Income tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing, product royalty and foreign branch arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P13_S9	If changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates, such adjustments could have a material unfavorable impact on our income tax expense and net earnings.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We may be unable to capitalize on previous or future acquisitions.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	In addition to internally developed products, we rely upon investment in new technologies through acquisitions.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Investments in medical technology are inherently risky, and we cannot guarantee that any acquisition will be successful or will not have a material unfavorable impact on us.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P14_S3	These risks include the activities required by us to integrate new businesses, which may result in the need to allocate more resources to integration and product development activities than originally anticipated, diversion of management's time, which could adversely affect management's ability to focus on other projects, the inability to realize the expected benefits, savings or synergies from the acquisition, the loss of key personnel of the acquired company, and exposure to unexpected liabilities of the acquired company.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P14_S4	In addition, we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so, which may result in unexpected impairment charges.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Failure of a key information technology system, process or site could have a material adverse impact on our business.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We rely extensively on information technology systems to conduct business.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	These systems include, but are not limited to, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping products to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, providing data security and other processes necessary to manage our business.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P15_S2	If our systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively compensate on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations, which may adversely impact our business, cash flows, financial conditions or results of operations.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P15_S3	We may be unable to attract and retain key employees .
310764_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	development, marketing and selling of new and existing products.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P16_S1	If we are unable to recruit, hire, develop and retain a talented, competitive work force, we may not be able to meet our strategic business objectives.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Macroeconomic developments, such as the recent recessions in Europe and the debt crisis in certain countries in the European Union, could negatively affect our ability to conduct business in those geographies.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P16_S3	The continuing debt crisis in certain European countries could cause the value of the euro to deteriorate, reducing the purchasing power of our European customers.
310764_12_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers and customers, including distributors, could result in product delays and inventory issues; risks to accounts receivable could also include delays in collection and greater bad debt expense.
310764_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	The following are our principal manufacturing locations as of December 31, 2011:
310764_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	In addition, we maintain corporate, administrative and sales offices and warehousing and distribution facilities in multiple countries.
310764_12_ITEM2_P1_S1	We believe that our properties are suitable and adequate for the manufacture and distribution of our products.
310764_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are involved in various proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property, and other matters that are more fully described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report; this information is incorporated herein by reference.
310764_12_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SYK.
310764_12_ITEM5_P0_S1	Quarterly stock price and dividend information for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were as follows:
310764_12_ITEM5_P1_S0	Our Board of Directors considers payment of cash dividends at each of its quarterly meetings.
310764_12_ITEM5_P1_S1	On January 31, 2012, there were 4,487 shareholders of record of our common stock.
310764_12_ITEM5_P1_S2	In December 2010 and 2009 we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized us to purchase up to $500 and $750, respectively, of our common stock from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.
310764_12_ITEM5_P1_S3	During 2011 pursuant to these authorizations we repurchased 11.8 million shares of our common stock in the open market at a total cost of $622, of which 1.8 million shares were repurchased in the fourth quarter at a cost of $83 as follows:
310764_12_ITEM5_P2_S0	In December 2011 we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized us to purchase an additional $500 of our common stock from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.
310764_12_ITEM5_P2_S1	We did not make any repurchases pursuant to this program in 2011.
310764_12_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following graph compares our total returns (including reinvestments of dividends) against the Standard Poor s (S P) 500 Composite Stock Price Index and the S P Health Care (Medical Products and Supplies) Index.
310764_12_ITEM5_P3_S1	The graph assumes $100 (not in millions) invested on December 31, 2006 in our Common Stock and each of the indices.
310764_12_ITEM5_P4_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_12_ITEM6_P0_S0	Selected financial data for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 2011 is as follows:
310764_12_ITEM6_P1_S0	(a) Includes restructuring charges, asset impairments, and purchased in-process research and development charges.
310764_12_ITEM6_P2_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under GAAP with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including percentage sales growth in constant currency, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share.
310764_12_ITEM7_P0_S1	We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance.
310764_12_ITEM7_P0_S2	Management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency, adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses.
310764_12_ITEM7_P0_S3	Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments, for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these non-GAAP financial measures.
310764_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales.
310764_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	Percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates.
310764_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	To measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings.
310764_12_ITEM7_P2_S1	Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names.
310764_12_ITEM7_P2_S2	These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth, net earnings and diluted net earnings per share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
310764_12_ITEM7_P2_S3	These non-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures at the end of the discussion of Results of Operations below, provide a more complete understanding of our business.
310764_12_ITEM7_P2_S4	We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.
310764_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	ABOUT STRYKER Stryker is one of the world's leading medical technology companies, with 2011 revenues of $8,307 and net earnings of $1,345.
310764_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	We are dedicated to helping healthcare professionals perform their jobs more efficiently while enhancing patient care.
310764_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	We offer a diverse array of innovative medical technologies, including reconstructive, medical and surgical, and neurotechnology and spine products, to help people lead more active and more satisfying lives.
310764_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	In 2011 we began segregating our reporting into three reportable business segments: Reconstructive, MedSurg, and Neurotechnology and Spine.
310764_12_ITEM7_P4_S3	See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
310764_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	Recent Business Developments In January 2012 we reached a settlement regarding a 2009 indictment charging Stryker Biotech LLC and certain then-current employees and a former employee of Stryker Biotech with wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the FDA, distribution of a misbranded device and false statements to the FDA.
310764_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	We reached a settlement with the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts, under which Stryker pled to one misdemeanor charge and paid a non-tax deductible fine of $15.
310764_12_ITEM7_P5_S2	As a result of this resolution, the Department of Justice dismissed all thirteen felony charges against Stryker Biotech contained in the 2009 federal grand jury indictment.
310764_12_ITEM7_P5_S3	All of the charges against the then-current and former employees of Stryker Biotech have also been dismissed.
310764_12_ITEM7_P5_S4	The settlement represented a recognized subsequent event and accordingly was recorded in our fourth quarter 2011 results.
310764_12_ITEM7_P5_S5	In 2011 we recorded $38 in severance and related costs in connection with focused reductions of our global workforce and other restructuring activities that are expected to reduce our global workforce by approximately 5% by the end of 2012.
310764_12_ITEM7_P5_S6	The targeted reductions and other restructuring activities are being initiated to provide efficiencies and realign resources in advance of the new Medical Device Excise Tax scheduled to begin in 2013, as well as to allow for continued investment in strategic areas and drive growth.
310764_12_ITEM7_P5_S7	In addition, we recorded $25 in intangible asset impairments and $13 in contractual and other obligations, as certain of our restructuring actions resulted in the discontinued use of specific assets and the exit of certain lease and other commitments.
310764_12_ITEM7_P5_S8	In 2011 we recorded an income tax benefit related to a favorable settlement with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regarding its proposed adjustment to our previously filed 2003 through 2007 income tax returns related to income tax positions we had taken with respect to our cost sharing arrangements with two wholly owned entities operating in Ireland, and we recorded charges for other uncertain tax positions related to the outcome of the IRS settlements.
310764_12_ITEM7_P5_S9	The net benefit of these adjustments for uncertain tax positions was $99 (net of tax).
310764_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	In October 2011 we acquired Concentric Medical, Inc. (Concentric), which manufactures and markets minimally invasive products for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, in an all cash transaction for $135.
310764_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	The acquisition of Concentric enhances our product offerings within our Neurotechnology and Spine segment.
310764_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	In July 2011 we completed the acquisition of Memometal Technologies (Memometal) in an all cash transaction for $150, including the assumption of $9 in debt, as well as an additional $12 to be paid upon the completion of certain milestones.
310764_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	Memometal enhances our product offerings within our Reconstructive segment.
310764_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	In June 2011 we completed the acquisition of Orthovita, Inc. (Orthovita) in an all cash transaction for $316.
310764_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	The acquisition of Orthovita complements our existing product offerings, primarily within our Neurotechnology and Spine business segment.
310764_12_ITEM7_P10_S2	In February 2011 we completed the previously announced sale of our OP-1 product family for use in orthopaedic bone applications and our manufacturing facility based in West Lebanon, NH for total consideration of $60.
310764_12_ITEM7_P10_S3	In January 2011 we completed the previously announced acquisition of assets of the Neurovascular division of Boston Scientific Corporation (Neurovascular) in an all cash transaction for $1,450, with an additional $50 payment to be made upon completion of certain milestones.
310764_12_ITEM7_P10_S4	The acquisition of Neurovascular substantially enhances our presence in the neurotechnology market, allowing us to offer a comprehensive portfolio of products in both neurosurgical and neurovascular devices.
310764_12_ITEM7_P10_S5	In September 2011 we sold $750 of senior unsecured notes due September 2016 and in January 2010 we sold $500 of senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2015 and $500 of senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2020.
310764_12_ITEM7_P10_S6	The net proceeds from the offerings have been and will continue to be available for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, stock repurchases and other business opportunities.
310764_12_ITEM7_P10_S7	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our consolidated results of operations were:
310764_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	Our geographic and segment net sales were:
310764_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	Net sales increased 13.5% in 2011 after increasing 8.9% in 2010.
310764_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	In 2011, net sales grew by 6.1% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix, 2.4% due to the favorable impact of foreign currency and 6.8% due to acquisitions, which were partially offset by an unfavorable impact of 1.8% due to changes in price.
310764_12_ITEM7_P12_S2	In 2010, net sales grew by 6.9% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix, 1.0% due to the favorable impact of foreign currency and 2.6% due to acquisitions, which were partially offset by an unfavorable impact of 1.7% due to changes in price.
310764_12_ITEM7_P12_S3	In the United States, net sales increased 9.9% in 2011, after increasing 11.0% in 2010.

310764_12_ITEM7_P12_S5	In 2011 acquisitions contributed $496 or 6.8% to net sales, compared to $177 or 2.6% in 2010.
310764_12_ITEM7_P12_S6	The remaining increases in 2011 and 2010 were primarily due to higher United States shipments of Medsurg products and higher international shipments of MedSurg products and Neurotechnology and Spine products.
310764_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	The following geographical sales growth information by segment is provided to supplement the net sales information presented above:

310764_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	Reconstructive net sales in 2011 increased 4.5% from 2010, primarily due to a 3.4% increase in unit volume and changes in product mix.
310764_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	The increase in units sold was due to higher industry demand.
310764_12_ITEM7_P15_S2	In addition, net sales were negatively impacted by the unfavorable impact of changes in price, which were partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency.
310764_12_ITEM7_P15_S3	In constant currency Reconstructive net sales increased by 1.5% in 2011.
310764_12_ITEM7_P15_S4	Reconstructive net sales for 2010 increased 4.9% from 2009, primarily due to increases in unit volumes for Hips, Knees, and Trauma and Extremities products, due to higher worldwide industry demand.
310764_12_ITEM7_P15_S5	In constant currency Reconstructive net sales increased by 3.5% in 2010.
310764_12_ITEM7_P15_S6	MedSurg net sales in 2011 increased 12.7% from 2010, led by Medical while Endoscopy and Instruments also increased, primarily due to a 9.5% increase in unit volume and changes in product mix, the favorable impact of foreign currency and acquisitions.
310764_12_ITEM7_P15_S7	In constant currency MedSurg net sales increased by 11.2% in 2011.

310764_12_ITEM7_P15_S9	Net sales in 2010 were positively impacted by 7.1% from acquisitions; the remainder is due to increases in unit volume from higher worldwide demand.
310764_12_ITEM7_P15_S10	In constant currency MedSurg net sales increased by 14.7% in 2010.
310764_12_ITEM7_P15_S11	Neurotechnology and Spine net sales in 2011 increased 48.5% from 2010, primarily due to t he acquisition of Neurovascular; sales growth from acquisitions was 42.6%.
310764_12_ITEM7_P15_S12	The remainder of the increase included 6.3% due to increases in unit volume and changes in product mix and the favorable impact of foreign currency, which were partially offset by an unfavorable impact of changes in price.
310764_12_ITEM7_P15_S13	In constant currency Neurotechnology and Spine net sales in 2011 increased by 46.4%.
310764_12_ITEM7_P15_S14	Neurotechnology and Spine net sales in 2010 increased 6.1% from 2009, primarily due to increases in unit volumes in both Spine and Neurotechnology product lines, from higher worldwide demand.
310764_12_ITEM7_P15_S15	In constant currency Neurotechnology and Spine net sales in 2010 increased by 5.6%.
310764_12_ITEM7_P15_S16	Consolidated Cost of Sales Cost of sales increased 23.0% from 2010 to 33.8% of sales compared to 31.2% in 2010.
310764_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	The remaining increase in the cost of sales percentage was primarily due to the impact of lower pricing on sales resulting in an increase in cost of sales as a percent of sales and the impact of changes in product mix and of a weaker United States dollar on purchases from international manufacturing operations.
310764_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	Cost of sales in 2010 decreased 4.7% from 2009 to 31.2% of sales compared to 32.5% in 2009.
310764_12_ITEM7_P17_S2	The decrease in the cost of sales percentage was primarily due to lower excess and obsolete inventory charges, higher absorption due to higher production levels as well as a favorable impact from the effect of foreign currency on costs from our euro-based manufacturing sites.
310764_12_ITEM7_P17_S3	Research, Development and Engineering Expenses Research, development and engineering expenses represented 5.6% of sales in 2011 compared to 5.4% in 2010 and 5.0% in 2009.
310764_12_ITEM7_P17_S4	The higher spending levels are the result of our focus on new product development for anticipated future product launches and continued investments in new technologies.
310764_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2011 increased 16.4% and represented 37.9% of sales compared to 37.0% in 2010 and 37.3% in 2009.
310764_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	In 2011 we recorded $66 ($45 net of taxes) in transaction and acquisition costs and integration-related charges associated with the acquisitions of the Neurovascular, Orthovita, Memometal and Concentric businesses.
310764_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	In addition, in 2011 general and administrative expenses include the payment of an intellectual property infringement claim, offset by a favorable resolution of a value added tax issue.
310764_12_ITEM7_P19_S2	In 2010 we sold a manufacturing facility in France and recorded a gain of $24 ($13 net of taxes), which is included in general and administrative expenses.
310764_12_ITEM7_P19_S3	In 2009 we settled an outstanding patent infringement lawsuit and received $62 ($43 net of taxes) pursuant to a legal agreement.
310764_12_ITEM7_P19_S4	In 2011 we recorded $76 ($60 net of taxes) in restructuring charges related to focused reductions of our global workforce and other restructuring, expected to reduce our global workforce by approximately 5% and be substantially complete by the end of 2012 at a total cost of approximately $150 to $175.
310764_12_ITEM7_P19_S5	The actions were initiated in 2011 to provide efficiencies and realign resources in advance of the new Medical Device Excise Tax scheduled to begin in 2013, as well as to allow for continued investment in strategic areas and drive growth.
310764_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	In 2009 we recorded $67 ($49 net of taxes) in restructuring charges related to agency conversion charges associated with the termination of certain third-party agent agreements, asset impairment charges related primarily to identifiable intangible assets as a result of our decision to discontinue selling certain products, severance and related costs resulting from our decision to simplify the organization structure at our Biotech, EMEA, Japan and Canada divisions and contractual obligations and other charges in connection with the termination of various supplier contracts as well as other incidental costs related to the discontinued product lines.
310764_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	Property, plant and equipment impairment In 2010 we recorded a $124 ($76 net of taxes) non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount of certain assets to fair value related to our OP-1 product family and related manufacturing facility.
310764_12_ITEM7_P20_S2	Other Income (Expense) Other expense in 2011 decreased $22 from 2010, primarily due to reductions of accrued interest expense resulting from settlements reached with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
310764_12_ITEM7_P20_S3	We reached a favorable settlement regarding an IRS proposed adjustment to our previously filed 2003 through 2007 income tax returns, related to the income tax positions we had taken for our Irish cost sharing arrangements.
310764_12_ITEM7_P20_S4	We also reached a settlement with the IRS with respect to the allocation of income with a wholly owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico for the years 2006 through 2009.
310764_12_ITEM7_P20_S5	The positive effect on interest expense from these tax settlements helped offset lower average yields on our investments combined with lower cash and cash equivalent and marketable securities balances compared to 2010.
310764_12_ITEM7_P20_S6	The decrease in these balances and the corresponding reduction in interest and investment income was primarily due to the purchases of the Neurovascular, Orthovita, Memometal and Concentric businesses, which were funded with cash.
310764_12_ITEM7_P20_S7	Other expense in 2010 increased $52 from 2009 primarily due to lower average yields on our investments combined with higher interest cost on the debt issued in January 2010.
310764_12_ITEM7_P20_S8	Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate on earnings was 20.2%, 26.4% and 31.8% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
310764_12_ITEM7_P20_S9	The effective income tax rate for 2011 includes the net impact of the settlement with the IRS of income allocation issues with a wholly owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico and our Irish cost sharing arrangements, effective settlement of all United States federal tax matters for tax years 2003 through 2007 and charges for other uncertain income tax positions.
310764_12_ITEM7_P20_S10	The effective income tax rate for 2010 includes the impact of the property, plant and equipment impairment charge, the gain on sale of a manufacturing facility and the favorable income tax expense adjustment associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings to the United States completed in 2009.
310764_12_ITEM7_P20_S11	The effective income tax rate for 2009 includes the impact of restructuring charges, the patent litigation gain and the impact of the income tax expenses associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings.
310764_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	Net Earnings Net earnings in 2011 increased 5.7% from 2010 to $1,345.
310764_12_ITEM7_P22_S1	Basic net earnings per share in 2011 increased 8.4% from 2010 to $3.48, and diluted net earnings per share in 2011 increased 8.2% from 2010 to $3.45.

310764_12_ITEM7_P22_S4	Reported net earnings includes benefits from settlements and other adjustments related to uncertain tax positions, restructuring and related charges and acquisition and integration related charges related to the Neurovascular, Orthovita, Memometal and Concentric acquisitions, including transaction costs, integration related costs and additional cost of sales for inventory sold in the year that was stepped up to fair value.
310764_12_ITEM7_P22_S5	Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted net earnings in 2011 increased 9.0% to $1,448 after increasing 12.6% in 2010.
310764_12_ITEM7_P22_S6	Adjusted diluted net earnings per share in 2011 increased 11.7% to $3.72 after increasing 12.9% in 2010.
310764_12_ITEM7_P22_S7	The following reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, reported net earnings and diluted net earnings per share:
310764_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	The weighted-average basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of our non-GAAP financial measures are the same as the weighted-average shares outstanding used in the calculation of our reported per share amounts.
310764_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Operating Activities Operating cash flow was $1,434 in 2011, a decrease of 7.3% from 2010.
310764_12_ITEM7_P24_S1	Operating cash flow resulted primarily from net earnings adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, sale of inventory stepped-up to fair value at acquisition and deferred income taxes), partially offset by an increase in working capital.
310764_12_ITEM7_P24_S2	The net of accounts receivable, inventory, loaner instrumentation and accounts payable consumed $498 of operating cash flow in 2011.
310764_12_ITEM7_P24_S3	Inventory consumed $166 of operating cash flow primarily due to the building of inventory related to acquisitions and other business growth, increased stock levels in advance of new product introductions and higher inventory levels in support of anticipated 2012 sales growth.
310764_12_ITEM7_P24_S4	Inventory days on hand increased by 4 days due to the impact of the above.
310764_12_ITEM7_P24_S5	Accounts receivable used $143, primarily due to the building of accounts receivable related to acquisitions and other business growth.
310764_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.

310764_12_ITEM7_P26_S6	Accounts receivable days sales outstanding of 56 were unchanged from the prior year.
310764_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	Investing Activities Net investing activities consumed $2,135 of cash in 2011 and $795 of cash in 2010, primarily due to acquisitions and capital spending, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets.

310764_12_ITEM7_P28_S6	The increase in dividend payments resulted from increases in our quarterly dividend from $0.15 per share in 2010 to $0.18 per share in 2011.
310764_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and overall cost of capital.
310764_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	In September 2011 we sold $750 of senior unsecured notes due September 2016 and in January 2010 we sold $500 of senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2015 and $500 of senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2020.
310764_12_ITEM7_P29_S2	The net proceeds from the offerings have been and will continue to be available for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, stock repurchases and other business opportunities.

310764_12_ITEM7_P29_S6	We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations.
310764_12_ITEM7_P29_S7	We have funded, and may continue from time to time to fund, ourselves in the capital markets.
310764_12_ITEM7_P29_S8	We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due.
310764_12_ITEM7_P29_S9	In addition, we have a $1,000 credit facility with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient funding to meet short-term financing requirements.
310764_12_ITEM7_P29_S10	We had approximately $1,098 of borrowing capacity available under all of our existing credit facilities at December 31, 2011.
310764_12_ITEM7_P29_S11	At December 31, 2011, approximately 62% of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were held in locations outside of the United States.
310764_12_ITEM7_P29_S12	These funds are considered indefinitely reinvested to be used to expand operations either organically or through acquisitions outside the United States.
310764_12_ITEM7_P29_S13	We do not intend to repatriate any significant amounts of cash in the foreseeable future.
310764_12_ITEM7_P29_S14	We do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.
310764_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND FORWARD-LOOKING CASH REQUIREMENTS As further described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2011 our defined benefit pension plans were in an underfunded status of $106, of which approximately $94 related to plans outside the United States.
310764_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	Due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and the potential for changes in legislation in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods, beyond 2012, in which contributions to fund defined benefit pension plans will be made.
310764_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	As further described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2011, we have recorded a liability for uncertain income tax positions of $249.
310764_12_ITEM7_P32_S2	Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits, we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made.
310764_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	Our future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than one year, including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business, are:
310764_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES In preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application.
310764_12_ITEM7_P34_S1	These include allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, income taxes, acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets, and legal and other contingencies.
310764_12_ITEM7_P34_S2	We believe these accounting policies, and others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition.
310764_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable.
310764_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	We make estimates regarding the future ability of our customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends.
310764_12_ITEM7_P35_S2	If actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.
310764_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	We maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs.
310764_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	We make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends.
310764_12_ITEM7_P36_S2	If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.
310764_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	Income Taxes Our annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes.
310764_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements.
310764_12_ITEM7_P38_S1	Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary, reversing over time, such as depreciation expense.
310764_12_ITEM7_P38_S2	These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.
310764_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement.
310764_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred, the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction has already been taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment.
310764_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes.

310764_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods.
310764_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.
310764_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments.
310764_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority.
310764_12_ITEM7_P44_S2	These differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment.
310764_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes.
310764_12_ITEM7_P45_S1	We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly.
310764_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions.
310764_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
310764_12_ITEM7_P46_S2	Because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate.
310764_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	We account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting.
310764_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	Under the purchase method, our Consolidated Financial Statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition.
310764_12_ITEM7_P47_S2	In addition, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed must be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill.
310764_12_ITEM7_P47_S3	Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives.
310764_12_ITEM7_P47_S4	Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant items.
310764_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain.
310764_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets.
310764_12_ITEM7_P49_S1	Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.
310764_12_ITEM7_P49_S2	Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.
310764_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment.
310764_12_ITEM7_P50_S1	Certain intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands.
310764_12_ITEM7_P50_S2	Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives.
310764_12_ITEM7_P50_S3	Our assessment as to trademarks and brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, trademark and/or brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarks or brands are sold.
310764_12_ITEM7_P50_S4	Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors.
310764_12_ITEM7_P50_S5	All of our acquired technology and customer-related intangibles are expected to have determinable useful lives.
310764_12_ITEM7_P50_S6	The costs of determinable-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life.
310764_12_ITEM7_P50_S7	The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment.
310764_12_ITEM7_P50_S8	Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles.
310764_12_ITEM7_P50_S9	We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year.
310764_12_ITEM7_P50_S10	We have early-adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-08, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other: Testing Goodwill for Impairment , which permits us to consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill.
310764_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	In certain circumstances, we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability.
310764_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	In those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level.
310764_12_ITEM7_P51_S2	We test individual indefinite-lived intangibles by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value.
310764_12_ITEM7_P51_S3	We determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the income approach.
310764_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows.
310764_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value.
310764_12_ITEM7_P52_S2	Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans.
310764_12_ITEM7_P52_S3	We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants.
310764_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, indefinite-lived intangible assets may be reclassified to a determinable life asset and an additional impairment assessment may be performed.
310764_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	We did not recognize any material impairment charges for goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets during the years presented as our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset fair values exceeded their respective recorded values.
310764_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	However, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values.
310764_12_ITEM7_P55_S2	A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect the financial statements in any given year.
310764_12_ITEM7_P55_S3	The recorded value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets from recently acquired businesses are derived from more recent business operating plans and macroeconomic environmental conditions and, therefore, are more susceptible to an adverse change that could require an impairment charge.
310764_12_ITEM7_P55_S4	We review long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
310764_12_ITEM7_P55_S5	The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level, as defined.
310764_12_ITEM7_P55_S6	Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections.
310764_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique.
310764_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	Assets classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
310764_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	Legal and Other Contingencies We are involved in various proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property, and other matters that are more fully described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_12_ITEM7_P58_S1	The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time.
310764_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory and equitable relief, which could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief.
310764_12_ITEM7_P59_S1	For legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management's best estimate of the probable cost, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded.
310764_12_ITEM7_P59_S2	The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies.
310764_12_ITEM7_P59_S3	If actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.
310764_12_ITEM7_P59_S4	To partially mitigate losses arising from unfavorable outcomes in such matters, we purchase third-party insurance coverage subject to certain deductibles and loss limitations.
310764_12_ITEM7_P59_S5	Future operating results may be unfavorably impacted by any settlement payments or losses beyond the amounts of insurance carried.
310764_12_ITEM7_P59_S6	In addition, such matters may negatively impact our ability to obtain cost-effective third-party insurance coverage in future periods.
310764_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS No new accounting pronouncements that were issued or became effective during the year have had or are expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_12_ITEM7_P60_S1	For a discussion of new accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	We distribute our products throughout the world.
310764_12_ITEM7_P61_S1	As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak economic conditions or changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
310764_12_ITEM7_P61_S2	Our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the United States dollar, European currencies, in particular the euro, Swiss franc and the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar.
310764_12_ITEM7_P61_S3	We develop and manufacture products in the United States, China, France, Germany, Ireland, Puerto Rico and Switzerland and incur costs in the applicable local currencies.
310764_12_ITEM7_P61_S4	This worldwide deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on our cost of sales.
310764_12_ITEM7_P61_S5	We enter into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates.
310764_12_ITEM7_P61_S6	These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products.
310764_12_ITEM7_P61_S7	The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies.
310764_12_ITEM7_P61_S8	All forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period, with resulting gains (losses) included in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
310764_12_ITEM7_P61_S9	The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points.
310764_12_ITEM7_P61_S10	A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar would change the December 31, 2011 fair value by approximately $48.

310764_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	counterparties on our outstanding forward currency exchange contracts, but we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our counterparties.
310764_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	We have certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged.
310764_12_ITEM7_P64_S1	These investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
310764_12_ITEM7_P64_S2	For 2011, the strengthening of United States dollar relative to foreign currencies decreased the value of these investments in net assets and the related foreign currency translation adjustment loss in shareholders' equity by $20, to $176 from $196 at December 31, 2010.
310764_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	In April 2011 lawsuits brought by Hill-Rom Company, Inc. and affiliated entities against us were filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin and the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.
310764_12_ITEM7_P65_S1	The suits allege infringement under United States patent laws with respect to certain patient handling equipment manufactured and sold by us and seek damages and permanent injunctions.
310764_12_ITEM7_P65_S2	The Wisconsin lawsuit has subsequently been transferred to the United States District Court in Indiana.
310764_12_ITEM7_P65_S3	We intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these matters.
310764_12_ITEM7_P65_S4	In the third quarter of 2010, we received a subpoena from the United States Department of Justice related to sales, marketing and regulatory matters related to the Stryker PainPump.
310764_12_ITEM7_P65_S5	Also in the third quarter of 2010, we received a subpoena from the United States Department of Justice related to the sales and marketing of the OtisKnee device.
310764_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	In March 2010 a shareholder's derivative action complaint against certain of our current and former Directors and Officers was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan Southern Division.
310764_12_ITEM7_P66_S1	This lawsuit was brought by the Westchester Putnam Counties Heavy and Highway Laborers Local 60 Benefit Funds and Laborers Local 235 Benefit Funds.
310764_12_ITEM7_P66_S2	The complaint alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duties and gross mismanagement in connection with certain product recalls, United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warning letters, government investigations relating to physician compensation and the criminal proceeding brought against our Biotech division.
310764_12_ITEM7_P66_S3	The case has been stayed while a Special Committee of the Board of Directors evaluates the claims.
310764_12_ITEM7_P67_S0	In January 2010 a purported class action lawsuit against us was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of those who purchased our common stock between January 25, 2007 and November 13, 2008, inclusive.
310764_12_ITEM7_P67_S1	The lawsuit seeks remedies under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
310764_12_ITEM7_P67_S2	In May 2010 the lawsuit was transferred to the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan Southern Division.
310764_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	In 2009 a federal grand jury in the District of Massachusetts returned an indictment charging Stryker Biotech LLC and certain then-current employees and a former employee of Stryker Biotech with wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the FDA, distribution of a misbranded device and false statements to the FDA.
310764_12_ITEM7_P68_S1	In January 2012 Stryker Biotech reached a settlement with the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts, under which Stryker pled to one misdemeanor charge and paid a non-tax deductible fine of $15.
310764_12_ITEM7_P68_S2	As a result of this resolution, the Department of Justice dismissed all thirteen felony charges against Stryker Biotech contained in the 2009 federal grand jury indictment.
310764_12_ITEM7_P68_S3	All of the charges against the then-current and former employees of Stryker Biotech have also been dismissed.
310764_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	In 2007, the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS) issued a civil subpoena to us in seeking to determine whether we violated various laws by paying consulting fees and providing other things of value to orthopedic surgeons and healthcare and educational institutions as inducements to use Stryker's orthopedic medical devices in procedures paid for in whole or in part by Medicare.
310764_12_ITEM7_P69_S1	The investigation is ongoing and we have produced numerous documents and other materials to HHS in response to the subpoena.
310764_12_ITEM7_P70_S0	In 2007 we disclosed that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made an inquiry of us regarding possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in connection with the sale of medical devices in certain foreign countries.
310764_12_ITEM7_P70_S1	Subsequently, in 2008, we received a subpoena from the United States Department of Justice, Criminal Division, requesting certain documents for the period since January 1, 2000 in connection with the SEC inquiry.
310764_12_ITEM7_P70_S2	We are fully cooperating with the United States Department of Justice and the SEC regarding these matters.
310764_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are included in the "Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity" and "Other Information" sections of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition in Item 7 of this report.

310764_12_ITEM8_P0_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Stryker Corporation :
310764_12_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011.
310764_12_ITEM8_P1_S1	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a).

310764_12_ITEM8_P1_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
310764_12_ITEM8_P2_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
310764_12_ITEM8_P2_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
310764_12_ITEM8_P3_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
310764_12_ITEM8_P3_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
310764_12_ITEM8_P3_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
310764_12_ITEM8_P4_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
310764_12_ITEM8_P4_S1	Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
310764_12_ITEM8_P5_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Stryker Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 13, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

310764_12_ITEM8_P14_S0	Stryker Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2011 NOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature of Operations: Stryker Corporation (the Company, we, us, or our ) is one of the world's leading medical technology companies.
310764_12_ITEM8_P14_S1	Our products include implants used in joint replacement, trauma, and spinal surgeries; surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems; endoscopic and communications systems; patient handling and emergency medical equipment, as well as other medical device products used in a variety of medical specialties.
310764_12_ITEM8_P15_S0	The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its subsidiaries.
310764_12_ITEM8_P16_S0	Use of Estimates: Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures.
310764_12_ITEM8_P16_S1	These estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future.
310764_12_ITEM8_P16_S2	Estimates are used in accounting for, among other items, pensions, stock options, valuation of acquired intangible assets, useful lives for depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain income tax positions and contingencies.
310764_12_ITEM8_P16_S3	Actual results may ultimately differ from estimates.
310764_12_ITEM8_P17_S0	Sales are recognized when revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned.
310764_12_ITEM8_P17_S1	Our policy is to recognize revenue when title to the product, ownership and risk of loss transfer to the customer, which can be on the date of shipment, the date of receipt by the customer or for most reconstructive products when we receive appropriate notification that the product has been used or implanted.
310764_12_ITEM8_P18_S0	A provision for estimated sales returns, discounts, rebates and other sales incentives is recorded as a reduction of net sales in the same period that the revenue is recognized.
310764_12_ITEM8_P18_S1	Shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in net sales.
310764_12_ITEM8_P19_S0	Cost of Sales: Cost of sales is primarily comprised of direct materials and supplies consumed in the manufacture of product, as well as manufacturing labor, depreciation expense and direct overhead expense necessary to acquire and convert the purchased materials and supplies into finished product.
310764_12_ITEM8_P19_S1	Cost of sales also includes the cost to distribute products to customers, inbound freight costs, warehousing costs and other shipping and handling activity.
310764_12_ITEM8_P20_S0	Research, development and engineering expenses: Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and were $462 , $394 and $336 , in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
310764_12_ITEM8_P20_S1	Costs include expenditures for new product and manufacturing process innovation and improvements to existing products and processes.
310764_12_ITEM8_P20_S2	Costs primarily consist of salaries, wages, consulting and depreciation and maintenance of research facilities and equipment.
310764_12_ITEM8_P20_S3	Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of selling expenses, marketing expenses, administrative and other indirect overhead costs, amortization of loaner instrumentation, depreciation and amortization expense of non-manufacturing assets and other miscellaneous operating items.
310764_12_ITEM8_P21_S0	Currency Translation: Financial statements of subsidiaries outside the United States generally are measured using the local currency as the functional currency.
310764_12_ITEM8_P21_S1	Adjustments to translate those statements into United States dollars are recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI).
310764_12_ITEM8_P21_S2	Currency translation adjustments in accumulated OCI were a gain of $176 at December 2011 and a gain of $196 at December 2010.
310764_12_ITEM8_P22_S0	Transactional exchange gains and losses are reflected in net earnings.
310764_12_ITEM8_P23_S0	Cash Equivalents: Highly liquid investments with remaining stated maturities of three months or less when purchased are considered cash equivalents and recorded at cost.
310764_12_ITEM8_P24_S0	Marketable Securities: Marketable securities consist of marketable debt securities and certificates of deposit and mutual funds.
310764_12_ITEM8_P24_S1	Mutual funds are acquired to offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements and are expected to be used to settle these liabilities.
310764_12_ITEM8_P25_S0	In the event of a rating downgrade below the minimum credit quality subsequent to purchase, the marketable security investment is evaluated to determine the appropriate action to take to minimize the overall risk to our marketable security investment portfolio.
310764_12_ITEM8_P25_S1	As of December 31, 2011, only 1% of our investments in marketable securities had a credit quality rating of less than single A (per Standard Poor s or Fitch) and A2 (per Moody s Corporation).
310764_12_ITEM8_P26_S0	Our marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and trading securities.
310764_12_ITEM8_P27_S0	Accounts receivable consists of trade and other miscellaneous receivables.

310764_12_ITEM8_P29_S0	doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable.
310764_12_ITEM8_P29_S1	Estimates are made regarding the ability of customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends.
310764_12_ITEM8_P29_S2	Accounts receivable are written off when all reasonable collection efforts are exhausted.
310764_12_ITEM8_P30_S0	Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost generally determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method.
310764_12_ITEM8_P31_S0	For excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell specific products at prices in excess of current carrying costs, reserves are maintained to reduce current carrying cost to market prices.
310764_12_ITEM8_P32_S0	Financial Instruments: Our financial instruments consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, other investments, accounts payable, debt and foreign currency exchange contracts.
310764_12_ITEM8_P32_S1	With the exception of our long-term debt, which is discussed in further detail in Note 8, our estimates of fair value for financial instruments approximate their carrying amounts as of December 31, 2011 and 2010.
310764_12_ITEM8_P33_S0	We recognize all marketable securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.
310764_12_ITEM8_P33_S1	Adjustments to the fair value of marketable securities that are classified as available-for-sale are recorded as increases or decreases, net of income taxes, within accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) in shareholders equity and adjustments to the fair value of marketable securities that are classified as trading are recorded in earnings.
310764_12_ITEM8_P34_S0	The amortized cost of marketable debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity computed under the effective interest method.
310764_12_ITEM8_P34_S1	Such amortization is included in other income (expense) along with interest and realized gains and losses.
310764_12_ITEM8_P35_S0	The cost of securities sold is determined by the specific identification method.
310764_12_ITEM8_P36_S0	We review declines in the fair value of our investments classified as available-for-sale for impairment to determine whether the decline in fair value is an other-than-temporary impairment.
310764_12_ITEM8_P36_S1	The resulting losses from other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale marketable securities are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
310764_12_ITEM8_P37_S0	We recognize all derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.
310764_12_ITEM8_P37_S1	We enter into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting our risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates.
310764_12_ITEM8_P37_S2	These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products.
310764_12_ITEM8_P37_S3	The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies.
310764_12_ITEM8_P37_S4	All forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period, with resulting gains (losses) included in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
310764_12_ITEM8_P38_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost.
310764_12_ITEM8_P38_S1	Depreciation is computed by either the straight-line or declining-balance method over the estimated useful lives of 3 to 30 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 10 years for machinery and equipment.
310764_12_ITEM8_P39_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2010, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our OP-1 product family for use in orthopaedic bone applications and the related manufacturing facility in West Lebanon, NH.
310764_12_ITEM8_P39_S1	As a result of the announcement we recorded a $76 (net of taxes) impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the associated assets to their fair value.
310764_12_ITEM8_P39_S2	At December 31, 2010 the assets held for sale included in current assets in our Consolidated Balance sheet totaled $62 ( $29 net property, plant and equipment, $25 inventories and $8 other).
310764_12_ITEM8_P39_S3	On February 1, 2011, we completed the sale for total consideration of $60 .
310764_12_ITEM8_P39_S4	No material gain or loss was recorded upon the completion of the transaction.
310764_12_ITEM8_P40_S0	During the third quarter of 2010, we sold a manufacturing facility in France for total consideration of $53 in an all cash transaction and recorded a gain of $13 (net of taxes).
310764_12_ITEM8_P40_S1	The transaction included a 5 -year supply agreement in volumes commensurate with the pre-sale production levels and is contingent on the purchaser's ability to provide products that meet specific quality standards.
310764_12_ITEM8_P40_S2	The supply agreement may be terminated if such a material breach occurs.
310764_12_ITEM8_P41_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of tangible net assets of acquired businesses at the acquisition date, after amounts allocated to other identifiable intangible assets.
310764_12_ITEM8_P41_S1	Factors that contribute to the recognition of goodwill include securing synergies that are specific to our business and not available to other market participants and are expected to increase revenues and profits; acquisition of a talented workforce; cost savings opportunities; the strategic benefit of expanding our presence in the orthobiologics and neurotechnology markets; and diversifying our product portfolio.
310764_12_ITEM8_P42_S0	The fair values of other identifiable intangible assets are primarily determined using the income approach.
310764_12_ITEM8_P42_S1	Other intangible assets include, but are not limited to, developed technology, customer relationships (which reflect expected continued customer patronage) and trademarks and patents and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 4 to 40 years.
310764_12_ITEM8_P43_S0	Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets Impairment Tests: We perform our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year.
310764_12_ITEM8_P43_S1	We have early-adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-08, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other: Testing Goodwill for Impairment , which permits us to consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill.
310764_12_ITEM8_P44_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_12_ITEM8_P45_S0	certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability.
310764_12_ITEM8_P46_S0	We review long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
310764_12_ITEM8_P46_S1	The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level, as defined.
310764_12_ITEM8_P46_S2	Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the asset's useful life based on updated projections.
310764_12_ITEM8_P46_S3	If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique.
310764_12_ITEM8_P47_S0	Assets classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
310764_12_ITEM8_P48_S0	Loaner instrumentation represents the net book value of loaner instruments for surgical implants provided by us to customers.
310764_12_ITEM8_P48_S1	Loaner instrumentation is amortized on a straight-line basis over a 3 -year period.
310764_12_ITEM8_P48_S2	Amortization expense for loaner instrumentation is included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
310764_12_ITEM8_P49_S0	Stock Options: At December 31, 2011, we had key employee and director stock option plans that are described more fully in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_12_ITEM8_P49_S1	We measure the cost of employee stock options based on the grant-date fair value and recognize that cost using the straight-line method over the period during which a recipient is required to provide services in exchange for the options, typically the vesting period.
310764_12_ITEM8_P49_S2	The weighted-average fair value per share of options granted during 2011, 2010 and 2009, estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, was $17.14 , $15.87 and $13.09 , respectively.
310764_12_ITEM8_P49_S3	The fair value of options granted was estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:
310764_12_ITEM8_P50_S0	The risk-free interest rate for periods within the expected life of options granted is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
310764_12_ITEM8_P51_S0	Expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock.
310764_12_ITEM8_P51_S1	The expected option life, representing the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, is based on historical option exercise and employee termination data.
310764_12_ITEM8_P52_S0	Income Taxes: Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted income tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.
310764_12_ITEM8_P52_S1	Deferred income tax benefits generally represent the change in net deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year.
310764_12_ITEM8_P52_S2	Other amounts result from adjustments related to acquisitions as appropriate.
310764_12_ITEM8_P52_S3	Interest expense and penalties incurred associated with uncertain income tax positions are included in other income (expense).
310764_12_ITEM8_P53_S0	We operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States.
310764_12_ITEM8_P53_S1	Accordingly, management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations.
310764_12_ITEM8_P53_S2	Income tax authorities in these jurisdictions regularly perform audits of our income tax filings.
310764_12_ITEM8_P53_S3	Income tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing, product royalty and foreign branch arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates.
310764_12_ITEM8_P54_S0	Legal and Other Contingencies: We are involved in various proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property and other matters that are more fully described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_12_ITEM8_P54_S1	The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time.
310764_12_ITEM8_P55_S0	In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory and equitable relief, that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief.
310764_12_ITEM8_P55_S1	For legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management s best estimate of the probable cost, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded.
310764_12_ITEM8_P55_S2	The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies.
310764_12_ITEM8_P56_S0	Accumulated Other Comprehensive Gain (Loss): The components of accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) are as follows:
310764_12_ITEM8_P57_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_12_ITEM8_P58_S0	Recently Issued Accounting Standards: In 2011 the FASB amended the provisions of the Fair Value Measurement topic of the FASB Codification.
310764_12_ITEM8_P58_S1	This amendment provides a consistent definition of fair value and ensures that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
310764_12_ITEM8_P58_S2	This topic changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements, particularly for Level 3 fair value measurements.
310764_12_ITEM8_P58_S3	These provisions are effective for reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011, applied prospectively.
310764_12_ITEM8_P59_S0	The adoption of this amendment will not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_12_ITEM8_P60_S0	In 2011 the FASB amended the provisions of the Comprehensive Income topic of the FASB Codification.
310764_12_ITEM8_P60_S1	The amended provisions were issued to enhance comparability between entities that report under GAAP and IFRS and to provide a more consistent method of presenting non-owner transactions that affect an entity's equity.
310764_12_ITEM8_P60_S2	This topic eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in shareholders' equity and requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements.
310764_12_ITEM8_P60_S3	These amended provisions are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011.
310764_12_ITEM8_P60_S4	Early adoption of the new guidance is permitted and full retrospective application is required.
310764_12_ITEM8_P60_S5	The adoption of this amendment will not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements as the amendment impacts presentation only.
310764_12_ITEM8_P61_S0	In 2011 the FASB amended the provisions of the Intangibles-Goodwill and Other topic of the FASB Codification.
310764_12_ITEM8_P61_S1	The amended provisions were issued to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment.
310764_12_ITEM8_P61_S2	This topic will allow companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standards.
310764_12_ITEM8_P61_S3	These amended provisions are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted.
310764_12_ITEM8_P61_S4	We have elected to enact early adoption of this amendment, which did not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_12_ITEM8_P62_S0	In 2011 the FASB amended the provisions of the Balance Sheet, Disclosure about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities topic of the FASB Codification.
310764_12_ITEM8_P62_S1	The amended provisions provide new disclosures for recognized financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either offset on the balance sheet or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement.
310764_12_ITEM8_P62_S2	The amended provisions are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2013.
310764_12_ITEM8_P62_S3	The amended provisions are required to be applied retrospectively for all prior periods presented.
310764_12_ITEM8_P62_S4	The adoption of this amendment will not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_12_ITEM8_P62_S5	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the presentation used in 2011.
310764_12_ITEM8_P62_S6	NOTE 2 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS In January 2012, Stryker Biotech reached a settlement with the United States Attorney s Office for the District of Massachusetts.
310764_12_ITEM8_P62_S7	As part of the settlement, we pled to one misdemeanor charge and paid a non-tax-deductible fine of $15 .
310764_12_ITEM8_P62_S8	As a result of this resolution, the Department of Justice dismissed all thirteen felony charges against Stryker Biotech contained in a 2009 federal grand jury indictment.
310764_12_ITEM8_P62_S9	We had previously disclosed that our Biotech division was the target of a federal grand jury investigation being conducted by the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts.
310764_12_ITEM8_P62_S10	The settlement represented a recognized subsequent event and accordingly was recorded in our fourth quarter 2011 results.
310764_12_ITEM8_P62_S11	We have evaluated subsequent events after December 31, 2011 and concluded that no other material transactions occurred subsequent to that date that provided additional evidence about conditions that existed at or after December 31, 2011 that require adjustment to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_12_ITEM8_P63_S0	NOTE 3 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Accounting guidance on fair value measurements for certain financial assets and liabilities requires that financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
310764_12_ITEM8_P63_S1	Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
310764_12_ITEM8_P63_S2	Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity's own assumptions or external inputs from active markets.
310764_12_ITEM8_P64_S0	When applying fair value principles in the valuation of assets and liabilities, we are required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
310764_12_ITEM8_P65_S0	We calculate the fair value of our Level 1 and Level 2 instruments based on the exchange traded price of similar or identical instruments, where available, or based on other observable inputs.
310764_12_ITEM8_P65_S1	The fair value of our Level 3 instruments is calculated as the net present value of expected cash flows based on externally provided or obtained inputs.
310764_12_ITEM8_P65_S2	Certain Level 3 assets may also be based on sale prices of similar assets.
310764_12_ITEM8_P66_S0	Our fair value calculations take into consideration our credit risk and that of our counterparties.
310764_12_ITEM8_P66_S1	We have not changed our valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the year.
310764_12_ITEM8_P67_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_12_ITEM8_P68_S0	Our valuation of our financial instruments by the aforementioned pricing categories is:
310764_12_ITEM8_P69_S0	The following is a rollforward of the assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs (Level 3):
310764_12_ITEM8_P70_S0	In June 2010 we exercised the Auction Rate Securities (ARS) Rights agreement (ARS Rights) that we had entered into in 2008 with UBS Financial Services Inc. (UBS), one of our investment providers, whereby we received the right to sell our ARS at par value to UBS at any time during the period from June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012.
310764_12_ITEM8_P70_S1	Pursuant to this agreement, we redeemed our entire remaining outstanding ARS investment of $140 par value.
310764_12_ITEM8_P70_S2	As a result of this election, in 2010 we recorded losses of $17 in other income (expense) to recognize the change in fair value estimate of our ARS Rights.
310764_12_ITEM8_P70_S3	These losses were offset by corresponding gains in the fair value estimate of the related ARS investment.
310764_12_ITEM8_P70_S4	The following is a summary of our marketable securities:
310764_12_ITEM8_P71_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_12_ITEM8_P72_S0	The unrealized losses on our available-for-sale marketable securities were primarily caused by increases in interest yields as a result of continued challenging conditions in the global credit markets.
310764_12_ITEM8_P72_S1	While many of these investments have been downgraded by rating agencies since their initial purchase, less than 1% of our investments in corporate and asset-backed debt securities had a credit quality rating of less than single A (per Standard Poor s or Fitch).
310764_12_ITEM8_P72_S2	Because we do not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, we do not consider those investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2011.
310764_12_ITEM8_P73_S0	The cost and estimated fair value of available-for-sale marketable securities at December 31, 2011 by contractual maturity are:
310764_12_ITEM8_P74_S0	The gross unrealized losses and fair value of investments with unrealized losses that are not deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, aggregated by investment category and length of time that the individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at December 31, are as follows:
310764_12_ITEM8_P75_S0	Interest and marketable securities income totaled $34 , $49 and $54 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and is included in other income (expense).
310764_12_ITEM8_P76_S0	The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points.
310764_12_ITEM8_P76_S1	We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on our outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our counterparties.
310764_12_ITEM8_P77_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, recognized foreign currency transaction gains (losses) included in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings were ($3) , $7 and ($1) , respectively.
310764_12_ITEM8_P77_S1	The outstanding derivative contracts and their effects on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2011 and 2010 were:
310764_12_ITEM8_P78_S0	In October 2011 we acquired Concentric Medical, Inc. (Concentric), which manufactures and markets minimally invasive products for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, in an all cash transaction for $135 .
310764_12_ITEM8_P78_S1	The acquisition of Concentric enhances our product offerings within our Neurotechnology and Spine segment.
310764_12_ITEM8_P79_S0	In July 2011 we acquired Memometal Technologies (Memometal) in an all cash transaction for $150 , including assumed debt of $9 , and an additional $12 to be paid upon the completion of certain milestones.
310764_12_ITEM8_P79_S1	Memometal develops, manufactures and markets products for extremity (hand and foot) indications.
310764_12_ITEM8_P79_S2	The acquisition of Memometal enhances our product offerings within our Reconstructive segment.
310764_12_ITEM8_P80_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_12_ITEM8_P81_S0	In June 2011 we acquired Orthovita, Inc. (Orthovita), a developer and manufacturer of orthobiologic and biosurgery products, in an all cash transaction for $316 .
310764_12_ITEM8_P81_S1	The acquisition of Orthovita complements our existing product offerings, primarily within our Neurotechnology and Spine business segment.
310764_12_ITEM8_P82_S0	In January 2011 we acquired the assets of the Neurovascular division of Boston Scientific Corporation (Neurovascular) in an all cash transaction for $1,450 , with an additional $50 payment to be made upon completion of certain milestones.
310764_12_ITEM8_P82_S1	The acquisition of Neurovascular substantially enhances our presence in the neurotechnology market, allowing us to offer a comprehensive portfolio of products in both neurosurgical and neurovascular devices.
310764_12_ITEM8_P83_S0	The effects of all acquisitions completed in 2011 are included in our Consolidated Results of Operations prospectively from the date of acquisition.
310764_12_ITEM8_P83_S1	Pro forma consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 would not differ significantly as a result of these acquisitions.
310764_12_ITEM8_P84_S0	The purchase price allocations have been based upon preliminary valuations, and our estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period as valuations are finalized.
310764_12_ITEM8_P84_S1	The allocation of the preliminary purchase price to the acquired net assets of acquisitions completed in 2011 was:
310764_12_ITEM8_P85_S0	NOTE 6 - GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS We completed our annual impairment tests of goodwill and have concluded that no impairment exists.
310764_12_ITEM8_P85_S1	The changes in the net carrying amount of goodwill by segment are as follows:
310764_12_ITEM8_P86_S0	The following is a summary of our other intangible assets:
310764_12_ITEM8_P87_S0	The estimated amortization expense for each of the five succeeding years is as follows:
310764_12_ITEM8_P88_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_12_ITEM8_P89_S0	NOTE 7 - CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS Contingencies We are involved in various proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property and other matters.
310764_12_ITEM8_P89_S1	The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time.
310764_12_ITEM8_P90_S0	In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory and equitable relief, that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief.
310764_12_ITEM8_P90_S1	For legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management's best estimate of the probable cost, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded.
310764_12_ITEM8_P90_S2	The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies.
310764_12_ITEM8_P91_S0	In April 2011 lawsuits brought by Hill-Rom Company, Inc. and affiliated entities against us were filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin and the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.
310764_12_ITEM8_P91_S1	The suits allege infringement under United States patent laws with respect to certain patient handling equipment manufactured and sold by us and seek damages and permanent injunctions.
310764_12_ITEM8_P91_S2	The Wisconsin lawsuit has subsequently been transferred to the U.S. District Court in Indiana.
310764_12_ITEM8_P91_S3	We intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these matters.

310764_12_ITEM8_P92_S0	In March 2010 a shareholder's derivative action complaint against certain of our current and former Directors and Officers was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan Southern Division.
310764_12_ITEM8_P92_S1	This lawsuit was brought by the Westchester Putnam Counties Heavy and Highway Laborers Local 60 Benefit Funds and Laborers Local 235 Benefit Funds.

310764_12_ITEM8_P93_S1	The lawsuit seeks remedies under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
310764_12_ITEM8_P93_S2	In May 2010 the lawsuit was transferred to the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan Southern Division.
310764_12_ITEM8_P94_S0	In 2009 a federal grand jury in the District of Massachusetts returned an indictment charging Stryker Biotech LLC and certain then-current employees and a former employee of Stryker Biotech with wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the FDA, distribution of a misbranded device and false statements to the FDA.
310764_12_ITEM8_P94_S1	In January 2012 Stryker Biotech reached a settlement with the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts, under which Stryker pled to one misdemeanor charge and paid a non-tax deductible fine of $15 .

310764_12_ITEM8_P94_S3	All of the charges against the then-current and former employees of Stryker Biotech have also been dismissed.
310764_12_ITEM8_P95_S0	In 2007, the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS) issued a civil subpoena to us in seeking to determine whether we violated various laws by paying consulting fees and providing other things of value to orthopedic surgeons and healthcare and educational institutions as inducements to use Stryker's orthopedic medical devices in procedures paid for in whole or in part by Medicare.
310764_12_ITEM8_P95_S1	The investigation is ongoing and we have produced numerous documents and other materials to HHS in response to the subpoena.
310764_12_ITEM8_P96_S0	In 2007 we disclosed that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made an inquiry of us regarding possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in connection with the sale of medical devices in certain foreign countries.

310764_12_ITEM8_P103_S0	On July 15, 2011, we entered into a commercial paper program (the Program) under which we may issue, on a private placement basis, unsecured commercial paper notes (the Notes) up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $500 .

310764_12_ITEM8_P106_S6	Purchases are to be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.
310764_12_ITEM8_P107_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_12_ITEM8_P108_S0	We did not make any repurchases pursuant to the $500 repurchase program announced in 2011 during 2011.
310764_12_ITEM8_P108_S1	Under the $500 program announced in 2010, we repurchased 6.3 million shares at a cost of $297 during 2011.
310764_12_ITEM8_P108_S2	Under the $750 program announced in 2009, we repurchased 5.5 million shares at a total cost of $325 during 2011, which exhausted the authorization for repurchase under this program.
310764_12_ITEM8_P108_S3	We have 0.5 million authorized shares of $1 par value preferred stock, none of which is outstanding.
310764_12_ITEM8_P109_S0	Stock Options We have employee stock award plans from which we grant stock options to certain key employees at an exercise price not less than the fair market value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant.
310764_12_ITEM8_P109_S1	The options are granted for periods of up to 10 years and become exercisable in varying installments.
310764_12_ITEM8_P109_S2	A summary of stock option activity follows:
310764_12_ITEM8_P110_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value, which represents the cumulative difference between the fair market value of the underlying common stock and the option exercise prices, of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $69 , $73 and $38 , respectively.
310764_12_ITEM8_P110_S1	Shares reserved for future compensation grants of Stryker common stock were 32 million at December 31, 2011 and 11 million at December 31, 2010.

310764_12_ITEM8_P111_S0	We grant RSUs to key employees under our employee stock award plans.
310764_12_ITEM8_P111_S1	The fair value of RSUs is determined based on the number of shares granted and the closing quoted price of our common stock on the day prior to the date of grant less anticipated dividends.
310764_12_ITEM8_P111_S2	RSUs generally vest in one-third increments over a three-year period and are settled in stock.
310764_12_ITEM8_P111_S3	In 2011, we implemented a performance stock program and granted PSUs under our 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan to senior level executives.
310764_12_ITEM8_P111_S4	Under this program, PSU's are earned over a three-year performance cycle and vest in March of the year following the end of that performance cycle.
310764_12_ITEM8_P111_S5	The number of PSUs that will ultimately be earned is based on our performance relative to pre-established goals during that three year performance cycle.
310764_12_ITEM8_P111_S6	The fair value of PSUs is determined based on the closing quoted price of our common stock on the day prior to the date of grant.
310764_12_ITEM8_P111_S7	A summary of RSU and PSU activity follows:
310764_12_ITEM8_P112_S0	As of December 31, 2011, there was $43 of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested RSUs; that cost is expected to be recognized as expense over the following 3.7 years (weighted-average period of 1.0 years).

310764_12_ITEM8_P112_S3	As of December 31, 2011, there was $5 of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested PSUs; that cost is expected to be recognized as expense over the following 2.0 years (weighted-average period of 1.0 years).
310764_12_ITEM8_P113_S0	Employee Stock Purchase Plans (ESPP) Full time and part time employees may participate in our ESPP provided they meet certain eligibility requirements.
310764_12_ITEM8_P113_S1	The purchase price for our common stock under the terms of the ESPP is defined as 95% of the closing stock price on the last trading day of a purchase period.
310764_12_ITEM8_P113_S2	During 2011 and 2010, we issued 185,529 and 179,634 shares, respectively, under the ESPP.
310764_12_ITEM8_P114_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_12_ITEM8_P115_S0	In the fourth quarter of 2011 we recorded $38 in severance and related costs in connection with a focused reduction of our global workforce and other restructuring activities expected to reduce our global workforce by approximately 5% by the end of 2012.
310764_12_ITEM8_P115_S1	The targeted reductions and other restructuring activities are being initiated to provide efficiencies and realign resources in advance of the new Medical Device Excise Tax scheduled to begin in 2013, as well as to allow for continued investment in strategic areas and drive growth.
310764_12_ITEM8_P115_S2	In addition, we recorded $25 in intangible asset impairment, $6 in agent conversion and $7 in contractual and other obligations as certain of our restructuring actions resulted in the discontinued use of specific assets and the exit of certain lease and other commitments.
310764_12_ITEM8_P115_S3	In 2009 we recorded $30 related to agent conversion charges representing costs associated with the termination of certain third-party agent agreements at our Europe, Middle East, Africa (EMEA) Division.
310764_12_ITEM8_P116_S0	This initiative was intended to provide greater control over our distribution channels as well as improve customer focus and selling efficiency.
310764_12_ITEM8_P116_S1	In addition, we recorded $18 in asset impairment charges that relate primarily to identifiable intangible assets as a result of our decision to discontinue selling certain products within Reconstructive and MedSurg.
310764_12_ITEM8_P116_S2	Finally, we recorded $13 of severance and related costs in connection with workforce reduction employment-related severance costs for approximately 120 employees resulting from our decision to simplify the organization structure at our Biotech, EMEA, Japan and Canada divisions and $6 in contractual obligations and other charges in connection with the termination of various supplier contracts as well as other incidental costs related to the discontinued product lines.

310764_12_ITEM8_P117_S0	The restructuring projects initiated in 2009 are substantially complete, and we expect our 2011 restructuring actions to be complete by the end of 2012 and that related payments will be made by the end of the first quarter of 2013.
310764_12_ITEM8_P118_S0	NOTE 11 - INCOME TAXES Earnings before income taxes consisted of:
310764_12_ITEM8_P119_S0	In 2011 we recorded an income tax benefit related to a favorable settlement with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regarding its proposed adjustment to our previously filed 2003 through 2007 income tax returns related to income tax positions we had taken for our cost sharing arrangements with two wholly owned entities operating in Ireland, and we recorded charges for other uncertain tax positions related to the outcome of the IRS settlements.
310764_12_ITEM8_P119_S1	The net income tax benefit of these adjustments was $82 .
310764_12_ITEM8_P120_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_12_ITEM8_P121_S0	Reconciliation of the United States federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate:
310764_12_ITEM8_P122_S0	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities were comprised of:
310764_12_ITEM8_P123_S0	Net operating loss carryforwards totaling $251 at December 31, 2011 are available to reduce future taxable earnings of certain domestic and foreign subsidiaries.
310764_12_ITEM8_P123_S1	United States loss carryforwards of $116 expire between 2011 and 2019 .
310764_12_ITEM8_P123_S2	International loss carryforwards of $135 expire between 2011 and 2031 , and $102 are subject to a full valuation allowance.
310764_12_ITEM8_P124_S0	During 2009 we repatriated $787 of foreign earnings to the United States and recorded tax expense of $67 in 2009, a tax benefit of $7 in 2010 and a tax benefit of $7 in 2011 to recognize the tax liability and benefit associated with the repatriation.
310764_12_ITEM8_P124_S1	No provision has been made for United States federal and state income taxes or international income taxes that may result from future remittances of the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are determined to be indefinitely reinvested ( $5,646 at December 31, 2011).
310764_12_ITEM8_P124_S2	Determination of the amount of any unrecognized deferred income tax liability on these is not practicable.
310764_12_ITEM8_P124_S3	The changes in the amounts recorded for uncertain income tax positions are as follows:
310764_12_ITEM8_P125_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_12_ITEM8_P126_S0	Our income tax expense could be reduced by $235 and $347 at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, upon favorable resolution of these uncertain income tax positions.
310764_12_ITEM8_P126_S1	It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change due to one or more of the following events in the next twelve months: expiring statutes, audit activity, tax payments, competent authority proceedings related to transfer pricing, or final decisions in matters that are the subject of controversy in various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing, product royalty and foreign branch arrangements.
310764_12_ITEM8_P126_S2	We are not able to reasonably estimate the amount or the future periods in which changes in unrecognized tax benefits may be required.
310764_12_ITEM8_P127_S0	In the normal course of business, income tax authorities in various income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States conduct routine audits of our income tax returns filed in prior years.
310764_12_ITEM8_P127_S1	These audits are generally designed to determine if individual income tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretations of complex income tax regulations regarding the allocation of income to the various income tax jurisdictions.
310764_12_ITEM8_P127_S2	With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to audits by income tax authorities for tax years prior to 2006.
310764_12_ITEM8_P127_S3	Income tax years subsequent to 2005 are open to examination in many of the income tax jurisdictions in which we operate.
310764_12_ITEM8_P127_S4	In 2011 and 2010 we received income tax assessments related to an income tax position we had taken for the allocation of profits within Europe in previously filed 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 income tax returns.
310764_12_ITEM8_P127_S5	We believe we followed the applicable tax laws and regulations and will vigorously defend this income tax position.
310764_12_ITEM8_P127_S6	If we were to ultimately lose with respect to this income tax position it could have a material unfavorable impact on our income tax expense, results of operations and cash flows in future periods.
310764_12_ITEM8_P128_S0	NOTE 12 - RETIREMENT PLANS We provide certain employees with defined contribution plans.
310764_12_ITEM8_P128_S1	A portion of our retirement plan expense under the defined contribution plans is funded with Stryker common stock.
310764_12_ITEM8_P129_S0	The use of Stryker common stock represents a non cash operating activity that is not reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
310764_12_ITEM8_P130_S0	Certain of our subsidiaries have both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans covering some or all of their employees.
310764_12_ITEM8_P130_S1	Substantially all of the defined benefit pension plans have projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets.
310764_12_ITEM8_P131_S0	The estimated net actuarial loss for the defined benefit pension plans to be recognized from accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) into net periodic benefit cost in the year ended December 31, 2012 is ($3) .
310764_12_ITEM8_P131_S1	We estimate that an immaterial amount of amortization of prior service cost and transition amount for the defined benefit pension plans will be recognized from accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) into net periodic benefit cost in the year ended December 31, 2012.
310764_12_ITEM8_P132_S0	Pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets had projected benefit obligations, accumulated benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets of $298 , $292 and $195 , respectively, as of December 31, 2011 and $288 , $281 and $186 , respectively, as of December 31, 2010.
310764_12_ITEM8_P133_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_12_ITEM8_P134_S0	Discount rate The discount rates were selected using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds at December 31 that would provide the necessary cash flows to match our projected benefit payments.
310764_12_ITEM8_P135_S0	Expected return on plan assets The expected return on plan assets is determined by applying the target allocation in each asset category of plan investments to the anticipated return for each asset category based on historical and projected returns.
310764_12_ITEM8_P136_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_12_ITEM8_P137_S0	Investment strategy The investment strategy for our defined benefit pension plans is to meet the liabilities of the plans as they fall due and to maximize the return on invested assets within appropriate risk tolerances.
310764_12_ITEM8_P138_S0	The weighted-average target and actual allocation of plan assets by asset category is as follows:
310764_12_ITEM8_P139_S0	The valuation of our pension plan assets by pricing categories were:
310764_12_ITEM8_P140_S0	Our Level 3 pension plan assets (See Note 3 for an explanation of our fair value hierarchy) consist primarily of guaranteed investment contracts with insurance companies.
310764_12_ITEM8_P140_S1	The insurance contracts guarantee us principal repayment and a fixed rate of return.
310764_12_ITEM8_P140_S2	Our valuation of Level 3 assets is based on third party actuarial valuations that are an estimation of the surrender value of the guaranteed investment contract between us and the insurance company.
310764_12_ITEM8_P140_S3	The surrender value equals the actuarial value of the notional investments underlying the guaranteed investment contract, using the actuarial assumptions as stated in the guaranteed investment contract.
310764_12_ITEM8_P141_S0	The rollforward of pension plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs (Level 3) were:
310764_12_ITEM8_P142_S0	We expect to contribute $22 to our defined benefit pension plans in 2012.
310764_12_ITEM8_P142_S1	The estimated future benefit payments by year based on expected future service as appropriate are:
310764_12_ITEM8_P143_S0	In 2011 we began segregating our reporting into three reportable business segments: Reconstructive, MedSurg, and Neurotechnology and Spine.
310764_12_ITEM8_P143_S1	Prior to 2011, we segregated our operations into two reportable business segments: Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.
310764_12_ITEM8_P143_S2	In conjunction with the ongoing evolution of our business model, most notably the Neurovascular acquisition, we believe this change in our reportable business segments more accurately reflects the way management monitors performance, aligns strategies and allocates resources in the current environment.
310764_12_ITEM8_P144_S0	The Reconstructive segment includes orthopaedic reconstructive (hip and knee) and trauma implant systems as well as other related products.
310764_12_ITEM8_P144_S1	The MedSurg segment includes surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems (Instruments); endoscopic and communications systems (Endoscopy); patient handling and emergency medical equipment (Medical); and other related products.
310764_12_ITEM8_P144_S2	The Neurotechnology and Spine segment includes neurovascular products, spinal implant systems and other related products.
310764_12_ITEM8_P144_S3	The Other category shown in the table below includes corporate and global operations administration, central research and development initiatives, interest expense, interest and marketable securities income and share-based compensation, which includes compensation related to both employee and director stock option, restricted stock unit grants and performance stock unit grants.
310764_12_ITEM8_P145_S0	Our reportable segments are business units that offer different products and services and are managed separately because each business requires different manufacturing, technology and marketing strategies.
310764_12_ITEM8_P145_S1	The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

310764_12_ITEM8_P148_S0	Identifiable assets are those assets used exclusively in the operations of each business segment or allocated when used jointly.
310764_12_ITEM8_P148_S1	Corporate assets are principally cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and property, plant and equipment.
310764_12_ITEM8_P149_S0	The countries in which we have local revenue-generating operations have been combined into the following geographic areas: the United States (including Puerto Rico); Ireland; other European countries that primarily include Germany, France, Switzerland, United Kingdom; and other foreign countries, which include Japan, Canada, countries in the Pacific region and the Latin American region.

310764_12_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
310764_12_ITEM9A_P0_S2	There was no change to our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2011 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

310764_12_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
310764_12_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The internal controls over financial reporting of an acquired business are eligible for a one year exclusion as permitted by Securities and Exchange Commission Staff interpretive guidance.
310764_12_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Accordingly, management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the Neurovascular business, which is included in the December 31, 2011 consolidated financial statements of Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries and constitutes 13% and 7% of total assets and shareholders' equity, respectively, as of December 31, 2011 and 4% of revenues for the year then ended.

310764_12_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries' management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
310764_12_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
310764_12_ITEM9A_P6_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
310764_12_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
310764_12_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
310764_12_ITEM9A_P6_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
310764_12_ITEM9A_P7_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
310764_12_ITEM9A_P7_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
310764_12_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
310764_12_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
310764_12_ITEM9A_P9_S0	As indicated in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the Neurovascular business, which is included in the December 31, 2011 consolidated financial statements of Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries and constituted 13% and 7% of total assets and shareholders' equity, respectively, as of December 31, 2011 and 4% of revenues, for the year then ended.
310764_12_ITEM9A_P9_S1	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the Neurovascular business.
310764_12_ITEM9A_P10_S0	In our opinion, Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.

310764_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	In 2012 approximately 65.4% of our revenues were generated from customers in the United States.
310764_13_ITEM1_P26_S1	Internationally our products are sold in over 100 countries through local dealers and direct sales efforts.
310764_13_ITEM1_P26_S2	Additional geographic information is included under "Results of Operations" in Item 7 of this report and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.
310764_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	Raw materials essential to our business are generally readily available from multiple sources.
310764_13_ITEM1_P27_S1	Substantially all products we manufacture are stocked in inventory, while certain MedSurg products are assembled to order.
310764_13_ITEM1_P27_S2	A substantial amount of our neurovascular finished goods are currently sourced from Boston Scientific Corporation; the manufacture of these products will transfer to Stryker during 2013.
310764_13_ITEM1_P27_S3	The dollar amount of backlog orders at any given time is not considered to be significant.
310764_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	Patents and trademarks are significant to our business to the extent that a product or an attribute of a product represents a unique design or process.
310764_13_ITEM1_P28_S1	Patent protection of such products restricts competitors from duplicating these unique designs and features.
310764_13_ITEM1_P28_S2	We seek to obtain patent protection on our products whenever appropriate for protecting our competitive advantage.
310764_13_ITEM1_P28_S3	As of December 31, 2012, we own approximately 1,687 United States patents and 3,081 international patents.
310764_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	Our business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of reconstructive implant surgeries is generally lower during the summer months.
310764_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	In all of our product lines we compete with local and global companies located throughout the world.
310764_13_ITEM1_P30_S1	Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved.
310764_13_ITEM1_P30_S2	The development of new and innovative products is important to our success in all areas of our business and competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant.
310764_13_ITEM1_P30_S3	The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and in maintaining sales forces.
310764_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	The principal factors that we believe differentiate us in the highly competitive product categories in which we operate and enable us to compete effectively include our commitment to innovation and quality, service and reputation.
310764_13_ITEM1_P31_S1	We believe that our competitive position in the future will depend to a large degree on our ability to develop new products and make improvements to existing products.
310764_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	We also invest through acquisitions in technologies developed by third parties that have the potential to expand the markets in which we operate.
310764_13_ITEM1_P32_S1	We maintain close working relationships with physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist us in product development efforts.
310764_13_ITEM1_P32_S2	The total costs of worldwide Company-sponsored research, development and engineering activities relating to the development of new products, improvement of existing products, technical support of products and compliance with governmental regulations for the protection of customers and patients were $471 , $462 and $394 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
310764_13_ITEM1_P32_S3	Research, development and engineering expenses as a percentage of sales were 5.4% , 5.6% and 5.4% in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
310764_13_ITEM1_P32_S4	The spending level in 2012 as a percentage of sales decreased primarily due to the termination of all development of the OP-1 molecule in late 2011.
310764_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	Our businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation.
310764_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	In the United States, the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its subsequent amendments, and the regulations issued or proposed thereunder, provide for regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices, including most of our products.
310764_13_ITEM1_P34_S1	Many of our new products fall into FDA classifications that require notification of and review by the FDA before marketing, submitted as a 510(k).
310764_13_ITEM1_P34_S2	Certain of our products require extensive clinical testing, consisting of safety and efficacy studies, followed by pre-market approval (PMA) applications for specific surgical indications.
310764_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	The FDA's Quality System regulations set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the FDA.
310764_13_ITEM1_P35_S1	There are also certain requirements of state, local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the manufacture and marketing of our products.
310764_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	The member states of the European Union (EU) have adopted the European Medical Device Directives that form a single set of medical device regulations for all EU member countries.
310764_13_ITEM1_P36_S1	These regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member countries to meet certain quality system requirements and obtain CE Marking for their products.
310764_13_ITEM1_P36_S2	We have authorization to apply the CE Marking to substantially all of our products.
310764_13_ITEM1_P36_S3	In addition, we comply with the unique regulatory requirements of each of the countries in which we market our products.
310764_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	Initiatives sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare expenses generally and hospital costs in particular, including price regulation and competitive pricing, are ongoing in markets where we do business.
310764_13_ITEM1_P37_S1	It is not possible to predict at this time the long-term impact of such cost containment measures on our future business.
310764_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	In addition, business practices in the healthcare industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the United States, by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.
310764_13_ITEM1_P39_S0	At December 31, 2012, we had approximately 22,010 employees worldwide.
310764_13_ITEM1_P40_S0	Certain international employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
310764_13_ITEM1_P41_S0	We believe that we maintain positive relationships with our employees worldwide.
310764_13_ITEM1_P42_S0	Information regarding our executive officers appears under the caption "Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance" in Item 10 of this Report.
310764_13_ITEM1_P43_S0	Our main corporate website address is www.stryker.com.
310764_13_ITEM1_P43_S1	Copies of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Current Reports on Form 8-K filed or furnished to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will be provided without charge to any shareholder submitting a written request to our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices.
310764_13_ITEM1_P43_S2	All of our SEC filings are also available free of charge on our website within the "Investor-SEC Filings Ownership Reports" link as soon as reasonably practicable after having been electronically filed or furnished to the SEC.
310764_13_ITEM1_P43_S3	All SEC filings are also available at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov .
310764_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	This report contains statements referring to us that are not historical facts and are considered "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These statements, which are intended to take advantage of the "safe harbor" provisions of the Reform Act, are based on current projections about operations, industry conditions, financial condition and liquidity.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Words that identify forward-looking statements include words such as "may," "could," "will," "should," "possible," "plan," "predict," "forecast," "potential," "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "believe," "may impact," "on track," and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance, an acquisition or our businesses.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P0_S3	In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Those statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P0_S5	Therefore, actual results could differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P0_S6	Some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forward-looking statements include those risks discussed below.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The impact of United States healthcare reform legislation on us remains uncertain.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	In 2010 federal legislation to reform the United States healthcare system was enacted into law.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	The law was upheld by a Supreme Court decision that was announced on June 28, 2012.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The legislation is far-reaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage, improve quality and reduce costs over time.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We expect the new law will have a significant impact upon various aspects of our business operations.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Among other things, the new law imposes a 2.3 percent excise tax on Class I, II and III medical devices beginning January 2013 that will apply to United States sales of a majority of our medical device products.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Other provisions of this legislation, including Medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs, comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies, could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Further, we cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will be ultimately implemented at the federal or state level, the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the United States or internationally or whether any changes will lower reimbursements for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Cost containment measures in the United States and other countries resulting in pricing pressures could have a negative impact on our future operating results.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Initiatives sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation and competitive pricing, are ongoing in markets where we do business.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Pricing pressure has also increased in our markets due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers, trends toward managed care, the shift towards governments becoming the primary payers of healthcare expenses, and government laws and regulations relating to reimbursement and pricing generally.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Reductions in reimbursement levels or coverage or other cost containment measures could unfavorably affect our future operating results.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We may be adversely affected by product liability claims, unfavorable court decisions or legal settlements.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We are defendants in various proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including product liability and other matters.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	These matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P6_S3	In addition, we may incur significant legal expenses regardless of whether we are found to be liable.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P6_S4	To partially mitigate losses arising from unfavorable outcomes in such matters, we purchase third-party insurance coverage subject to certain retentions, deductibles and loss limitations.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P6_S5	We may be adversely impacted by any settlement payments or losses beyond the amounts of insurance carried or for which coverage is otherwise not available.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P6_S6	In addition, even if covered by insurance, such losses may negatively impact our ability to obtain third-party insurance coverage in future periods on a cost effective basis or at all.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Intellectual property litigation and infringement claims could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling certain of our products.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The medical device industry is characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation and, from time to time, we are the subject of claims by third parties of potential infringement or misappropriation.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Regardless of outcome, such claims are expensive to defend and divert the time and effort of our management and operating personnel from other business issues.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	A successful claim or claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments or negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products in the affected category.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Dependence on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to such rights may impact offerings in our product portfolios.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our long-term success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If we fail to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property protection, we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies or may lose access to technologies critical to our products.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Also, our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents, and issued patents are subject to claims concerning priority, scope and other issues.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to the manufacturing, labeling and marketing of our products.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Substantially all of our products are subject to regulation by the FDA and other governmental authorities in the United States and internationally.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P11_S2	The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products timely, if at all.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P11_S3	In addition, if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to a range of sanctions including warning letters, monetary fines, product recalls and the suspension of product manufacturing and criminal prosecution.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Macroeconomic developments, such as the recent recessions in Europe and the debt crises in certain countries in the European Union, could negatively affect our ability to conduct business in those geographies.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The continuing debt crises in certain European Union countries could cause the value of the euro to deteriorate, reducing the purchasing power of our European Union customers.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers and customers, including distributors, could result in product delays and inventory issues; risks to accounts receivable could also include delays in collection and greater bad debt expense.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross border transactions and translation of local currency results into United States dollars.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Cross border transactions, both with external parties and intercompany relationships, result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	In addition, our sales are translated into United States dollars for reporting purposes.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P13_S3	The strengthening or weakening of the United States dollar could result in favorable or unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into United States dollars.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We may be unable to effectively develop and market products against the products of our competitors in a highly competitive industry.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by our competitors.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Competitive factors include price, customer service, technology, innovation, quality, reputation and reliability.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Our competition may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us or may be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees and strategic partners.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Given these factors, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue our level of success in the industry.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Competition in research, involving the development and improvement of new and existing products, is particularly significant and results from time to time in product obsolescence.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Such marketplace changes may cause some of our products to become obsolete.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P15_S3	If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, a higher level of inventory write downs may result.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We may be unable to maintain adequate working relationships with healthcare professionals.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We seek to maintain close working relationships with respected physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist in product research and development.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We rely on these professionals to assist us in the development of proprietary products and product improvements to complement and expand our existing product lines.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P16_S3	If we are unable to maintain these relationships, our ability to develop, market and sell new and improved products could decrease.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We are subject to additional risks associated with our extensive international operations.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	We develop, manufacture and distribute our products throughout the world.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Our international operations are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of additional risks and potential costs, including changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs, unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements, differing local product preferences and product requirements, diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the United States, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, extraterritorial effects of United States laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations and political and economic instability.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We may be unable to capitalize on previous or future acquisitions.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	In addition to internally developed products, we rely upon investment in new technologies through acquisitions.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Investments in medical technology are inherently risky, and we cannot guarantee that any acquisition will be successful or will not have a material unfavorable impact on us.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P18_S3	These risks include the activities required by us to integrate new businesses, which may result in the need to allocate more resources to integration and product development activities than originally anticipated, diversion of management's time, which could adversely affect management's ability to focus on other projects, the inability to realize the expected benefits, savings or synergies from the acquisition, the loss of key personnel of the acquired company, and exposure to unexpected liabilities of the acquired company.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P18_S4	In addition, we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so, which may result in unexpected impairment charges.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We may record future goodwill impairment charges related to one or more of our business units, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P19_S2	In evaluating the potential for impairment we make assumptions regarding revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows, tax rates, and discount rates.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P19_S3	These assumptions are uncertain and by nature may vary from actual results.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P19_S4	A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our results of operations.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our results of operations could be negatively impacted by future changes in the allocation of income to each of the income tax jurisdictions in which we operate.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both in the United States and internationally.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Accordingly, our management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each jurisdiction based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Income tax authorities regularly perform audits of our income tax filings.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Income tax audits associated with the allocation of income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing, product royalty and foreign branch arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P21_S4	If changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates, the related adjustments could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Failure of a key information technology system, process or site could have a material adverse impact on our business.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We rely extensively on information technology systems to conduct business.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	These systems include, but are not limited to, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping products to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, providing data security and other processes necessary to manage our business.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P23_S2	If our systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively compensate timely, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We may be unable to attract and retain key employees .
310764_13_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Our sales, technical and other key personnel play an integral role in the development, marketing and selling of new and existing products.
310764_13_ITEM1A_P24_S2	If we are unable to recruit, hire, develop and retain a talented, competitive work force, we may not be able to meet our strategic business objectives.
310764_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	The following are our principal manufacturing locations as of December 31, 2012:
310764_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	In addition, we maintain corporate, administrative and sales offices and warehousing and distribution facilities in multiple countries.
310764_13_ITEM2_P1_S1	We believe that our properties are suitable and adequate for the manufacture and distribution of our products.
310764_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are involved in various proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property, and other matters that are more fully described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report; this information is incorporated herein by reference.

310764_13_ITEM5_P0_S1	Quarterly stock price and dividend information for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were as follows:
310764_13_ITEM5_P1_S0	Our Board of Directors considers payment of cash dividends at each of its quarterly meetings.
310764_13_ITEM5_P1_S1	On January 31, 2013, there were 4,236 shareholders of record of our common stock.
310764_13_ITEM5_P2_S0	In December 2012, 2011 and 2010, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized us to purchase up to $405 , $500 and $500 , respectively, of our common stock (the 2012, 2011 and 2010 Repurchase Programs, respectively).
310764_13_ITEM5_P2_S1	Purchases are to be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.
310764_13_ITEM5_P2_S2	Under the 2010 Repurchase Program, we repurchased 2.1 million shares at a cost of $108 during 2012.
310764_13_ITEM5_P2_S3	We had not made any repurchases pursuant to the 2012 or 2011 Repurchase Programs at December 31, 2012 .
310764_13_ITEM5_P2_S4	At December 31, 2012 , the maximum dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the the authorized Repurchase Programs was $1,000 .
310764_13_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following graph compares our total returns (including reinvestments of dividends) against the Standard Poor s (S P) 500 Composite Stock Price Index and the S P Health Care (Medical Products and Supplies) Index.
310764_13_ITEM5_P3_S1	The graph assumes $100 (not in millions) invested on December 31, 2007 in our Common Stock and each of the indices.
310764_13_ITEM6_P0_S0	Selected financial data for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 2012 is as follows:
310764_13_ITEM6_P1_S0	(a) Includes restructuring and asset impairment charges.
310764_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including percentage sales growth in constant currency, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share.
310764_13_ITEM7_P0_S1	We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance.
310764_13_ITEM7_P0_S2	Management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency, adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses.
310764_13_ITEM7_P0_S3	Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these non-GAAP financial measures.
310764_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales.
310764_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	Percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates.
310764_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	To measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings.
310764_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names.
310764_13_ITEM7_P2_S2	These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth, net earnings and diluted net earnings per share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
310764_13_ITEM7_P2_S3	These non-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures at the end of the discussion of Results of Operations below, provide a more complete understanding of our business.
310764_13_ITEM7_P2_S4	We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

310764_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	Recent Business Developments In February 2013 we made a voluntary general offer to acquire all the shares of Trauson Holdings Company Limited for HK$7.50 per ordinary share for a total consideration of $764 in an all cash transaction.
310764_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	With this acquisition, which is expected to close before the end of the second quarter of 2013, we will expand our presence in a key emerging market with a product portfolio and pipeline that is targeted at the large and fast growing value segment of the Chinese orthopaedic market.
310764_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	In December 2012 we recorded a charge of $174 ($133 net of taxes), or approximately $0.35 per share, related to the previously disclosed voluntary recall of our Rejuvenate and ABG II modular-neck hip stems.

310764_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	In 2012 we recorded $40 in severance and related costs in connection with focused reductions of our global workforce and other restructuring activities that are expected to reduce our global workforce by approximately 5%.
310764_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	The targeted reductions and other restructuring activities were initiated to provide efficiencies and realign resources in advance of the Medical Device Excise Tax, as well as to allow for continued investment in strategic areas and drive growth.
310764_13_ITEM7_P10_S2	In addition, we recorded $7 in intangible asset impairments, $3 in agent conversion and $25 in contractual and other obligations, as certain of our restructuring actions resulted in the discontinued use of specific assets and the exit of certain lease and other commitments.
310764_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our consolidated results of operations were:
310764_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	Our geographic and segment net sales were:
310764_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	Net sales increased 4.2% in 2012 after increasing 13.5% in 2011.
310764_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	In 2012 net sales grew by 5.6% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix and 1.2% due to acquisitions, and were negatively impacted by 1.4% due to changes in price and 1.2% due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales.
310764_13_ITEM7_P13_S2	In constant currency, net sales in 2012 increased by 5.4% .
310764_13_ITEM7_P13_S3	In 2011 net sales grew by 6.1% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix, 2.4% due to the favorable impact of foreign currency and 6.8% due to acquisitions, and were negatively impacted by 1.8% due to changes in price.
310764_13_ITEM7_P13_S4	In constant currency, net sales in 2011 increased by 11.1%.
310764_13_ITEM7_P13_S5	The increase in consolidated net sales for 2012 was primarily due to higher shipments of Neurotechnology, Instruments, Trauma and Extremities, Spine and reprocessed and remanufactured medical devices; these gains were partially offset by slowness in the European markets.
310764_13_ITEM7_P13_S6	The increase in consolidated net sales for 2011 was primarily due to sales growth through acquisitions, higher United States shipments of MedSurg products and higher international shipments of MedSurg products and Neurotechnology and Spine products.
310764_13_ITEM7_P13_S7	In the United States net sales increased 7.4% in 2012 after increasing 9.9% in 2011.

310764_13_ITEM7_P16_S3	The increase in units sold was due to higher industry demand.
310764_13_ITEM7_P16_S4	In addition, net sales were negatively impacted by 2.8% due to changes in price.
310764_13_ITEM7_P16_S5	In constant currency, Reconstructive net sales increased by 1.5% in 2011.
310764_13_ITEM7_P16_S6	MedSurg net sales in 2012 increased 3.3% from 2011, primarily due to a 4.1% increase in unit volume and changes in product mix and 0.1% due to acquisitions, and were negatively impacted by 0.1% due to changes in price and 0.9% due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales.
310764_13_ITEM7_P16_S7	In constant currency, MedSurg net sales in 2012 increased 4.2% , led by higher shipments of Instruments and reprocessed and remanufactured medical devices; these higher shipments were partially offset by challenging global market conditions for capital equipment.
310764_13_ITEM7_P16_S8	MedSurg net sales in 2011 increased 12.7% from 2010, led by Medical while Endoscopy and Instruments also increased, primarily due to a 9.5% increase in unit volume and changes in product mix, 1.6% due to the favorable impact of foreign currency and 1.9% due to acquisitions.
310764_13_ITEM7_P16_S9	The effect of pricing on net sales was not significant.
310764_13_ITEM7_P16_S10	In constant currency MedSurg net sales increased by 11.2% in 2011.
310764_13_ITEM7_P16_S11	Neurotechnology and Spine net sales in 2012 increased 9.2% from 2011, primarily due to an 8.5% increase in unit volume and changes in product mix and 4.2% due to acquisitions, and were negatively impacted by 2.2% due to changes in price and 1.3% due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales.

310764_13_ITEM7_P16_S13	Neurotechnology and Spine net sales in 2011 increased 48.5% from 2010, primarily due to the acquisition of Neurovascular.
310764_13_ITEM7_P16_S14	Sales growth from acquisitions was 42.6%.
310764_13_ITEM7_P16_S15	The remainder of the increase included 6.3% due to increases in unit volume and changes in product mix and 2.0% due to the favorable impact of foreign currency, and the negative impact of changes in price of 2.5%.
310764_13_ITEM7_P16_S16	In constant currency, Neurotechnology and Spine net sales in 2011 increased by 46.4%.
310764_13_ITEM7_P16_S17	Consolidated Cost of Sales Cost of sales decreased 1.1% from 2011 to 32.1% of sales compared to 33.8% in 2011.
310764_13_ITEM7_P16_S18	Cost of sales in 2012 and 2011 includes an additional cost of $18 and $143, respectively, related to inventory that was "stepped up" to fair value following acquisitions.
310764_13_ITEM7_P16_S19	Cost of sales for 2012 also included $5 in other restructuring related costs.
310764_13_ITEM7_P16_S20	Aside from these factors, the decrease in the cost of sales percentage in 2012 was primarily due to efficiencies in our manufacturing and distribution network, a favorable product mix and a favorable impact from the effect of foreign currency on costs from our euro-based manufacturing operations.
310764_13_ITEM7_P16_S21	Cost of sales in 2011 increased 23.0% from 2010 to 33.8% of sales compared to 31.2% in 2010.
310764_13_ITEM7_P16_S22	The increase in the cost of sales percentage in 2011 was primarily due to the impact of inventory "step up" and lower pricing on sales resulting in an increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales, the impact of changes in product mix and of a weaker United States dollar on purchases from international manufacturing operations.
310764_13_ITEM7_P16_S23	Research, Development and Engineering Expenses Research, development and engineering expenses represented 5.4% of sales compared to 5.6% in 2011 and 5.4% in 2010.
310764_13_ITEM7_P16_S24	The spending level in 2012 decreased as a percentage of sales primarily due to the termination of all development of the OP-1 molecule in late 2011.
310764_13_ITEM7_P16_S25	The higher spending level in 2011 compared to 2010 was the result of our focus on new product development for anticipated future product launches and continued investments in new technologies.
310764_13_ITEM7_P16_S26	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10.0% and represented 40.0% of sales compared to 37.9% in 2011 and 37.0% in 2010.

310764_13_ITEM7_P16_S29	In 2011 general and administrative expenses included the payment of an intellectual property infringement claim, offset by a favorable resolution of a value added tax issue.
310764_13_ITEM7_P16_S30	In 2010 we sold a manufacturing facility in France and recorded a gain of $24 that is included in general and administrative expenses.
310764_13_ITEM7_P16_S31	In 2012 and 2011 we recorded $75 and $76 , respectively, in restructuring charges related to focused reductions of our global workforce and other restructuring, expected to reduce our global workforce by approximately 5% and be complete by the end of 2013 at a total cost of approximately $225.
310764_13_ITEM7_P16_S32	The targeted reductions and other restructuring activities were initiated to provide efficiencies and realign resources in advance of the Medical Device Excise Tax, as well as to allow for continued investment in strategic areas and drive growth.
310764_13_ITEM7_P16_S33	Other Income (Expense) Other expense in 2012 increased $36 from 2011 after decreasing $22 from 2010.
310764_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	reached with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
310764_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	In 2011 we reached a favorable settlement regarding an IRS proposed adjustment to our previously filed 2003 through 2007 income tax returns related to the income tax positions we had taken for our Irish cost sharing arrangements.
310764_13_ITEM7_P17_S2	We also reached a settlement with the IRS with respect to the allocation of income with a wholly owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico for the years 2006 through 2009.
310764_13_ITEM7_P17_S3	The higher interest expense in 2012 due to the effect of the 2011 tax settlements was partially offset by higher interest income on our investments, due to higher cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances compared to 2011.
310764_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate on earnings was 23.9% , 20.2% and 26.4% in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
310764_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	The effective income tax rate for 2012 includes the net impact of effective settlement of all tax matters through 2004 relating to two German subsidiaries, and adjustment of the estimate of foreign tax credits to the amount shown on the tax return as filed.

310764_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the Act) was signed on January 2, 2013.
310764_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	The Act provided numerous tax provisions for corporations including an extension of the research tax credit and an extension of certain provisions for companies with significant international operations.
310764_13_ITEM7_P19_S2	These provisions originally expired at December 31, 2011 but were retroactively extended through December 31, 2013.
310764_13_ITEM7_P19_S3	In 2013 we will record tax benefits of approximately $13 related to the 2012 research tax credit and other provisions of the Act.

310764_13_ITEM7_P20_S4	Reported net earnings includes the benefits from settlements and other adjustments related to uncertain tax positions, restructuring and related charges and acquisition and integration related charges, including transaction costs, integration related costs and additional cost of sales for inventory sold in the year that was "stepped up" to fair value.
310764_13_ITEM7_P20_S5	In addition, 2012 net earnings includes a charge of $133 (net of taxes) related to the previously disclosed voluntary recall of our Rejuvenate and ABG II modular-neck hip stems, and $33 offered to the United States Department of Justice to resolve the matter related to the sales and marketing of our OtisKnee device for which we have recorded a corresponding non-tax deductible charge.
310764_13_ITEM7_P20_S6	Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted net earnings in 2012 increased 7.7% to $1,560 after increasing 9.0% in 2011.
310764_13_ITEM7_P20_S7	Adjusted diluted net earnings per share in 2012 increased 9.4% to $4.07 after increasing 11.7% in 2011.
310764_13_ITEM7_P20_S8	The following reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, reported net earnings and diluted net earnings per share:
310764_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	The weighted-average basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures are the same as the weighted-average shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported per share amounts.
310764_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Operating Activities Operating cash flow was $1,657 in 2012, an increase of 15.6% from 2011.
310764_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	Operating cash flow resulted primarily from net earnings adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, sale of inventory "stepped up" to fair value at acquisition and deferred income taxes).
310764_13_ITEM7_P22_S2	The net of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable consumed $50 of operating cash flow in 2012.
310764_13_ITEM7_P22_S3	Inventory contributed $18 of operating cash flow as inventory days on hand decreased by 5 days due to lower inventory levels driven primarily by improved inventory management.
310764_13_ITEM7_P22_S4	Accounts receivable used $20 primarily to support business growth, while accounts receivable days sales outstanding decreased by 3 days due to timing of sales.
310764_13_ITEM7_P22_S5	Operating cash flow was $1,434 in 2011, a decrease of 7.3% from 2010.
310764_13_ITEM7_P22_S6	Operating cash flow resulted primarily from net earnings adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, sale of inventory "stepped up" to fair value at acquisition and deferred income taxes).
310764_13_ITEM7_P22_S7	The net of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable consumed $274 of operating cash flow in 2011.
310764_13_ITEM7_P22_S8	Inventory consumed $166 of operating cash flow primarily due to the building of inventory related to acquisitions and other business growth, increased stock levels in advance of new product introductions and higher inventory levels in support of anticipated 2012 sales growth.
310764_13_ITEM7_P22_S9	Inventory days on hand increased by 4 days due to the impact of the above.
310764_13_ITEM7_P22_S10	Accounts receivable used $143, primarily due to the building of accounts receivable related to acquisitions and other business growth.
310764_13_ITEM7_P22_S11	Accounts receivable days sales outstanding increased by 2 days due to timing of sales.
310764_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	Investing Activities Net investing activities consumed $736 of cash in 2012 and $2,135 in 2011, primarily due to acquisitions and capital spending.
310764_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	Acquisitions used $154 of cash in 2012 and $2,066 in 2011.
310764_13_ITEM7_P23_S2	Cash used in 2012 was primarily for the acquisition of Surpass Medical for $99 as well as for milestone payments associated with previous acquisitions.
310764_13_ITEM7_P23_S3	Cash used in 2011 was primarily for the acquisitions of Neurovascular for $1,450; Orthovita for $316; Memometal for $150; and Concentric for $135.
310764_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	We manage capital spending to support our business growth.
310764_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	Capital expenditures, primarily to support integration of acquisitions, capacity expansion, new product introductions, innovation and cost savings, were $210 in 2012 and $226 in 2011.
310764_13_ITEM7_P24_S2	Proceeds from asset sales contributed $67 to cash in 2011, primarily due to the sale of certain assets related to the OP-1 product family.
310764_13_ITEM7_P24_S3	Dividends paid per common share increased 18.1% to $0.85 per share in 2012.
310764_13_ITEM7_P24_S4	Total dividend payments to common shareholders were $324 in 2012 and $279 in 2011.
310764_13_ITEM7_P24_S5	The increase in dividend payments resulted from increases in our quarterly dividend from $0.18 per share in 2011 to $0.2125 per share in 2012.
310764_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and overall cost of capital.
310764_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	In September 2011 we sold $750 of unsecured notes due September 2016.
310764_13_ITEM7_P25_S2	The net proceeds from the offerings have been and will continue to be available for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, stock repurchases and other business opportunities.
310764_13_ITEM7_P25_S3	Total debt was $1,762 in 2012 and $1,768 in 2011.
310764_13_ITEM7_P25_S4	The total use of cash for share repurchases was $108 in 2012 and $622 in 2011.
310764_13_ITEM7_P25_S5	Liquidity Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $4,285 at December 31, 2012 and $3,418 at December 31, 2011 and our current assets exceeded current liabilities by $6,272 at December 31, 2012 and $5,367 at December 31, 2011.
310764_13_ITEM7_P25_S6	We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations.
310764_13_ITEM7_P25_S7	We have also raised funds in the past in the capital markets and may continue to do so from time to time.
310764_13_ITEM7_P25_S8	We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due.
310764_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	In August 2012 we refinanced our credit facility with a new $1,000 Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility due August 2017 (2012 Facility).
310764_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	The 2012 Facility replaced the previously outstanding $1,000 Unsecured Credit Facility that would have become due in August 2013.
310764_13_ITEM7_P26_S2	The 2012 Facility includes an increase option permitting us to increase the size of the facility up to an additional $500, a $500 multicurrency sublimit (with no sublimit for euro borrowings) and a $100 letter of credit sublimit.
310764_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	annual facility fee ranging from 5 to 22.5 basis points and bears interest at LIBOR, as defined in the 2012 Facility agreement, plus an applicable margin ranging from 57.5 to 127.5 basis points, both of which are dependent on our credit ratings.
310764_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	Should additional funds be required we had approximately $1,063 of borrowing capacity available under all of our existing credit facilities at December 31, 2012 , including the 2012 Facility.
310764_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	In February of 2013 we made a voluntary general offer to acquire Trauson Holdings Company Limited, a leading manufacturer of trauma and spine products in China.
310764_13_ITEM7_P29_S1	In connection with this offer, we have restricted $800 of our available borrowing capacity until the completion of the tender offer.
310764_13_ITEM7_P29_S2	The transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2013.
310764_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	At December 31, 2012 , approximately 60% of our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held outside of the United States.
310764_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	These funds are considered indefinitely reinvested to be used to expand operations either organically or through acquisitions outside the United States.
310764_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	Several European countries, including Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece (the Southern European Region), have been subject to credit deterioration due to weaknesses in their economic and fiscal conditions.
310764_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	We continuously monitor our investment portfolio for exposures to the European debt crisis.
310764_13_ITEM7_P31_S2	We currently do not have any investments in the sovereign debt instruments of the Southern European Region.
310764_13_ITEM7_P31_S3	Any non-sovereign exposure in these countries in our investment portfolio is considered immaterial.
310764_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	We continually evaluate our receivables, particularly in the Southern European Region.
310764_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	The total net receivables from the Southern European Region were approximately $198 and $257 at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, including approximately $103 and $170, respectively, of sovereign receivables.
310764_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	We believe that our current reserves related to receivables are adequate and any additional credit risk associated with the European debt crisis is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial position or liquidity.
310764_13_ITEM7_P33_S1	We do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.
310764_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND FORWARD-LOOKING CASH REQUIREMENTS As further described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2012 our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by $193 , of which approximately $183 related to plans outside the United States.
310764_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	Due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions in the jurisdictions the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and the potential for changes in legislation in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods, beyond 2013, in which contributions to fund defined benefit pension plans will be made.
310764_13_ITEM7_P34_S2	As further described in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2012 we have recorded a liability for uncertain income tax positions of $227 .
310764_13_ITEM7_P34_S3	Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits, we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made.
310764_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	Our future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than one year, including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business, are:
310764_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	In preparing our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application.
310764_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	These include allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, income taxes, acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets, and legal and other contingencies.
310764_13_ITEM7_P36_S2	We believe these accounting policies and the others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition.
310764_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable.
310764_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	We make estimates regarding the future ability of our customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends.
310764_13_ITEM7_P37_S2	If actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.
310764_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	We maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs.
310764_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	We make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends.
310764_13_ITEM7_P38_S2	If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.
310764_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	Our annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes.
310764_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are recorded in the financial statements.
310764_13_ITEM7_P40_S1	Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense.
310764_13_ITEM7_P40_S2	These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
310764_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our financial statements.
310764_13_ITEM7_P41_S1	Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred, the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction has already been taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment.
310764_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes.
310764_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	Realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods.
310764_13_ITEM7_P43_S1	Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.
310764_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments.
310764_13_ITEM7_P44_S1	In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority.
310764_13_ITEM7_P44_S2	These differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment.
310764_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes.
310764_13_ITEM7_P45_S1	We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly.
310764_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions.
310764_13_ITEM7_P46_S1	Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
310764_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	Because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events, such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans, could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate.
310764_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	We account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting.
310764_13_ITEM7_P48_S1	Under the purchase method, our financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition.
310764_13_ITEM7_P48_S2	In addition, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill.
310764_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives.
310764_13_ITEM7_P49_S1	Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant items.
310764_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain.
310764_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets.
310764_13_ITEM7_P51_S1	Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.
310764_13_ITEM7_P51_S2	Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.
310764_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment.
310764_13_ITEM7_P52_S1	The majority of our acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives.
310764_13_ITEM7_P52_S2	Our assessment as to the useful lives of these intangible assets is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, trademark and/or brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarks or brands are sold.
310764_13_ITEM7_P52_S3	Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors.
310764_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life.
310764_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	In certain of our acquisitions, we acquire in-process research and development (IPRD) intangible assets.
310764_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	IPRD is considered to be an indefinite-lived intangible asset until such time as the research is completed (at which time it becomes a determinable-lived intangible asset) or determined to have no future use (at which time it is impaired).
310764_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment.
310764_13_ITEM7_P55_S1	Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles.
310764_13_ITEM7_P55_S2	We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year.
310764_13_ITEM7_P55_S3	We have adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-08, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other: Testing Goodwill for Impairment , which permits us to consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill.
310764_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	In certain circumstances, we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability.
310764_13_ITEM7_P56_S1	In those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level.
310764_13_ITEM7_P56_S2	We test individual indefinite-lived intangibles by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value.
310764_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	We determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the income approach.
310764_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows.
310764_13_ITEM7_P58_S1	Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value.
310764_13_ITEM7_P58_S2	Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans.
310764_13_ITEM7_P58_S3	We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants.
310764_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	We did not recognize any material impairment charges for goodwill during the years presented, as our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill fair values exceeded their respective recorded values.
310764_13_ITEM7_P59_S1	Future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values.
310764_13_ITEM7_P59_S2	A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our financial statements.
310764_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	We review long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
310764_13_ITEM7_P60_S1	The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level.
310764_13_ITEM7_P60_S2	The undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections.
310764_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique.
310764_13_ITEM7_P61_S1	Assets classified as held for sale, if any, are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
310764_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	We are involved in various ongoing proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property, and other matters that are more fully described in "Other Information" below and in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_13_ITEM7_P62_S1	The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time.
310764_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	equitable relief, that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief.
310764_13_ITEM7_P63_S1	For legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management's best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded.
310764_13_ITEM7_P63_S2	The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies.
310764_13_ITEM7_P63_S3	If actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.
310764_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	To partially mitigate losses arising from unfavorable outcomes in such matters, we purchase third-party insurance coverage subject to certain deductibles and loss limitations.
310764_13_ITEM7_P64_S1	Future operating results may be unfavorably impacted by any settlement payments or losses beyond the amounts of insurance carried.
310764_13_ITEM7_P64_S2	In addition, such matters may negatively impact our ability to obtain cost effective third-party insurance coverage in future periods.
310764_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS No accounting pronouncements that were issued or became effective during the year have had or are expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_13_ITEM7_P65_S1	For a discussion of new accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_13_ITEM7_P65_S2	OTHER INFORMATION Hedging and Derivative Financial Instruments We sell our products throughout the world.
310764_13_ITEM7_P65_S3	As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak economic conditions or changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
310764_13_ITEM7_P65_S4	Our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the United States dollar, European currencies, in particular the euro, Swiss franc and the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar.
310764_13_ITEM7_P65_S5	We develop and manufacture products in the United States, China, France, Germany, Ireland, Puerto Rico and Switzerland and incur costs in the applicable local currencies.
310764_13_ITEM7_P65_S6	This worldwide deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on our cost of sales.
310764_13_ITEM7_P65_S7	We enter into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates.
310764_13_ITEM7_P65_S8	These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products.
310764_13_ITEM7_P65_S9	The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies.
310764_13_ITEM7_P65_S10	All forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period, with resulting gains (losses) included in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
310764_13_ITEM7_P65_S11	The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points.
310764_13_ITEM7_P65_S12	A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar would change the December 31, 2012 fair value by approximately $10.
310764_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	We are exposed to credit loss in the event of non performance by counterparties on our outstanding forward currency exchange contracts, but we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our counterparties.
310764_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	We have certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged.
310764_13_ITEM7_P67_S1	These investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
310764_13_ITEM7_P67_S2	For 2012 the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar increased the value of these investments in net assets and the related foreign currency translation adjustment gain in shareholders' equity by $50 , to $226 from $176 as of December 31, 2011.
310764_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	Legal and Regulatory Matters On June 28, 2012 we voluntarily recalled our Rejuvenate and ABG II modular-neck hip stems and terminated global distribution of these hip products.
310764_13_ITEM7_P68_S1	We notified healthcare professionals and regulatory bodies of this recall, which was taken due to potential risks associated with fretting and/or corrosion that may lead to adverse local tissue reactions.
310764_13_ITEM7_P68_S2	Product liability lawsuits relating to this voluntary recall have been filed against us.
310764_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	As previously announced, we intend to reimburse implanted patients for reasonable and customary costs of testing and treatment services, including any necessary revision surgeries.
310764_13_ITEM7_P69_S1	We continue to work with the medical community to evaluate the data and further understand this matter and the associated costs.
310764_13_ITEM7_P69_S2	The ultimate total cost with respect to this matter will depend on many factors that are difficult to predict with the limited information received to date and may vary materially based on the number of and actual costs of patients seeking testing and treatment services, the number of and actual costs of patients requiring revision surgeries, the number of and actual costs to settle lawsuits filed against us, and the amount of third-party insurance recoveries.
310764_13_ITEM7_P69_S3	Based on the information that has been received, we estimate the probable loss to resolve this matter to be in the range of approximately $190 to $390, before third-party insurance recoveries.
310764_13_ITEM7_P69_S4	Accordingly, in December 2012 we recorded a charge to earnings of $174 representing the excess of the $190 minimum of the range over the previously recorded reserves.
310764_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	for third-party recoveries was recorded as of December 31, 2012.
310764_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	As noted above, the final outcome of this matter is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict.
310764_13_ITEM7_P71_S1	The ultimate cost to entirely resolve this matter may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	In 2010 we received a subpoena from the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) related to the sales and marketing of the OtisKnee device.
310764_13_ITEM7_P72_S1	The subpoena concerns allegations of violations of Federal laws related to sales of a device not cleared by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
310764_13_ITEM7_P72_S2	We entered into discussions with the DOJ regarding the potential resolution of this matter and, in the second quarter of 2012 we recorded a non-tax deductible charge of $33 for this matter.
310764_13_ITEM7_P72_S3	We continue to discuss this matter with the DOJ, but there can be no assurance that we will reach a consensual resolution rather than seeking a resolution through the courts.
310764_13_ITEM7_P72_S4	While we believe we have strong arguments to defend against these allegations, if our defense is ultimately unsuccessful we estimate that it is reasonably possible that the total cost to resolve this matter may be approximately two times greater than the amount we have accrued.
310764_13_ITEM7_P72_S5	The final outcome of this matter is difficult to predict, and the ultimate cost to resolve this matter may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	In 2010 a shareholders' derivative action complaint against certain of our current and former Directors and Officers was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan Southern Division.
310764_13_ITEM7_P73_S1	This lawsuit was brought by the Westchester Putnam Counties Heavy and Highway Laborers Local 60 Benefit Funds and Laborers Local 235 Benefit Funds.
310764_13_ITEM7_P73_S2	The complaint alleged claims for breach of fiduciary duties and gross mismanagement in connection with certain product recalls, FDA warning letters, government investigations relating to physician compensation and the criminal proceeding brought against our Biotech division.
310764_13_ITEM7_P73_S3	We recently entered into a settlement agreement that requires changes to certain of Stryker's corporate governance practices.
310764_13_ITEM7_P73_S4	For each of the following legal matters the final outcome is dependent on many variables and cannot be predicted.
310764_13_ITEM7_P73_S5	Accordingly, it is not possible at this time for us to estimate any material loss or range of losses.
310764_13_ITEM7_P73_S6	However, the ultimate cost to resolve these matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	In April 2011 lawsuits brought by Hill-Rom Company, Inc. and affiliated entities (Hill-Rom) against us were filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin and the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.
310764_13_ITEM7_P74_S1	The Wisconsin lawsuit was subsequently transferred to the United States District Court in Indiana.
310764_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	The suits allege infringement under United States patent laws with respect to certain patient handling equipment we manufactured and sold and seek damages and permanent injunctions.
310764_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	The first lawsuit involved ten patents related to the use of a motorized wheel for hospital beds and stretchers.
310764_13_ITEM7_P76_S1	We recently entered into an agreement settling that lawsuit.
310764_13_ITEM7_P76_S2	This agreement included a payment to Hill-Rom of $3.75, a covenant not to sue and a cross-license.
310764_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	The second lawsuit involves nine patents related to electrical network communications for hospital beds.
310764_13_ITEM7_P77_S1	The case has been stayed with respect to six of the patents, which are currently under reexamination by the United States Patent Office.
310764_13_ITEM7_P77_S2	With respect to the suit and the three remaining patents, we continue to vigorously defend ourselves.
310764_13_ITEM7_P77_S3	The ultimate resolution of the second suit may have no relation to the resolution of the first suit and cannot be predicted; however, the ultimate cost could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	In 2010 we received a subpoena from the DOJ related to sales, marketing and regulatory matters related to the Stryker PainPump.
310764_13_ITEM7_P78_S1	We recently received requests for certain documents in connection with this investigation.
310764_13_ITEM7_P78_S2	The investigation is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the DOJ regarding this matter.
310764_13_ITEM7_P79_S0	In 2007 we disclosed that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made an inquiry of us regarding possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in connection with the sale of medical devices in certain foreign countries.
310764_13_ITEM7_P79_S1	Subsequently, in 2008, we received a subpoena from the United States DOJ, Criminal Division, requesting certain documents for the period since January 1, 2000 in connection with the SEC inquiry.
310764_13_ITEM7_P79_S2	We are fully cooperating with the DOJ and the SEC regarding these matters.
310764_13_ITEM7_P80_S0	In 2007 the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS) issued us a civil subpoena seeking to determine whether we violated various laws by paying consulting fees and providing other things of value to orthopedic surgeons and healthcare and educational institutions as inducements to use Stryker's orthopedic medical devices in procedures paid for in whole or in part by Medicare.
310764_13_ITEM7_P80_S1	We have produced numerous documents and other materials to HHS in response to the subpoena.
310764_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We consider our material area of market risk exposure to be exchange rate risk.
310764_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about exchange rate risk are included in the "Other Information" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition in Item 7, under the caption "Hedging and Derivative Financial Instruments" on page 19.

310764_13_ITEM8_P1_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
310764_13_ITEM8_P2_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).

310764_13_ITEM8_P10_S0	Stryker Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2012 NOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature of Operations: Stryker Corporation (the "Company," "we," "us," or "our") is one of the world's leading medical technology companies.
310764_13_ITEM8_P10_S1	Our products include implants used in joint replacement and trauma surgeries; surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems; endoscopic and communications systems; patient handling and emergency medical equipment; neurosurgical, neurovascular and spinal devices; as well as other medical device products used in a variety of medical specialties.
310764_13_ITEM8_P11_S0	The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its subsidiaries.
310764_13_ITEM8_P12_S0	Use of Estimates: Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures.
310764_13_ITEM8_P12_S1	These estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future.
310764_13_ITEM8_P12_S2	Estimates are used in accounting for, among other items, pensions, stock options, valuation of acquired intangible assets, useful lives for depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain income tax positions and contingencies.
310764_13_ITEM8_P12_S3	Actual results may ultimately differ from estimates.
310764_13_ITEM8_P13_S0	Sales are recognized when revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned.
310764_13_ITEM8_P13_S1	Our policy is to recognize revenue when title to the product, ownership and risk of loss transfer to the customer, which can be on the date of shipment, the date of receipt by the customer or, for most reconstructive products, when we receive appropriate notification that the product has been used or implanted.
310764_13_ITEM8_P13_S2	A provision for estimated sales returns, discounts, rebates and other sales incentives is recorded as a reduction of net sales in the same period that the revenue is recognized.
310764_13_ITEM8_P13_S3	Shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in net sales.
310764_13_ITEM8_P14_S0	Cost of Sales: Cost of sales is primarily comprised of direct materials and supplies consumed in the manufacture of product, as well as manufacturing labor, depreciation expense and direct overhead expense necessary to acquire and convert the purchased materials and supplies into finished product.
310764_13_ITEM8_P14_S1	Cost of sales also includes the cost to distribute products to customers, inbound freight costs, warehousing costs and other shipping and handling activity.
310764_13_ITEM8_P15_S0	Research, Development and Engineering Expenses: Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred.
310764_13_ITEM8_P15_S1	Costs include expenditures for new product and manufacturing process innovation and improvements to existing products and processes.
310764_13_ITEM8_P15_S2	Costs primarily consist of salaries, wages, consulting and depreciation and maintenance of research facilities and equipment.
310764_13_ITEM8_P15_S3	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: Selling, general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of selling expenses, marketing expenses, administrative and other indirect overhead costs, amortization of loaner instrumentation, depreciation and amortization expense of non-manufacturing assets and other miscellaneous operating items.
310764_13_ITEM8_P16_S0	Currency Translation: Financial statements of subsidiaries outside the United States generally are measured using the local currency as the functional currency.
310764_13_ITEM8_P16_S1	Adjustments to translate those statements into United States dollars are recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI).
310764_13_ITEM8_P17_S0	Transactional exchange gains and losses are included in earnings.
310764_13_ITEM8_P18_S0	Cash Equivalents: Highly liquid investments with remaining stated maturities of three months or less when purchased are considered cash equivalents and recorded at cost.
310764_13_ITEM8_P19_S0	Marketable Securities: Marketable securities consist of marketable debt securities and certificates of deposit and mutual funds.
310764_13_ITEM8_P19_S1	Mutual funds are acquired to offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements and are expected to be used to settle these liabilities.
310764_13_ITEM8_P20_S0	Pursuant to our investment policy, all individual marketable security investments must have a minimum credit quality of single A (per Standard Poor s and Fitch) and A2 (per Moody s Corporation) at the time of acquisition, while the overall portfolio of marketable securities must maintain a minimum average credit quality of double A (per Standard Poor s and Fitch) or Aa (per Moody s Corporation).
310764_13_ITEM8_P20_S1	In the event of a rating downgrade below the minimum credit quality subsequent to purchase, the marketable security investment is evaluated to determine the appropriate action to take to minimize the overall risk to our marketable security investment portfolio.
310764_13_ITEM8_P20_S2	As of December 31, 2012, less than 1% of our investments in marketable securities had a credit quality rating of less than single A (per Standard Poor s and Fitch) and A2 (per Moody s Corporation).
310764_13_ITEM8_P21_S0	Our marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and trading securities.
310764_13_ITEM8_P22_S0	Accounts receivable consists of trade and other miscellaneous receivables.
310764_13_ITEM8_P22_S1	An allowance is maintained for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable.
310764_13_ITEM8_P22_S2	Estimates are made regarding the ability of customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends.
310764_13_ITEM8_P22_S3	Accounts receivable are written off when all reasonable collection efforts are exhausted.
310764_13_ITEM8_P23_S0	Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost generally determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method.
310764_13_ITEM8_P24_S0	For excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell specific products at prices in excess of current carrying costs, reserves are maintained to reduce current carrying cost to market prices.
310764_13_ITEM8_P25_S0	Financial Instruments: Our financial instruments consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, other investments, accounts payable, debt and foreign currency exchange contracts.
310764_13_ITEM8_P25_S1	With the exception of our long-term debt, which is discussed in further detail in Note 7, our estimates of fair value for financial instruments approximate their carrying amounts as of December 31, 2012 and 2011.
310764_13_ITEM8_P26_S0	All marketable securities are recognized at fair value.
310764_13_ITEM8_P26_S1	Adjustments to the fair value of marketable securities that are classified as available-for-sale are recorded as increases or decreases, net of income taxes, within accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity and adjustments to the fair value of marketable securities that are classified as trading are recorded in earnings.
310764_13_ITEM8_P27_S0	The amortized cost of marketable debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity computed under the effective interest method.
310764_13_ITEM8_P27_S1	Such amortization is included in other income (expense) along with interest and realized gains and losses.
310764_13_ITEM8_P28_S0	The cost of securities sold is determined by the specific identification method.
310764_13_ITEM8_P29_S0	We review declines in the fair value of our investments classified as available-for-sale for impairment to determine whether the decline in fair value is an other-than-temporary impairment.
310764_13_ITEM8_P29_S1	The resulting losses from other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale marketable securities are included in earnings.
310764_13_ITEM8_P30_S0	All derivatives are recognized at fair value.
310764_13_ITEM8_P31_S0	We enter into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting our risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates.
310764_13_ITEM8_P31_S1	These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products.
310764_13_ITEM8_P31_S2	The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies.
310764_13_ITEM8_P31_S3	All forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period, with resulting gains (losses) included in earnings.
310764_13_ITEM8_P32_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost.
310764_13_ITEM8_P32_S1	Depreciation is computed by either the straight-line or declining-balance method over the estimated useful lives of 3 to 30 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 10 years for machinery and equipment.
310764_13_ITEM8_P33_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2010, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our OP-1 product family for use in orthopaedic bone applications and the related manufacturing facility in West Lebanon, NH.
310764_13_ITEM8_P33_S1	As a result of the announcement we recorded a $76 (net of taxes) impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the associated assets to their fair value.
310764_13_ITEM8_P33_S2	At December 31, 2010 the assets held for sale included in current assets in our Consolidated Balance sheet totaled $62 ( $29 net property, plant and equipment, $25 inventories and $8 other).
310764_13_ITEM8_P33_S3	On February 1, 2011, we completed the sale for total consideration of $60 .
310764_13_ITEM8_P33_S4	No material gain or loss was recorded upon the completion of the transaction.
310764_13_ITEM8_P34_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of tangible net assets of acquired businesses at the acquisition date, after amounts allocated to other identifiable intangible assets.
310764_13_ITEM8_P34_S1	Factors that contribute to the recognition of goodwill include securing synergies that are specific to our business and not available to other market participants and are expected to increase revenues and profits; acquisition of a talented workforce; cost savings opportunities; the strategic benefit of expanding our presence in core and adjacent markets; and diversifying our product portfolio.
310764_13_ITEM8_P35_S0	The fair values of other identifiable intangible assets are primarily determined using the income approach.
310764_13_ITEM8_P35_S1	Other intangible assets include, but are not limited to, developed technology, customer relationships (which reflect expected continued customer patronage) and trademarks and patents.
310764_13_ITEM8_P35_S2	Intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 4 to 40 years.
310764_13_ITEM8_P36_S0	In certain of our acquisitions, we acquire in-process research and development (IPRD) intangible assets.
310764_13_ITEM8_P36_S1	IPRD is considered to be an indefinite-lived intangible asset until such time as the research is completed (at which time it becomes a determinable-lived intangible asset) or determined to have no future use (at which time it is impaired).
310764_13_ITEM8_P37_S0	Goodwill, Intangibles and Long-Lived Asset Impairment Tests: We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year.
310764_13_ITEM8_P37_S1	We have adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-08, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other: Testing Goodwill for Impairment , which permits us to consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill.
310764_13_ITEM8_P38_S0	In certain circumstances, we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability.
310764_13_ITEM8_P38_S1	Indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested at least annually for impairment by comparing the individual carrying values to the fair value.
310764_13_ITEM8_P38_S2	We review long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
310764_13_ITEM8_P38_S3	The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows.
310764_13_ITEM8_P38_S4	Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the asset's useful life based on updated projections.
310764_13_ITEM8_P39_S0	indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique.
310764_13_ITEM8_P40_S0	Assets classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
310764_13_ITEM8_P41_S0	Stock Options: At December 31, 2012, we had long-term incentive plans that are described more fully in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under which stock options are granted to key employees and non-employee directors.
310764_13_ITEM8_P41_S1	We measure the cost of employee stock options based on the grant-date fair value and recognize that cost using the straight-line method over the period during which a recipient is required to provide services in exchange for the options, typically the vesting period.
310764_13_ITEM8_P41_S2	The weighted-average fair value per share of options granted during 2012, 2011 and 2010, estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, was $13.36 , $17.14 and $15.87 , respectively.
310764_13_ITEM8_P41_S3	The fair value of options granted was estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:
310764_13_ITEM8_P42_S0	The risk-free interest rate for periods within the expected life of options granted is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
310764_13_ITEM8_P43_S0	Expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock.
310764_13_ITEM8_P43_S1	The expected option life, representing the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, is based on historical option exercise and employee termination data.
310764_13_ITEM8_P44_S0	Income Taxes: Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted income tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.
310764_13_ITEM8_P44_S1	Deferred income tax benefits generally represent the change in net deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year.
310764_13_ITEM8_P44_S2	Other amounts result from adjustments related to acquisitions as appropriate.
310764_13_ITEM8_P45_S0	We operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both within the United States and internationally.
310764_13_ITEM8_P45_S1	Accordingly, management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations.
310764_13_ITEM8_P45_S2	Income tax authorities in these jurisdictions regularly perform audits of our income tax filings.
310764_13_ITEM8_P45_S3	Income tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing, product royalty and foreign branch arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates.
310764_13_ITEM8_P46_S0	Legal and Other Contingencies: We are involved in various proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property and other matters that are more fully described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_13_ITEM8_P46_S1	The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time.
310764_13_ITEM8_P47_S0	In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory and equitable relief, that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief.
310764_13_ITEM8_P47_S1	For legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management s best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded.
310764_13_ITEM8_P47_S2	The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies.
310764_13_ITEM8_P47_S3	The components of accumulated other comprehensive income are as follows:
310764_13_ITEM8_P48_S0	Recently Issued Accounting Standards: In 2013 the FASB issued ASU 2013-02, Presentation of Comprehensive Income: Reclassifications Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.
310764_13_ITEM8_P48_S1	The guidance requires an entity to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income if the amount is reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period.
310764_13_ITEM8_P48_S2	For other amounts not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period, a cross reference to other disclosures that provide additional detail about the reclassification amounts is required.
310764_13_ITEM8_P48_S3	These provisions are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012, applied prospectively.
310764_13_ITEM8_P48_S4	We do not expect this amendment to have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_13_ITEM8_P49_S0	In 2012 the FASB issued ASU 2012-02, Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment .
310764_13_ITEM8_P49_S1	This update amended the procedures for testing the impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets by permitting an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired.
310764_13_ITEM8_P49_S2	An entity s assessment of the totality of events and circumstances and their impact on the entity s indefinite-lived intangible assets will then be used as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test as described in ASC 350-30, Intangibles Goodwill and Other General Intangibles Other than Goodwill.
310764_13_ITEM8_P50_S0	ASU 2012-02 is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012, with early adoption permitted.
310764_13_ITEM8_P51_S0	We do not expect this amendment to have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_13_ITEM8_P52_S0	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the presentation used in 2012, primarily with respect to correct the classification of non-current deferred income taxes.
310764_13_ITEM8_P53_S0	NOTE 2 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Accounting guidance on fair value measurements for certain financial assets and liabilities requires that financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
310764_13_ITEM8_P53_S1	Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
310764_13_ITEM8_P53_S2	Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity's own assumptions or external inputs from active markets.
310764_13_ITEM8_P54_S0	When applying fair value principles in the valuation of assets and liabilities, we are required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
310764_13_ITEM8_P55_S0	We calculate the fair value of our Level 1 and Level 2 instruments based on the exchange traded price of similar or identical instruments, where available, or based on other observable inputs.
310764_13_ITEM8_P55_S1	There were no significant transfers into or out of Level 1 or Level 2 that occurred between December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012 .
310764_13_ITEM8_P56_S0	The fair value of our Level 3 assets and liabilities are calculated as the net present value of expected cash flows based on externally provided or obtained inputs.
310764_13_ITEM8_P56_S1	Certain Level 3 assets may also be based on sale prices of similar assets.
310764_13_ITEM8_P57_S0	Our fair value calculations take into consideration our credit risk and that of our counterparties.
310764_13_ITEM8_P57_S1	Should a counterparty default, our maximum exposure to loss is the asset balance of the instrument.
310764_13_ITEM8_P57_S2	We did not change our valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the year.
310764_13_ITEM8_P57_S3	Our valuation of our assets and liabilities measured at fair value:
310764_13_ITEM8_P58_S0	The following is a rollforward of our assets and liabilities measured at fair value using unobservable inputs (Level 3):
310764_13_ITEM8_P59_S0	The estimated fair value of the liability for contingent consideration represents milestone payments for acquisitions.
310764_13_ITEM8_P59_S1	The fair value of the liability was estimated using a discounted cash flow technique.
310764_13_ITEM8_P59_S2	Significant inputs to this technique included our probability assessments of occurrence of triggering events, appropriately discounted considering the uncertainties associated with the obligation.
310764_13_ITEM8_P59_S3	We remeasure this liability each reporting period and record the changes in the fair value in general and administrative expense (for probability of occurrence) and other income (expense) (for changes in time value of money) in earnings.
310764_13_ITEM8_P60_S0	The following table presents quantitative information about the inputs and valuation methodologies we use for material fair value measurements classified in Level 3:
310764_13_ITEM8_P61_S0	The following is a summary of our marketable securities:
310764_13_ITEM8_P62_S0	The unrealized losses on our available-for-sale marketable securities were primarily caused by increases in yields as a result of changing conditions in the global credit markets.
310764_13_ITEM8_P62_S1	While some of these investments have been downgraded by rating agencies since their initial purchase, less than 1% of our investments in available-for-sale marketable securities had a credit quality rating of less than single A (per Standard Poors and Fitch) and A2 (per Moody's).
310764_13_ITEM8_P62_S2	Because we do not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, we do not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2012 .
310764_13_ITEM8_P63_S0	The cost and estimated fair value of available-for-sale marketable securities at December 31, 2012 by contractual maturity are:
310764_13_ITEM8_P64_S0	The gross unrealized losses and fair value of our investments with unrealized losses that are not deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, aggregated by investment category and length of time that the individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at December 31, 2012 , are as follows:
310764_13_ITEM8_P65_S0	Interest and marketable securities income totaled $47 , $34 , and $49 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and is included in Other Income (Expense).
310764_13_ITEM8_P66_S0	The estimated fair value of our forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points.
310764_13_ITEM8_P66_S1	We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on our outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our counterparties.
310764_13_ITEM8_P66_S2	Should a counterparty default, our maximum exposure to loss is the asset balance of the instrument.
310764_13_ITEM8_P67_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, recognized foreign currency transaction gains (losses) included in other income (expense) in earnings were ($7) , ($3) and $7 , respectively.
310764_13_ITEM8_P67_S1	The outstanding derivative contracts and their effects on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2012 and 2011 were:
310764_13_ITEM8_P68_S0	NOTE 4 - ACQUISITIONS In November 2012 we acquired Surpass Medical, Ltd. (Surpass) in an all cash transaction for $100 , with an additional $35 to be paid upon the completion of certain milestones.
310764_13_ITEM8_P69_S0	Surpass develops and commercializes next-generation flow diversion stent technology to treat brain aneurysms using a unique mesh design and delivery system.
310764_13_ITEM8_P69_S1	The acquisition of Surpass enhances our product offerings within our Neurotechnology and Spine segment.
310764_13_ITEM8_P69_S2	In October 2011 we acquired Concentric Medical, Inc. (Concentric), which manufactures and markets minimally invasive products for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, in an all cash transaction for $135 .
310764_13_ITEM8_P69_S3	The acquisition of Concentric enhances our product offerings within our Neurotechnology and Spine segment.
310764_13_ITEM8_P70_S0	In July 2011 we acquired Memometal Technologies (Memometal) in an all cash transaction for $150 , including assumed debt of $9 , and an additional $12 to be paid upon the completion of certain milestones.
310764_13_ITEM8_P70_S1	Memometal develops, manufactures and markets products for extremity (hand and foot) indications.
310764_13_ITEM8_P70_S2	The acquisition of Memometal enhances our product offerings within our Reconstructive segment.
310764_13_ITEM8_P71_S0	In June 2011 we acquired Orthovita, Inc. (Orthovita), a developer and manufacturer of orthobiologic and biosurgery products, in an all cash transaction for $316 .
310764_13_ITEM8_P71_S1	The acquisition of Orthovita complements our existing product offerings, primarily within our Neurotechnology and Spine segment.
310764_13_ITEM8_P71_S2	In January 2011 we acquired the assets of the Neurovascular division of Boston Scientific Corporation (Neurovascular) in an all cash transaction for $1,450 , with an additional $50 payment to be made upon completion of certain milestones.
310764_13_ITEM8_P71_S3	The acquisition of Neurovascular substantially enhances our presence in the neurotechnology market, allowing us to offer a comprehensive portfolio of products in both neurosurgical and neurovascular devices.
310764_13_ITEM8_P71_S4	The effects of all the acquisitions described above are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements prospectively from the date of acquisition.
310764_13_ITEM8_P71_S5	Pro forma consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 would not differ significantly as a result of these acquisitions.
310764_13_ITEM8_P72_S0	The purchase price allocations are based upon preliminary valuations, and our estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period as valuations are finalized.
310764_13_ITEM8_P72_S1	The preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the acquired net assets of the acquisitions described above are as follows:
310764_13_ITEM8_P73_S0	The measurement periods for each of the 2011 acquisitions were finalized in 2012 and did not differ materially from the preliminary allocations.
310764_13_ITEM8_P74_S0	NOTE 5 - GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS We completed our annual impairment tests of goodwill and concluded that no impairments exist.
310764_13_ITEM8_P75_S0	The changes in the net carrying value of goodwill by segment are as follows:
310764_13_ITEM8_P76_S0	The following is a summary of our other intangible assets:
310764_13_ITEM8_P77_S0	The estimated amortization expense for each of the next five years is as follows:
310764_13_ITEM8_P78_S0	NOTE 6 - CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS We are involved in various ongoing proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property and other matters.
310764_13_ITEM8_P78_S1	The outcomes of certain of these matters will not be known for prolonged periods of time.
310764_13_ITEM8_P78_S2	In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory and equitable relief, that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief.
310764_13_ITEM8_P78_S3	For legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management's best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded.
310764_13_ITEM8_P78_S4	Estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies.
310764_13_ITEM8_P78_S5	If actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.
310764_13_ITEM8_P78_S6	To partially mitigate losses arising from unfavorable outcomes in such matters, we purchase third-party insurance coverage subject to certain deductibles and loss limitations.
310764_13_ITEM8_P78_S7	Future operating results may be unfavorably impacted by any settlement payments or losses beyond the amounts of insurance carried.
310764_13_ITEM8_P78_S8	In addition, such matters may negatively impact our ability to obtain cost effective third-party insurance coverage in future periods.
310764_13_ITEM8_P78_S9	On June 28, 2012 we voluntarily recalled our Rejuvenate and ABG II modular-neck hip stems and terminated global distribution of these hip products.
310764_13_ITEM8_P78_S10	We notified healthcare professionals and regulatory bodies of this recall, which was undertaken due to potential risks associated with fretting and/or corrosion that may lead to adverse local tissue reactions.
310764_13_ITEM8_P78_S11	Product liability lawsuits relating to this voluntary recall have been filed against us.
310764_13_ITEM8_P79_S0	As previously announced, we intend to reimburse implanted patients for reasonable and customary costs of testing and treatment services, including any necessary revision surgeries.
310764_13_ITEM8_P79_S1	We continue to work with the medical community to evaluate the data and further understand this matter and the associated costs.
310764_13_ITEM8_P79_S2	The ultimate total cost with respect to this matter will depend on many factors that are difficult to predict with the limited information received to date and may vary materially based on the number of and actual costs of patients seeking testing and treatment services, the number of and actual costs of patients requiring revision surgeries, the number of and actual costs to settle lawsuits filed against us, and the amount of third-party insurance recoveries.
310764_13_ITEM8_P79_S3	Based on the information that has been received, we estimate the probable loss to resolve this matter to be in the range of approximately $190 to $390 , before third-party insurance recoveries.
310764_13_ITEM8_P79_S4	Accordingly, in December 2012 we recorded a charge to earnings of $174 representing the excess of the $190 minimum of the range over the previously recorded reserves.
310764_13_ITEM8_P80_S0	for third-party recoveries was recorded as of December 31, 2012.
310764_13_ITEM8_P81_S0	As noted above, the final outcome of this matter is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict.
310764_13_ITEM8_P81_S1	The ultimate cost to entirely resolve this matter may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_13_ITEM8_P82_S0	In 2010 we received a subpoena from the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) related to the sales and marketing of the OtisKnee device.
310764_13_ITEM8_P82_S1	The subpoena concerns allegations of violations of Federal laws related to sales of a device not cleared by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
310764_13_ITEM8_P82_S2	We entered into discussions with the DOJ regarding the potential resolution of this matter and, in the second quarter of 2012, we recorded a non-tax deductible charge of $33 for this matter.
310764_13_ITEM8_P82_S3	We continue to discuss this matter with the DOJ, but there can be no assurance that we will reach a consensual resolution rather than seeking a resolution through the courts.
310764_13_ITEM8_P82_S4	While we believe we have strong arguments to defend against these allegations, if our defense is ultimately unsuccessful we estimate that it is reasonably possible that the total cost to resolve this matter may be approximately two times greater than the amount we have accrued.
310764_13_ITEM8_P82_S5	The final outcome of this matter is difficult to predict, and the ultimate cost to resolve this matter may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_13_ITEM8_P83_S0	In 2010 a shareholders' derivative action complaint against certain of our current and former Directors and Officers was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan Southern Division.
310764_13_ITEM8_P83_S1	This lawsuit was brought by the Westchester Putnam Counties Heavy and Highway Laborers Local 60 Benefit Funds and Laborers Local 235 Benefit Funds.
310764_13_ITEM8_P83_S2	The complaint alleged claims for breach of fiduciary duties and gross mismanagement in connection with certain product recalls, FDA warning letters, government investigations relating to physician compensation and the criminal proceeding brought against our Biotech division.
310764_13_ITEM8_P83_S3	We recently entered into a settlement agreement that requires changes to certain of Stryker's corporate governance practices.
310764_13_ITEM8_P83_S4	For each of the following legal matters the final outcome is dependent on many variables and cannot be predicted.
310764_13_ITEM8_P83_S5	Accordingly, it is not possible at this time for us to estimate any material loss or range of losses.
310764_13_ITEM8_P83_S6	However, the ultimate cost to resolve these matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_13_ITEM8_P84_S0	In April 2011 lawsuits brought by Hill-Rom Company, Inc. and affiliated entities (Hill-Rom) against us were filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin and the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.
310764_13_ITEM8_P84_S1	The Wisconsin lawsuit was subsequently transferred to the United States District Court in Indiana.
310764_13_ITEM8_P85_S0	The suits allege infringement under United States patent laws with respect to certain patient handling equipment we manufactured and sold and seek damages and permanent injunctions.
310764_13_ITEM8_P86_S0	The first lawsuit involved ten patents related to the use of a motorized wheel for hospital beds and stretchers.
310764_13_ITEM8_P86_S1	We recently entered into an agreement settling that lawsuit.
310764_13_ITEM8_P86_S2	This agreement included a payment to Hill-Rom of $3.75 , a covenant not to sue and a cross-license.
310764_13_ITEM8_P87_S0	The second lawsuit involves nine patents related to electrical network communications for hospital beds.
310764_13_ITEM8_P87_S1	The case has been stayed with respect to six of the patents, which are currently under reexamination by the United States Patent Office.
310764_13_ITEM8_P87_S2	With respect to the suit and the three remaining patents, we continue to vigorously defend ourselves.
310764_13_ITEM8_P87_S3	The ultimate resolution of the second suit may have no relation to the resolution of the first suit and cannot be predicted; however, the ultimate cost could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_13_ITEM8_P88_S0	In 2010 we received a subpoena from the DOJ related to sales, marketing and regulatory matters related to the Stryker PainPump.
310764_13_ITEM8_P88_S1	The DOJ has recently requested certain documents related to this matter.
310764_13_ITEM8_P88_S2	We are fully cooperating with the DOJ regarding this matter and the investigation is ongoing.
310764_13_ITEM8_P89_S0	In 2007 we disclosed that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made an inquiry of us regarding possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in connection with the sale of medical devices in certain foreign countries.
310764_13_ITEM8_P89_S1	Subsequently, in 2008, we received a subpoena from the United States DOJ, Criminal Division, requesting certain documents for the period since January 1, 2000 in connection with the SEC inquiry.
310764_13_ITEM8_P89_S2	We are fully cooperating with the DOJ and the SEC regarding these matters.
310764_13_ITEM8_P90_S0	In 2007 the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS) issued us a civil subpoena seeking to determine whether we violated various laws by paying consulting fees and providing other things of value to orthopedic surgeons and healthcare and educational institutions as inducements to use Stryker's orthopedic medical devices in procedures paid for in whole or in part by Medicare.
310764_13_ITEM8_P90_S1	We have produced numerous documents and other materials to HHS in response to the subpoena.
310764_13_ITEM8_P90_S2	We have purchase commitments for materials, supplies, services and property, plant and equipment as part of the normal course of business.
310764_13_ITEM8_P90_S3	In addition, we lease various manufacturing, warehousing and distribution facilities, administrative and sales offices as well as equipment under operating leases.
310764_13_ITEM8_P90_S4	Future commitments under these obligations and minimum lease commitments under these leases are:
310764_13_ITEM8_P91_S0	Rent expense totaled $98 , $96 , and $81 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
310764_13_ITEM8_P91_S1	NOTE 7 - LONG-TERM DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES Our debt is summarized as follows:
310764_13_ITEM8_P92_S0	In August 2012 we refinanced our credit facility with a new $1,000 Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility due August 2017 (2012 Facility).
310764_13_ITEM8_P92_S1	The 2012 Facility replaced the previously outstanding $1,000 Unsecured Credit Facility due in August 2013 .
310764_13_ITEM8_P92_S2	The 2012 Facility includes an increase option permitting us to increase the size of the facility up to an additional $500 , a $500 multicurrency sublimit (with no sublimit for euro borrowings) and a $100 letter of credit sublimit.
310764_13_ITEM8_P92_S3	The 2012 Facility has an annual facility fee ranging from 5 to 22.5 basis points and bears interest at LIBOR, as defined in the 2012 Facility agreement, plus an applicable margin ranging from 57.5 to 127.5 basis points , both of which are dependent on our credit ratings.
310764_13_ITEM8_P92_S4	The 2012 Facility requires us to comply with certain financial and other covenants.
310764_13_ITEM8_P92_S5	We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2012 .
310764_13_ITEM8_P92_S6	In September 2011 we sold $750 of unsecured notes due September 2016 (the 2016 Notes).
310764_13_ITEM8_P92_S7	The 2016 Notes bear interest at 2.00% per year and, unless previously redeemed, will mature on September 30, 2016 .
310764_13_ITEM8_P92_S8	We received net proceeds of $749 , net of an offering discount of $1 .
310764_13_ITEM8_P93_S0	On July 15, 2011, we entered into a commercial paper program (the Program) under which we may issue, on a private placement basis, unsecured commercial paper notes (the Notes) up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $500 .
310764_13_ITEM8_P93_S1	We may issue the Notes under the Program from time to time.
310764_13_ITEM8_P93_S2	The net proceeds from the sale of the Notes will be used for general corporate purposes.
310764_13_ITEM8_P94_S0	The Program contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and indemnification provisions.
310764_13_ITEM8_P94_S1	The maturities of the Notes will vary but may not exceed 397 days, and the Notes must be in a minimum denomination of $0.25 .
310764_13_ITEM8_P94_S2	The Notes will be sold at a discount from par or, alternatively, will be sold at par and bear interest at either a fixed or floating rate that will vary based upon market conditions at the time of the issuance of the Notes.
310764_13_ITEM8_P94_S3	The interest on a floating rate Note may be (a) the CD rate, (b) the commercial paper rate, (c) the federal funds rate, (d) the LIBOR rate, (e) the prime rate, (f) the treasury rate or (g) such other base rate as may be specified at the time of issuance.
310764_13_ITEM8_P94_S4	The Notes will not be redeemable prior to maturity or be subject to voluntary prepayment.
310764_13_ITEM8_P94_S5	As of December 31, 2012, no Notes had been issued under the Program.
310764_13_ITEM8_P95_S0	In addition, we have lines of credit, issued by various financial institutions, available to fund our day-to-day operating needs.
310764_13_ITEM8_P95_S1	At December 31, 2012 , we had $1,063 of borrowing capacity available under all of our existing credit facilities.
310764_13_ITEM8_P95_S2	The weighted-average interest rate, excluding required fees, for all borrowings was 3.0% at December 31, 2012 .
310764_13_ITEM8_P96_S0	At December 31, 2012 , total unamortized debt issuance costs incurred in connection with our unsecured notes were $10 .
310764_13_ITEM8_P96_S1	The fair value of long-term debt (including current maturities) at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 was $1,866 and $1,837 , respectively, based on the quoted interest rates for similar types and amounts of borrowing agreements.
310764_13_ITEM8_P96_S2	Interest expense, including required fees incurred on outstanding debt and credit facilities, which is included in other income (expense), totaled $63 , $56 , and $53 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
310764_13_ITEM8_P96_S3	Interest paid on debt, including required fees, was $55 , $39 and $39 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
310764_13_ITEM8_P97_S0	In December of 2012, 2011 and 2010, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized us to purchase up to $405 , $500 and $500 , respectively, of our common stock (the 2012, 2011 and 2010 Repurchase Programs, respectively).
310764_13_ITEM8_P97_S1	The manner, timing and amount of purchases is determined by management based on an evaluation of market conditions, stock price and other factors and is subject to regulatory considerations.
310764_13_ITEM8_P97_S2	Purchases are to be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.
310764_13_ITEM8_P97_S3	Under the 2010 Repurchase Program, we repurchased 2.1 million shares at a cost of $108 during 2012.

310764_13_ITEM8_P97_S5	We had not made any repurchases pursuant to the 2012 or 2011 Repurchase Programs at December 31, 2012 .
310764_13_ITEM8_P98_S0	Shares repurchased under the share repurchase programs are available for general corporate purposes, including offsetting dilution associated with stock option and other equity-based employee benefit plans.
310764_13_ITEM8_P99_S0	Shares reserved for future compensation grants of Stryker common stock were 29 million at December 31, 2012 and 32 million at December 31, 2011.
310764_13_ITEM8_P99_S1	We have 0.5 million authorized shares of $1 par value preferred stock, none of which is outstanding.
310764_13_ITEM8_P100_S0	Stock Options We have long-term incentive plans from which we grant stock options to certain key employees and non-employee directors at an exercise price not less than the fair market value of the underlying common stock, which is the closing quoted price of our common stock on the day prior to the date of grant.
310764_13_ITEM8_P100_S1	The options are granted for periods of up to 10 years and become exercisable in varying installments.
310764_13_ITEM8_P100_S2	A summary of stock option activity follows:
310764_13_ITEM8_P101_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value, which represents the cumulative difference between the fair market value of the underlying common stock and the option exercise prices, of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $52 , $69 and $73 , respectively.
310764_13_ITEM8_P101_S1	Exercise prices for options outstanding at December 31, 2012 ranged from $37.86 to $67.80 .
310764_13_ITEM8_P101_S2	At December 31, 2012, there was $64 of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options granted under the long-term incentive plans; that cost is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average period of 1.5 years.
310764_13_ITEM8_P102_S0	We grant RSUs to key employees and non-employee directors and PSUs to key employees under our long-term incentive plans.
310764_13_ITEM8_P102_S1	The fair value of RSUs is determined based on the number of shares granted and the closing quoted price of our common stock on the day prior to the date of grant less anticipated dividends.
310764_13_ITEM8_P102_S2	RSUs generally vest in one-third increments over a three-year period and are settled in stock.
310764_13_ITEM8_P102_S3	PSU's are earned over a three-year performance cycle and vest in March of the year following the end of that performance cycle.
310764_13_ITEM8_P102_S4	The number of PSUs that will ultimately be earned is based on our performance relative to pre-established goals during that three-year performance cycle.
310764_13_ITEM8_P102_S5	The fair value of PSUs is determined based on the closing quoted price of our common stock on the day prior to the date of grant.

310764_13_ITEM8_P104_S0	Employee Stock Purchase Plans (ESPP) Full-time and part-time employees may participate in our ESPP provided they meet certain eligibility requirements.
310764_13_ITEM8_P104_S1	The purchase price for our common stock under the terms of the ESPP is defined as 95% of the closing stock price on the last trading day of a purchase period.
310764_13_ITEM8_P104_S2	During 2012 and 2011, we issued 196,267 and 185,529 shares, respectively, under the ESPP.
310764_13_ITEM8_P105_S0	In 2012 and 2011 we recorded $40 and $38 , respectively, in severance and related costs in connection with a focused reduction of our global workforce and other restructuring activities expected to reduce our global workforce by approximately 5% .
310764_13_ITEM8_P105_S1	The targeted reductions and other restructuring activities were initiated to provide efficiencies and realign resources in advance of the Medical Device Excise Tax, as well as to allow for continued investment in strategic areas and drive growth.
310764_13_ITEM8_P105_S2	In addition, in 2012 and 2011 we recorded $7 and $25 , respectively, in asset impairment, $3 and $6 , respectively, in agent conversion and $25 and $7 , respectively, in contractual and other obligations, as certain of our restructuring actions resulted in the discontinued use of specific assets and the exit of certain lease and other commitments.
310764_13_ITEM8_P105_S3	We expect our current restructuring actions and related cash payments will be completed by the end of 2013.
310764_13_ITEM8_P105_S4	A summary of our restructuring liability balance and full-year restructuring activity is as follows:
310764_13_ITEM8_P106_S0	NOTE 10 - INCOME TAXES Earnings before income taxes consisted of:
310764_13_ITEM8_P107_S0	In 2011 we recorded an income tax benefit related to a favorable settlement with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regarding its proposed adjustment to our previously filed 2003 through 2007 income tax returns related to income tax positions we had taken for our cost sharing arrangements with two wholly-owned entities operating in Ireland, and we recorded charges for other uncertain tax positions related to the outcome of the IRS settlements.
310764_13_ITEM8_P107_S1	The net income tax benefit of these adjustments was $82 .
310764_13_ITEM8_P108_S0	Reconciliation of the United States federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate:
310764_13_ITEM8_P109_S0	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities were comprised of:
310764_13_ITEM8_P110_S0	Net operating loss carryforwards totaling $284 at December 31, 2012 are available to reduce future taxable earnings of certain domestic and foreign subsidiaries.
310764_13_ITEM8_P110_S1	United States loss carryforwards of $146 expire between 2012 and 2021 .
310764_13_ITEM8_P110_S2	International loss carryforwards of $138 expire beginning in 2013; however, some have no expiration .
310764_13_ITEM8_P110_S3	Of these carryforwards, $51 are subject to a full valuation allowance.
310764_13_ITEM8_P110_S4	No provision has been made for United States federal and state income taxes or international income taxes that may result from future remittances of the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are determined to be indefinitely reinvested ( $6,232 at December 31, 2012).
310764_13_ITEM8_P110_S5	Determination of the amount of any unrecognized deferred income tax liability on these is not practicable.
310764_13_ITEM8_P110_S6	The changes in the amounts recorded for uncertain income tax positions are as follows:
310764_13_ITEM8_P111_S0	Our income tax expense could have been reduced by $216 and $235 at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively, had these uncertain income tax positions been favorably resolved.
310764_13_ITEM8_P111_S1	It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change due to one or more of the following events in the next twelve months: expiring statutes, audit activity, tax payments, competent authority proceedings related to transfer pricing or final decisions in matters that are the subject of controversy in various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing, product royalty and foreign branch arrangements.
310764_13_ITEM8_P111_S2	We are not able to reasonably estimate the amount or the future periods in which changes in unrecognized tax benefits may be resolved.
310764_13_ITEM8_P111_S3	Interest expense and penalties incurred associated with uncertain tax positions are included in other income (expense).
310764_13_ITEM8_P112_S0	In the normal course of business, income tax authorities in various income tax jurisdictions both within the United States and internationally conduct routine audits of our income tax returns filed in prior years.
310764_13_ITEM8_P112_S1	These audits are generally designed to determine if individual income tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretations of complex income tax regulations regarding the allocation of income to the various income tax jurisdictions.
310764_13_ITEM8_P112_S2	With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to audits by income tax authorities for tax years prior to 2008.
310764_13_ITEM8_P112_S3	Income tax years subsequent to 2008 are open to examination in many of the income tax jurisdictions in which we operate.
310764_13_ITEM8_P113_S0	NOTE 11 - RETIREMENT PLANS We provide certain employees with defined contribution plans.
310764_13_ITEM8_P113_S1	A portion of our retirement plan expense under the defined contribution plans is funded with Stryker common stock.
310764_13_ITEM8_P114_S0	The use of Stryker common stock represents a non-cash operating activity that is not reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
310764_13_ITEM8_P115_S0	Certain of our subsidiaries have both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans covering some or all of their employees.
310764_13_ITEM8_P115_S1	Substantially all of the defined benefit pension plans have projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets.
310764_13_ITEM8_P116_S0	The estimated net actuarial loss for the defined benefit pension plans to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost in the year ended December 31, 2013 is ($7) .
310764_13_ITEM8_P116_S1	We estimate that an immaterial amount of amortization of prior service cost and transition amount for the defined benefit pension plans will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost in the year ended December 31, 2013.
310764_13_ITEM8_P117_S0	Pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets had projected benefit obligations, accumulated benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets of $447 , $417 and $254 , respectively, at December 31, 2012 and $298 , $292 and $195 , respectively, at December 31, 2011.
310764_13_ITEM8_P118_S0	Discount rate The discount rates were selected using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds at December 31 that would provide the necessary cash flows to match our projected benefit payments.
310764_13_ITEM8_P119_S0	Expected return on plan assets The expected return on plan assets is determined by applying the target allocation in each asset category of plan investments to the anticipated return for each asset category based on historical and projected returns.
310764_13_ITEM8_P120_S0	The investment strategy for our defined benefit pension plans is to meet the liabilities of the plans as they fall due and to maximize the return on invested assets within appropriate risk tolerances.
310764_13_ITEM8_P121_S0	The weighted-average target and actual allocation of plan assets by asset category is as follows:
310764_13_ITEM8_P122_S0	Our Level 3 pension plan assets (See Note 2 for an explanation of our fair value hierarchy) consist primarily of guaranteed investment contracts with insurance companies.
310764_13_ITEM8_P122_S1	The insurance contracts guarantee us principal repayment and a fixed rate of return.
310764_13_ITEM8_P123_S0	Our valuation of Level 3 assets is based on third-party actuarial valuations that are an estimation of the surrender value of the guaranteed investment contract between us and the insurance company.
310764_13_ITEM8_P123_S1	The surrender value equals the actuarial value of the notional investments underlying the guaranteed investment contract, using the actuarial assumptions as stated in the guaranteed investment contract.
310764_13_ITEM8_P124_S0	We expect to contribute $19 to our defined benefit pension plans in 2013.
310764_13_ITEM8_P124_S1	The estimated future benefit payments by year based on expected future service as appropriate are:
310764_13_ITEM8_P125_S0	NOTE 12 - SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA We segregate our operations into three reportable business segments: Reconstructive, MedSurg, and Neurotechnology and Spine.
310764_13_ITEM8_P126_S0	The Reconstructive segment includes orthopaedic reconstructive (hip and knee) and trauma implant systems as well as other related products.
310764_13_ITEM8_P126_S1	The MedSurg segment includes surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems (Instruments); endoscopic and communications systems (Endoscopy); patient handling and emergency medical equipment (Medical); and other related products.
310764_13_ITEM8_P126_S2	The Neurotechnology and Spine segment includes neurovascular products, spinal implant systems and other related products.
310764_13_ITEM8_P126_S3	The Other category shown in the table below includes corporate and global operations administration, central research and development initiatives, interest expense, interest and marketable securities income and share-based compensation, which includes compensation related to both employee and director stock option, restricted stock unit and performance stock unit grants.
310764_13_ITEM8_P127_S0	Our reportable segments are business units that offer different products and services and are managed separately because each business requires different manufacturing, technology and marketing strategies.
310764_13_ITEM8_P127_S1	The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_13_ITEM8_P128_S0	We measure the financial results of our reportable segments using an internal performance measure that excludes acquisition and integration-related charges, restructuring and related charges, reserves for certain legal matters, certain impairments and gains on property, plant and equipment, and certain income tax adjustments associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings.
310764_13_ITEM8_P129_S0	Identifiable assets are those assets used exclusively in the operations of each business segment or allocated when used jointly.
310764_13_ITEM8_P129_S1	Corporate assets are principally cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and property, plant and equipment.
310764_13_ITEM8_P130_S0	The countries in which we have local revenue generating operations have been combined into the following geographic areas: the United States (including Puerto Rico); Europe, Middle East, Africa (EMEA); Asia Pacific; and other foreign countries, which include Canada and countries in the Latin American region.
310764_13_ITEM8_P130_S1	Sales are attributable to a geographic area based upon the customer s country of domicile.
310764_13_ITEM8_P130_S2	Net property, plant and equipment are based upon physical location of the assets.
310764_13_ITEM8_P131_S0	The price quotations reported above were supplied by the New York Stock Exchange.
310764_13_ITEM8_P132_S0	In February 2013 we made a voluntary general offer to acquire all the shares of Trauson Holdings Company Limited for HK$7.50 per ordinary share for a total consideration of $764 in an all cash transaction.
310764_13_ITEM8_P132_S1	This acquisition, which is expected to close before the end of the second quarter of 2013, will expand our presence in a key emerging market with a product portfolio and pipeline that is targeted at the value segment of the Chinese orthopaedic market.
310764_13_ITEM8_P133_S0	In February 2013 we won a jury verdict of $70 in lost profits for infringement of three of our patents relating to pulsed lavage systems in a patent infringement suit that we filed in the Western District of Michigan against a competitor.
310764_13_ITEM8_P133_S1	It is expected that the defendant will file post-trial motions seeking to overturn the jury verdict and that it will appeal if unsuccessful in that regard.
310764_13_ITEM8_P133_S2	We will record this gain when all related contingencies are resolved.
310764_13_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures An evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2012 was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Interim Chief Financial Officer and Vice President, Corporate Secretary (the Certifying Officers).
310764_13_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on that evaluation, the Certifying Officers concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
310764_13_ITEM9A_P0_S2	There was no change to our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2012 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
310764_13_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The management of Stryker Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f).
310764_13_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Stryker Corporation s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company's management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
310764_13_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Stryker Corporation s management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012.
310764_13_ITEM9A_P1_S3	In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework .
310764_13_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Based on that assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.
310764_13_ITEM9A_P1_S5	Stryker Corporation s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
310764_13_ITEM9A_P1_S6	This report appears on the following page.
310764_13_ITEM9A_P1_S7	Other Matters We are in an ongoing process of implementing new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems at certain of our divisions.
310764_13_ITEM9A_P1_S8	An ERP system is a fully-integrated set of programs and databases that incorporate order processing, production planning and scheduling, purchasing, accounts receivable and inventory management and accounting.
310764_13_ITEM9A_P1_S9	In connection with this ERP system implementation, we are updating our internal controls over financial reporting, as necessary, to accommodate modifications to our business processes and accounting procedures.
310764_13_ITEM9A_P1_S10	We do not believe that this ERP system implementation will have an adverse effect on our internal control over financial reporting.
310764_13_ITEM9A_P2_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF STRYKER CORPORATION:
310764_13_ITEM9A_P3_S0	We have audited Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
310764_13_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries' management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
310764_13_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
310764_13_ITEM9A_P4_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
310764_13_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
310764_13_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
310764_13_ITEM9A_P4_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
310764_13_ITEM9A_P5_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
310764_13_ITEM9A_P5_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
310764_13_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
310764_13_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
310764_13_ITEM9A_P7_S0	In our opinion, Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the COSO criteria.

310764_13_ITEM15_P54_S1	In cases where you utilize the net exercise arrangement and the Fair Market Value of the number of whole Shares withheld is greater than the aggregate Exercise Price, the Company shall make a cash payment to you equal to the difference as soon as administratively practicable.

310764_13_ITEM15_P55_S1	In cases where the Fair Market Value of the number of whole Shares withheld is greater than the minimum Tax-Related Items required to be withheld, the Company shall make a cash payment to you equal to the difference as soon as administratively practicable.
310764_13_ITEM15_P55_S2	The cash equivalent of the Shares withheld will be used to settle the obligation to withhold the Tax-Related Items.
310764_13_ITEM15_P55_S3	Alternatively, your Employer may withhold the minimum Tax-Related Items required to be withheld with respect to the Shares in cash from your regular salary and/or wages, or other amounts payable to you.
310764_13_ITEM15_P55_S4	In the event the withholding requirements are not satisfied through the withholding of Shares or through your regular salary and/or wages or any other amounts payable to you by your Employer, no Shares will be issued to you (or your estate) upon exercise of the Options unless and until satisfactory arrangements (as determined by the Board of Directors) have been made by you with respect to the payment of any Tax-Related Items that the Company or your Employer determines, in its sole discretion, must be withheld or collected with respect to such Options.

310764_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	Stryker was incorporated in Michigan in 1946 as the successor company to a business founded in 1941 by Dr. Homer H. Stryker, a prominent orthopaedic surgeon and the inventor of several orthopaedic products.
310764_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	In the United States, most of our products are marketed directly to doctors, hospitals and other healthcare facilities.
310764_14_ITEM1_P3_S1	Internationally, our products are sold in over 100 countries through company-owned sales subsidiaries and branches as well as third-party dealers and distributors.
310764_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	As used herein, and except where the context otherwise requires, "Stryker," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Stryker Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
310764_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	We segregate our reporting into three reportable business segments: Reconstructive, MedSurg, and Neurotechnology and Spine.
310764_14_ITEM1_P5_S1	Financial information regarding our reportable business segments and certain geographic information is included under "Results of Operations" in Item 7 of this report and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.
310764_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	The net sales for each reportable segment over the last three years was:
310764_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	Reconstructive products consist primarily of implants used in hip and knee joint replacements and trauma and extremities surgeries.
310764_14_ITEM1_P7_S1	We bring patients and physicians advanced implant designs and specialized instrumentation that make orthopaedic surgery and recovery simpler, faster and more effective.
310764_14_ITEM1_P7_S2	We support surgeons with the technology and services they need as they develop new surgical techniques.
310764_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	The composition of net sales of Reconstructive products over the last three years was:
310764_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	In December 2013 we acquired MAKO Surgical Corp. (MAKO).
310764_14_ITEM1_P9_S1	The acquisition of MAKO, combined with our strong history in joint reconstruction, capital equipment (operating room integration and surgical navigation) and surgical instruments, will help further advance the growth of robotic arm assisted surgery.
310764_14_ITEM1_P9_S2	Our combined expertise offers the potential to simplify joint reconstruction procedures, reduce variability and enhance the surgeon and patient experience.
310764_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	In March 2013 we acquired Trauson Holdings Company Limited (Trauson).
310764_14_ITEM1_P10_S1	The acquisition of Trauson will enhance our product offerings, primarily within our Reconstructive segment, broaden our presence in China and enable us to expand into the fast growing value segment of the emerging markets.
310764_14_ITEM1_P10_S2	In 2013 we launched the Tritanium Cementless Baseplate for our Triathlon Knee System (TKA), which combines biologic fixation with Triathlon s ideal kinematics to provide surgeons with a superior option for cementless TKA.
310764_14_ITEM1_P10_S3	We also launched the Secur-Fit Advanced Femoral Hip Stem aimed at accurately restoring biomechanics by leveraging our new and unique Stryker Orthopaedics Modeling and Analytics system.
310764_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	In June 2012 we voluntarily recalled our Rejuvenate and ABG II modular-neck hip stems and terminated global distribution of these hip products.
310764_14_ITEM1_P11_S1	We notified healthcare professionals and regulatory bodies of this recall, which was taken due to potential risks associated with fretting and/or corrosion that may lead to adverse local tissue reactions.
310764_14_ITEM1_P11_S2	We continue to work with the medical community to evaluate the data and further understand this matter and the associated costs as more fully described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report; this information is incorporated herein by reference.
310764_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	In 2012 we launched Accolade II, the first hip stem with a Morphometric Wedge design, an evolution of the tapered wedge stem.
310764_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	In 2011 we acquired Memometal Technologies, which develops, manufactures and markets products for extremity (hand and foot) indications that enhance the offerings in our trauma and extremities product line.
310764_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	We are also a leading player in the international markets, with these same companies as our principal competitors.
310764_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	MedSurg products include surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems (Instruments); endoscopic and communications systems (Endoscopy); patient handling and emergency medical equipment (Medical); and reprocessed and remanufactured medical devices as well as other medical device products used in a variety of medical specialties.

310764_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	In December 2013 we announced our intent to acquire Patient Safety Technologies, Inc. (PST).

310764_14_ITEM1_P17_S2	The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2014.
310764_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	In March 2013 we received a warning letter from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concerning quality system observations made during an inspection and citing us for failing to notify the FDA of a product recall and for marketing devices, including certain of our Neptune Waste Management Systems, without a required 510(k) clearance.
310764_14_ITEM1_P18_S1	We were notified in January 2014 that the actions taken to address issues raised in the warning letter are sufficient and no further corrective actions related to the warning letter are required.
310764_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	In December 2013 we received 510(k) clearance to market a modified Neptune 2 Waste Management System.

310764_14_ITEM1_P29_S2	Additional geographic information is included under "Results of Operations" in Item 7 of this report and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.
310764_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	Raw materials essential to our business are generally readily available from multiple sources.
310764_14_ITEM1_P30_S1	Substantially all products we manufacture are stocked in inventory, while certain MedSurg products are assembled to order.
310764_14_ITEM1_P30_S2	The dollar amount of backlog orders at any given time is not considered material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole.
310764_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	Patents and trademarks are significant to our business to the extent that a product or an attribute of a product represents a unique design or process.
310764_14_ITEM1_P31_S1	Patent protection of such products restricts competitors from duplicating these unique designs and features.
310764_14_ITEM1_P31_S2	We seek to obtain patent protection on our products whenever appropriate for protecting our competitive advantage.
310764_14_ITEM1_P31_S3	As of December 31, 2013 we owned approximately 1,783 United States patents and 3,420 international patents.
310764_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	Our business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of reconstructive implant surgeries is generally lower during the summer months and sales of capital equipment are generally stronger in the fourth quarter.
310764_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	In all of our product lines we compete with local and global companies located throughout the world.
310764_14_ITEM1_P33_S1	Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved.
310764_14_ITEM1_P33_S2	The development of new and innovative products is important to our success in all areas of our business and competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant.
310764_14_ITEM1_P33_S3	The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and in maintaining sales forces.
310764_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	The principal factors that we believe differentiate us in the highly competitive product categories in which we operate and enable us to compete effectively include our commitment to innovation and quality, service and reputation.
310764_14_ITEM1_P34_S1	We believe that our competitive position in the future will depend to a large degree on our ability to develop new products and make improvements to existing products.
310764_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	Most of our products and product improvements have been developed internally at research facilities in the United States, Ireland, Puerto Rico, Germany, Switzerland, India and France.
310764_14_ITEM1_P35_S1	We also invest through acquisitions in technologies developed by third parties that have the potential to expand the markets in which we operate.
310764_14_ITEM1_P35_S2	We maintain close working relationships with physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist us in product development efforts.
310764_14_ITEM1_P35_S3	The total costs of worldwide company-sponsored research, development and engineering activities relating to the development of new products, improvement of existing products, technical support of products and compliance with governmental regulations for the protection of customers and patients were $536 , $471 and $462 in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
310764_14_ITEM1_P35_S4	Research, development and engineering expenses as a percentage of sales were 5.9% , 5.4% and 5.6% in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
310764_14_ITEM1_P35_S5	The spending level in 2013 increased due to the timing of projects and continued investment in new technologies.
310764_14_ITEM1_P35_S6	The spending level in 2012 as a percentage of sales decreased primarily due to the termination of all development of the OP-1 molecule in late 2011.
310764_14_ITEM1_P36_S0	Our businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation.
310764_14_ITEM1_P37_S0	In the United States, the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its subsequent amendments, and the regulations issued or proposed thereunder, provide for regulation by the FDA of the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices, including most of our products.
310764_14_ITEM1_P37_S1	Many of our new products fall into FDA classifications that require notification of and review by the FDA before we begin marketing them, submitted as a 510(k).
310764_14_ITEM1_P37_S2	Certain of our products require extensive clinical testing, consisting of safety and efficacy studies, followed by pre-market approval (PMA) applications for specific surgical indications.
310764_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	The FDA's Quality System regulations set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the FDA.
310764_14_ITEM1_P38_S1	There are also certain requirements of state, local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the manufacture and marketing of our products.
310764_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	medical device regulations for all EU member countries.
310764_14_ITEM1_P39_S1	These regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member countries to meet certain quality system requirements and obtain CE marking for their products.
310764_14_ITEM1_P39_S2	We have authorization to apply the CE marking to substantially all of our products.
310764_14_ITEM1_P39_S3	In addition, we comply with the unique regulatory requirements of each of the countries in which we market our products.
310764_14_ITEM1_P40_S0	Initiatives sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare expenses generally and hospital costs in particular, including price regulation and competitive pricing, are ongoing in markets where we do business.
310764_14_ITEM1_P40_S1	It is not possible to predict at this time the long-term impact of such cost containment measures on our future business.
310764_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	In addition, business practices in the healthcare industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the United States, by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.
310764_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	At December 31, 2013 , we had approximately 25,000 employees worldwide.
310764_14_ITEM1_P43_S0	Certain international employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
310764_14_ITEM1_P44_S0	We believe that we maintain positive relationships with our employees worldwide.
310764_14_ITEM1_P45_S0	Information regarding our executive officers appears under the caption "Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance" in Item 10 of this Report.
310764_14_ITEM1_P46_S0	Our main corporate website address is www.stryker.com.

310764_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	This report contains statements referring to us that are not historical facts and are considered "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These statements, which are intended to take advantage of the "safe harbor" provisions of the Reform Act, are based on current projections about operations, industry conditions, financial condition and liquidity.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	"possible," "plan," "predict," "forecast," "potential," "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "believe," "may impact," "on track," and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance, an acquisition or our businesses.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Those statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Therefore, actual results could differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forward-looking statements include the risks discussed below.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The impact of United States healthcare reform legislation on our business remains uncertain.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In 2010 federal legislation to reform the United States healthcare system was enacted into law.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The legislation is far-reaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage, improve the quality and reduce the costs of healthcare over time.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Its provisions become effective at various dates and there are many programs and requirements for which the details have not been determined.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P4_S3	We expect the law will have a significant impact upon various aspects of our business operations.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Among other things, the law imposes a 2.3 percent excise tax on Class I, II and III medical devices that applies to United States sales of a majority of our medical device products.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Other provisions of this legislation, including Medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs, comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies, could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P4_S6	Further, we cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will be ultimately implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the United States.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P4_S7	However, any change that lowers reimbursements for our products or reduces medical procedure volumes could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Cost containment measures in the United States and other countries resulting in pricing pressures could have a negative impact on our future operating results.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Initiatives sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation and competitive pricing, are ongoing in markets where we do business.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	relating to sales and promotion, reimbursement and pricing generally.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Reductions in reimbursement levels or coverage or other cost containment measures could unfavorably affect our future operating results.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We may be adversely affected by product liability claims, unfavorable court decisions or legal settlements.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices, many of which are intended to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	We are currently defendants in a number of product liability matters, including those relating to the voluntary recall in 2012 of our Rejuvenate and ABGII modular neck hip stems discussed in "Other Information-Legal and Regulatory Matters" in Item 7 of this report and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P7_S3	These matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P7_S4	In addition, we may incur significant legal expenses regardless of whether we are found to be liable.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P7_S5	The Company is currently self-insured for product liability-related claims and expenses.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P7_S6	The ultimate cost to us with respect to pro duct liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Intellectual property litigation and infringement claims could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling certain of our products.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The medical device industry is characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation and, from time to time, we are the subject of claims by third parties of potential infringement or misappropriation.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Regardless of outcome, such claims are expensive to defend and divert the time and effort of management and operating personnel from other business issues.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P9_S2	A successful claim or claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments or negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products in the affected category.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Dependence on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to such rights may impact offerings in our product portfolios.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our long-term success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	If we fail to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property protection, such a failure could allow others to sell products that compete with offerings in our product portfolio.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Also, our issued patents are subject to claims concerning priority, scope and other issues, and currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to the manufacturing, labeling and marketing of our products.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Substantially all of our products are subject to regulation by the FDA and other governmental authorities in the United States and internationally.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P12_S2	The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis, if at all.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	subject to periodic inspections by the FDA to determine compliance with the quality system and medical device reporting regulations and other requirements.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	If we fail to fully comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to a range of sanctions, including warning letters, product recalls, the suspension of product manufacturing, monetary fines and criminal prosecution.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We are subject to federal, state and foreign healthcare regulations, including fraud and abuse laws, as well as anti-bribery laws, and could face substantial penalties if we fail to fully comply with such regulations and laws.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Our relationship with healthcare professionals, such as physicians, hospitals and those that may market our products, are subject to scrutiny under various state and federal laws often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P14_S2	In addition, the United States and foreign government regulators have increased the enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P14_S3	These laws are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation, which could require us to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if we are found not to be in compliance.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P14_S4	We also must comply with a variety of other laws which protect the privacy of individually identifiable healthcare information and impose extensive tracking and reporting related to all transfers of value provided to certain healthcare professionals.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Macroeconomic developments, such as the recent recessions in Europe and the debt crises in certain countries in the European Union, could negatively affect our ability to conduct business in those geographies.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The continuing debt crises in certain European Union countries could cause the value of the euro to deteriorate, reducing the purchasing power of our European Union customers.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers and customers, including distributors, could result in product delays and inventory issues; risks to accounts receivable could also include delays in collection and greater bad debt expense.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross border transactions and translation of local currency results into United States dollars.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Cross border transactions, both with external parties and intercompany relationships, result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P16_S2	In addition, our sales are translated into United States dollars for reporting purposes.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P16_S3	The strengthening or weakening of the United States dollar results in favorable or unfavorable translation effects as the results of our foreign locations are translated into United States dollars.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We may be unable to effectively develop and market products against the products of our competitors in a highly competitive industry.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by our competitors.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	technology, innovation, quality, reputation and reliability.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Our competition may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us or be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees and strategic partners.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Given these factors, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue our level of success in the industry.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Competition in research, involving the development and improvement of new and existing products, is particularly significant and results from time to time in product obsolescence.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Such marketplace changes may cause some of our products to become obsolete.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P19_S3	If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, a higher level of inventory write downs may result.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We may be unable to maintain adequate working relationships with healthcare professionals.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We seek to maintain close working relationships with respected physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist in product research and development.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We rely on these professionals to assist us in the development of proprietary products and product improvements to complement and expand our existing product lines.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P20_S3	If we are unable to maintain these relationships, our ability to develop, market and sell new and improved products could decrease.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We are subject to additional risks associated with our extensive international operations.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We develop, manufacture and distribute our products throughout the world.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Our international operations are subject to a number of additional risks and potential costs, including changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs, unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements, differing local product preferences and product requirements, diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations, political and economic instability.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Our results of operations and/or financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks of international operations in an increasingly volatile environment.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We may be unable to capitalize on previous or future acquisitions.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	In addition to internally developed products, we rely upon investment in new technologies through acquisitions.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Investments in medical technology are inherently risky, and we cannot guarantee that any acquisition will be successful or will not have a material unfavorable impact on us.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P22_S3	These risks include the activities required by us to integrate new businesses, which may result in the need to allocate more resources to integration and product development activities than originally anticipated, diversion of management's time, which could adversely affect management's ability to focus on other projects, the inability to realize the expected benefits, savings or synergies from the acquisition, the loss of key personnel of the acquired company, and exposure to unexpected liabilities of the acquired company.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	addition, we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so, which may result in unexpected impairment charges.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We may record future goodwill impairment charges related to one or more of our business units, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P24_S2	In evaluating the potential for impairment we make assumptions regarding revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows, tax rates, and discount rates.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P24_S3	These assumptions are uncertain and by nature may vary from actual results.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P24_S4	A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our results of operations.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our results of operations could be negatively impacted by future changes in the allocation of income to each of the income tax jurisdictions in which we operate.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both in the United States and internationally.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Accordingly, our management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each jurisdiction based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Income tax authorities regularly perform audits of our income tax filings.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Income tax audits associated with the allocation of income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing, product royalty and foreign branch arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P26_S4	If changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates, the related adjustments could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Failure of a key information technology system, process or site could have a material adverse impact on our business.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We rely extensively on information technology systems to conduct business.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	These systems include, but are not limited to, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping products to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, providing data security and other processes necessary to manage our business.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P28_S2	If our systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively compensate on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our operations.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We may be unable to attract and retain key employees.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Our sales, technical and other key personnel play an integral role in the development, marketing and selling of new and existing products.
310764_14_ITEM1A_P29_S2	If we are unable to recruit, hire, develop and retain a talented, competitive work force, we may not be able to meet our strategic business objectives.
310764_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	The following are our principal manufacturing locations as of December 31, 2013 :
310764_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	Our corporate headquarters are located in Kalamazoo, Michigan, in a 75,000 square foot owned facility.
310764_14_ITEM2_P1_S1	In addition, we maintain administrative and sales offices and warehousing and distribution facilities in multiple countries.
310764_14_ITEM2_P1_S2	We believe that our properties are suitable and adequate for the manufacture and distribution of our products.
310764_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are involved in various proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property, and other matters that are more fully described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report; this information is incorporated herein by reference.
310764_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SYK.
310764_14_ITEM5_P0_S1	Quarterly stock price and dividend information for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were as follows:
310764_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	Our Board of Directors considers payment of cash dividends at each of its quarterly meetings.
310764_14_ITEM5_P1_S1	On January 31, 2014 , there were 3,556 shareholders of record of our common stock.
310764_14_ITEM5_P2_S0	In December of 2012 , 2011 and 2010, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized us to purchase up to $405 , $500 and $500 , respectively, of our common stock (the 2012, 2011 and 2010 Repurchase Programs, respectively).
310764_14_ITEM5_P2_S1	The manner, timing and amount of purchases is determined by management based on an evaluation of market conditions, stock price and other factors and is subject to regulatory considerations.
310764_14_ITEM5_P2_S2	Purchases are to be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.
310764_14_ITEM5_P3_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2013 we repurchased 1.4 million shares at a cost of $95 under the 2010 Repurchase Program and 3.4 million shares at a cost of $222 under the 2011 Repurchase Program.
310764_14_ITEM5_P3_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , the 2010 Repurchase Program was complete and the maximum dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the 2011 Repurchase Program was $278.
310764_14_ITEM5_P3_S2	We had made no repurchases pursuant to the 2012 Repurchase Program at December 31, 2013 .
310764_14_ITEM5_P4_S0	Shares repurchased under the share repurchase programs are available for general corporate purposes, including offsetting dilution associated with stock option and other equity-based employee benefit plans.
310764_14_ITEM5_P4_S1	At December 31, 2013 , the maximum dollar value of shares that may be purchased under the authorized Repurchase Programs was $683.
310764_14_ITEM5_P5_S0	The activity pursuant to the 2011 Repurchase Program for the three months ended December 31, 2013 is summarized as follows:
310764_14_ITEM5_P6_S0	The following graph compares our total returns (including reinvestments of dividends) against the Standard Poor s (S P) 500 Index and the S P 500 Health Care Index.
310764_14_ITEM5_P6_S1	The graph assumes $100 (not in millions) invested on December 31, 2008 in our Common Stock and each of the indices.
310764_14_ITEM6_P0_S0	Selected financial data for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 2013 is as follows:
310764_14_ITEM6_P1_S0	(a) Includes restructuring and asset impairment charges.
310764_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including percentage sales growth in constant currency; percentage organic sales growth; adjusted gross profit; adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses; adjusted operating income; adjusted other income (expense); adjusted effective income tax rate; adjusted net earnings; and adjusted diluted net earnings per share.
310764_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance.
310764_14_ITEM7_P0_S2	Management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses.
310764_14_ITEM7_P0_S3	Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these non-GAAP financial measures.
310764_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales.
310764_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	Percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates.
310764_14_ITEM7_P1_S2	To measure percentage organic sales growth, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions that affect the comparability and trend of sales.
310764_14_ITEM7_P1_S3	Percentage organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates excluding the impact of acquisitions.
310764_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	To measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings.
310764_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names.
310764_14_ITEM7_P2_S2	These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, operating income, other income/(expense), effective income tax rate, net earnings and diluted net earnings per share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
310764_14_ITEM7_P2_S3	These non-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures at the end of the discussion of Results of Operations below, provide a more complete understanding of our business.
310764_14_ITEM7_P2_S4	We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

310764_14_ITEM7_P20_S17	These funds are considered indefinitely reinvested to be used to expand operations either organically or through acquisitions outside the United States.
310764_14_ITEM7_P20_S18	We continually evaluate our receivables, particularly in Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece (the Southern European Region).
310764_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	We believe that our current reserves related to receivables are adequate and any additional credit risk associated with the Southern European Region is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial position or liquidity.
310764_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	We currently do not have any investments in the sovereign debt instruments of the Southern European Region.
310764_14_ITEM7_P21_S2	Any non-sovereign exposure in these countries in our investment portfolio is considered immaterial.
310764_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	We do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.
310764_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND FORWARD-LOOKING CASH REQUIREMENTS As further described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2013 we have recorded charges to earnings totaling $790 representing the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve the Rejuvenate and ABG II recalls.
310764_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	Based on the information that has been received, the actuarially determined range of probable loss to resolve this matter is estimated to be approximately $790 to $1,235 , before third-party insurance recoveries.
310764_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	The final outcome of this matter is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict.
310764_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	The ultimate cost to entirely resolve this matter may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	We are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which payments will be made.
310764_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	As further described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2013 our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by $175, of which approximately $174 related to plans outside the United States.
310764_14_ITEM7_P25_S2	Due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and the potential for changes in legislation in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, we are not able to reasonably estimate, beyond 2013, the amounts that may be required to fund defined benefit pension plans.
310764_14_ITEM7_P25_S3	As further described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2013 we have recorded a liability for uncertain income tax positions of $204 .
310764_14_ITEM7_P25_S4	Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits, we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made.
310764_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	Our future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than one year, including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business, are:
310764_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	In preparing our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application.
310764_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	These include allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, income taxes, acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets, and legal and other contingencies.
310764_14_ITEM7_P27_S2	We believe these accounting policies and the others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition.
310764_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable.
310764_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	We make estimates regarding the future ability of our customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends.
310764_14_ITEM7_P28_S2	If actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.
310764_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	We maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs.
310764_14_ITEM7_P29_S1	We make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends.
310764_14_ITEM7_P29_S2	If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.
310764_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	Our annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes.
310764_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements.
310764_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	in our tax return, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense.
310764_14_ITEM7_P32_S1	These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.
310764_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement.
310764_14_ITEM7_P33_S1	Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred, the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction has already been taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment.
310764_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes.
310764_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	Realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods.
310764_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.
310764_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments.
310764_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority.
310764_14_ITEM7_P36_S2	These differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment.
310764_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes.
310764_14_ITEM7_P37_S1	We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly.
310764_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions.
310764_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
310764_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	Because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events, such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans, could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate.
310764_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	We account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting.
310764_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	Under the purchase method, our financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition.
310764_14_ITEM7_P40_S2	In addition, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill.
310764_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives.
310764_14_ITEM7_P41_S1	Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant items.
310764_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain.
310764_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets.
310764_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.
310764_14_ITEM7_P43_S2	Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.
310764_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment.
310764_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	With the exception of certain trade names, the majority of our acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer and distributor relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives.
310764_14_ITEM7_P44_S2	Our assessment as to the useful lives of these intangible assets is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, trademark and/or brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarks or brands are sold.
310764_14_ITEM7_P44_S3	Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors.
310764_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life.
310764_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	In certain of our acquisitions, we acquire in-process research and development (IPRD) intangible assets.
310764_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	IPRD is considered to be an indefinite-lived intangible asset until such time as the research is completed (at which time it becomes a determinable-lived intangible asset) or determined to have no future use (at which time it is impaired).
310764_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment.
310764_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles.
310764_14_ITEM7_P47_S2	We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year.
310764_14_ITEM7_P47_S3	We have adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-08, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other: Testing Goodwill for Impairment , which permits us to consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill.
310764_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	In certain circumstances, we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability.
310764_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	In those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level.
310764_14_ITEM7_P48_S2	We test individual indefinite-lived intangibles by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value.
310764_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	We determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the income approach.
310764_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows.
310764_14_ITEM7_P50_S1	Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value.
310764_14_ITEM7_P50_S2	Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans.
310764_14_ITEM7_P50_S3	We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants.
310764_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	We did not recognize any material impairment charges for goodwill during the years presented, as our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill fair values exceeded their respective recorded values.
310764_14_ITEM7_P51_S1	Future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values.
310764_14_ITEM7_P51_S2	A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our financial statements.
310764_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	We review our other long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
310764_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level.
310764_14_ITEM7_P53_S1	The undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections.
310764_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique.
310764_14_ITEM7_P54_S1	Assets classified as held for sale, if any, are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
310764_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	We are involved in various ongoing proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property, and other matters that are more fully described in "Other Information" below and in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_14_ITEM7_P55_S1	The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time.
310764_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory and equitable relief, that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief.
310764_14_ITEM7_P56_S1	For legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management's best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded.
310764_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	If actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.
310764_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	The Company is currently self-insured for product liability-related claims and expenses.
310764_14_ITEM7_P58_S1	The ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS No accounting pronouncements that were issued or became effective during the year have had or are expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_14_ITEM7_P59_S1	OTHER INFORMATION Hedging and Derivative Financial Instruments We sell our products throughout the world.
310764_14_ITEM7_P59_S2	As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak economic conditions or changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
310764_14_ITEM7_P59_S3	Our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the United States dollar; European currencies, in particular the euro, Swiss franc and the British pound; the Japanese yen; the Australian dollar; and the Canadian dollar.
310764_14_ITEM7_P59_S4	We develop and manufacture products in the United States, China, France, Germany, Ireland, Puerto Rico and Switzerland and incur costs in the applicable local currencies.
310764_14_ITEM7_P59_S5	This worldwide deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on our cost of sales.
310764_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	We enter into designated and non-designated forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates.
310764_14_ITEM7_P60_S1	These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products.
310764_14_ITEM7_P60_S2	The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies.
310764_14_ITEM7_P60_S3	All forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period, with resulting gains (losses) for non-designated forward contracts and any ineffectiveness measured on designated forward currency exchange contracts included in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
310764_14_ITEM7_P60_S4	For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
310764_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points.
310764_14_ITEM7_P61_S1	A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar would change the December 31, 2013 fair value by approximately $6 .
310764_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	contracts, but we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our counterparties.
310764_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	We have certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged.
310764_14_ITEM7_P63_S1	These investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
310764_14_ITEM7_P63_S2	For 2013 the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar increased the value of these investments in net assets and the related foreign currency translation adjustment gain in shareholders' equity by $80 to $306 , from $226 as of December 31, 2012 .
310764_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	Legal and Regulatory Matters In 2010 we received a subpoena from the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) related to the sales and marketing of the OtisKnee device.
310764_14_ITEM7_P64_S1	The subpoena concerns allegations of violations of Federal laws related to sales of a device not cleared by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
310764_14_ITEM7_P64_S2	We continue to discuss the settlement of this matter with the DOJ, but there can be no assurance that we will reach a consensual resolution rather than seeking a resolution through the courts.
310764_14_ITEM7_P64_S3	We have recorded charges totaling $80 related to the above matter, including $47 in the year ended December 31, 2013.
310764_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	In June 2012 we voluntarily recalled our Rejuvenate and ABG II modular-neck hip stems and terminated global distribution of these hip products.
310764_14_ITEM7_P65_S1	We notified healthcare professionals and regulatory bodies of this recall, which was taken due to potential risks associated with fretting and/or corrosion that may lead to adverse local tissue reactions.
310764_14_ITEM7_P65_S2	Product liability lawsuits relating to this voluntary recall have been filed against us.
310764_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	As previously announced, we intend to reimburse implanted patients for reasonable and customary costs of testing and treatment services, including any necessary revision surgeries.
310764_14_ITEM7_P66_S1	We continue to work with the medical community to evaluate the data and further understand this matter and the associated costs.
310764_14_ITEM7_P66_S2	The ultimate total cost with respect to this matter will depend on many factors that are difficult to predict with the information received to date and may vary materially based on the number of and actual costs of patients seeking testing and treatment services, the number of and actual costs of patients requiring revision surgeries, the number of and actual costs to settle lawsuits filed against us, and the amount of third-party insurance recoveries.
310764_14_ITEM7_P66_S3	Based on the information that has been received, the actuarially determined range of probable loss to resolve this matter is estimated to be approximately $790 to $1,235 , before third-party insurance recoveries.
310764_14_ITEM7_P66_S4	In the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded charges to earnings of $600 representing the excess of the $790 minimum of the range over the previously recorded reserves.
310764_14_ITEM7_P66_S5	No contingent gain for third-party insurance recoveries was recorded as of December 31, 2013.
310764_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	As noted above, the final outcome of this matter is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict.
310764_14_ITEM7_P67_S1	The ultimate cost to entirely resolve this matter may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	In 2010 we filed a lawsuit in federal court against Zimmer Holdings, Inc. (Zimmer), alleging that a Zimmer product infringed three of our patents.
310764_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	2013, the trial judge upheld the February 2013 jury verdict in our favor, issued a permanent injunction barring Zimmer from making or selling infringing products, and ordered Zimmer to pay us at least $228 .
310764_14_ITEM7_P69_S1	Zimmer is appealing this ruling and the ultimate resolution of this matter may differ materially.
310764_14_ITEM7_P69_S2	Accordingly, we have not recorded a contingent gain related to this matter.
310764_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	For each of the following legal matters the final outcome is dependent on many variables and cannot be predicted.
310764_14_ITEM7_P70_S1	Accordingly, it is not possible at this time for us to estimate any material loss or range of losses.
310764_14_ITEM7_P70_S2	However, the ultimate cost to resolve these matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	In April 2011 lawsuits brought by Hill-Rom Company, Inc. and affiliated entities (Hill-Rom) against us were filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin and the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.
310764_14_ITEM7_P71_S1	The Wisconsin lawsuit was subsequently transferred to the United States District Court in Indiana.
310764_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	The suits allege infringement under United States patent laws with respect to certain patient handling equipment we manufactured and sold and seek damages and permanent injunctions.
310764_14_ITEM7_P72_S1	We have entered into an agreement settling the first lawsuit, with terms as previously disclosed.
310764_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	The second lawsuit involves nine patents related to electrical network communications for hospital beds.
310764_14_ITEM7_P73_S1	The case has been stayed with respect to six of the patents, which are currently under reexamination by the United States Patent Office.
310764_14_ITEM7_P73_S2	With respect to the three remaining patents, Hill-Rom is appealing the trial court's grant of summary judgment in our favor and the ultimate resolution of this particular part of the suit may differ.
310764_14_ITEM7_P73_S3	The ultimate resolution of the entire second suit may have no relation to the resolution of the first suit and cannot be predicted; however, the ultimate result could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	In 2010 we received a subpoena from the DOJ related to sales, marketing and regulatory matters related to the Stryker PainPump.
310764_14_ITEM7_P74_S1	We have received requests for certain documents in connection with this investigation.
310764_14_ITEM7_P74_S2	The investigation is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the DOJ regarding this matter.
310764_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We consider our material area of market risk exposure to be exchange rate risk.
310764_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about exchange rate risk are included in the "Other Information" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition in Item 7, under the caption Other Information - "Hedging and Derivative Financial Instruments".
310764_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Stryker Corporation :
310764_14_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , and the related consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 .
310764_14_ITEM8_P1_S1	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a).
310764_14_ITEM8_P1_S2	These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.
310764_14_ITEM8_P1_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
310764_14_ITEM8_P2_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
310764_14_ITEM8_P2_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
310764_14_ITEM8_P3_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
310764_14_ITEM8_P3_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
310764_14_ITEM8_P3_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
310764_14_ITEM8_P4_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 2013 and 2012 , and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
310764_14_ITEM8_P4_S1	Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
310764_14_ITEM8_P5_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Stryker Corpora tion's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) and our report dated February 13, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

310764_14_ITEM8_P10_S0	Stryker Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2013 NOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature of Operations: Stryker Corporation (the "Company," "we," "us," or "our") is one of the world's leading medical technology companies.
310764_14_ITEM8_P10_S1	Our products include implants used in joint replacement and trauma surgeries; surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems; endoscopic and communications systems; patient handling and emergency medical equipment; neurosurgical, neurovascular and spinal devices; as well as other medical device products used in a variety of medical specialties.
310764_14_ITEM8_P11_S0	The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its subsidiaries.
310764_14_ITEM8_P12_S0	Use of Estimates: Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures.
310764_14_ITEM8_P12_S1	These estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future.
310764_14_ITEM8_P12_S2	Estimates are used in accounting for, among other items, pensions, stock options, valuation of acquired intangible assets, useful lives for depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain income tax positions and contingencies.
310764_14_ITEM8_P12_S3	Actual results may ultimately differ from estimates.
310764_14_ITEM8_P13_S0	Sales are recognized when revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned.
310764_14_ITEM8_P13_S1	Our policy is to recognize revenue when title to the product, ownership and risk of loss transfer to the customer, which can be on the date of shipment, the date of receipt by the customer or, for most reconstructive products, when we receive appropriate notification that the product has been used or implanted.
310764_14_ITEM8_P13_S2	A provision for estimated sales returns, discounts, rebates and other sales incentives is recorded as a reduction of net sales in the same period that the revenue is recognized.
310764_14_ITEM8_P13_S3	Shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in net sales.
310764_14_ITEM8_P14_S0	Cost of Sales: Cost of sales is primarily comprised of direct materials and supplies consumed in the manufacture of product, as well as manufacturing labor, depreciation expense and direct overhead expense necessary to acquire and convert the purchased materials and supplies into finished product.
310764_14_ITEM8_P14_S1	Cost of sales also includes the cost to distribute products to customers, inbound freight costs, warehousing costs and other shipping and handling activity.
310764_14_ITEM8_P15_S0	Research, Development and Engineering Expenses: Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred.
310764_14_ITEM8_P16_S0	Costs primarily consist of salaries, wages, consulting and depreciation and maintenance of research facilities and equipment.
310764_14_ITEM8_P16_S1	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: Selling, general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of selling expenses, marketing expenses, administrative and other indirect overhead costs, amortization of loaner instrumentation, depreciation and amortization expense of non-manufacturing assets and other miscellaneous operating items.
310764_14_ITEM8_P17_S0	Currency Translation: Financial statements of subsidiaries outside the United States generally are measured using the local currency as the functional currency.
310764_14_ITEM8_P17_S1	Adjustments to translate those statements into United States dollars are recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI).
310764_14_ITEM8_P18_S0	Transactional exchange gains and losses are included in earnings.
310764_14_ITEM8_P19_S0	Cash Equivalents: Highly liquid investments with remaining stated maturities of three months or less when purchased are considered cash equivalents and recorded at cost.
310764_14_ITEM8_P20_S0	Marketable Securities: Marketable securities consist of marketable debt securities, certificates of deposit and mutual funds.
310764_14_ITEM8_P20_S1	Mutual funds are acquired to offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements and are expected to be used to settle these liabilities.
310764_14_ITEM8_P21_S0	Pursuant to our investment policy, all individual marketable security investments must have a minimum credit quality of single A (per Standard Poor s and Fitch) and A2 (per Moody s Corporation) at the time of acquisition, while the overall portfolio of marketable securities must maintain a minimum average credit quality of double A (per Standard Poor s and Fitch) or Aa (per Moody s Corporation).
310764_14_ITEM8_P21_S1	In the event of a rating downgrade below the minimum credit quality subsequent to purchase, the marketable security investment is evaluated to determine the appropriate action to take to minimize the overall risk to our marketable security investment portfolio.
310764_14_ITEM8_P22_S0	Our marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and trading securities.
310764_14_ITEM8_P23_S0	Accounts receivable consists of trade and other miscellaneous receivables.
310764_14_ITEM8_P23_S1	An allowance is maintained for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable.
310764_14_ITEM8_P23_S2	Estimates are made regarding the ability of customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends.
310764_14_ITEM8_P23_S3	Accounts receivable are written off when all reasonable collection efforts are exhausted.
310764_14_ITEM8_P24_S0	Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost generally determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method.
310764_14_ITEM8_P25_S0	For excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell specific products at prices in excess of current carrying costs, reserves are maintained to reduce current carrying cost to market prices.
310764_14_ITEM8_P26_S0	With the exception of our long-term debt, which is discussed in further detail in Note 8, our estimates of fair value for financial instruments approximate their carrying amounts as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 .
310764_14_ITEM8_P27_S0	All marketable securities are recognized at fair value.
310764_14_ITEM8_P27_S1	Adjustments to the fair value of marketable securities that are classified as available-for-sale are recorded as increases or decreases, net of income taxes, within accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) in shareholders equity and adjustments to the fair value of marketable securities that are classified as trading are recorded in earnings.
310764_14_ITEM8_P28_S0	The amortized cost of marketable debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity computed under the effective interest method.
310764_14_ITEM8_P28_S1	Such amortization is included in other income (expense) along with interest and realized gains and losses.
310764_14_ITEM8_P29_S0	The cost of securities sold is determined by the specific identification method.
310764_14_ITEM8_P30_S0	We review declines in the fair value of our investments classified as available-for-sale for impairment to determine whether the decline in fair value is an other-than-temporary impairment.
310764_14_ITEM8_P30_S1	The resulting losses from other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale marketable securities are included in earnings.
310764_14_ITEM8_P31_S0	Derivatives: All derivatives are recognized at fair value.
310764_14_ITEM8_P32_S0	We enter into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting our risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates.
310764_14_ITEM8_P32_S1	These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products.
310764_14_ITEM8_P32_S2	The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies.
310764_14_ITEM8_P32_S3	All forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period, with resulting gains (losses) included in earnings.
310764_14_ITEM8_P33_S0	Forward currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are designed to hedge the variability of cash flows associated with forecasted transactions denominated in a foreign currency that will take place in the future.
310764_14_ITEM8_P33_S1	Changes in value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI on the consolidated balance sheets until earnings are affected by the variability of the underlying cash flows.
310764_14_ITEM8_P33_S2	At that time, the applicable amount of gain or loss from the derivative instrument that is deferred in shareholders equity is reclassified into earnings and is included in other income (expense) or cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of earnings, depending on the underlying transaction that is being hedged.
310764_14_ITEM8_P34_S0	In December 2011 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued accounting guidance related to disclosures on offsetting assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.
310764_14_ITEM8_P35_S0	effects of those arrangements on its financial position.
310764_14_ITEM8_P35_S1	This accounting guidance was effective for the Company beginning in 2013.
310764_14_ITEM8_P36_S0	We have elected to report our derivative instruments on a gross basis.
310764_14_ITEM8_P37_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost.
310764_14_ITEM8_P37_S1	Depreciation is generally computed by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 3 to 30 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 10 years for machinery and equipment.
310764_14_ITEM8_P38_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of tangible net assets of acquired businesses at the acquisition date, after amounts allocated to other identifiable intangible assets.
310764_14_ITEM8_P38_S1	Factors that contribute to the recognition of goodwill include securing synergies that are specific to our business and not available to other market participants and are expected to increase revenues and profits; acquisition of a talented workforce; cost savings opportunities; the strategic benefit of expanding our presence in core and adjacent markets; and diversifying our product portfolio.
310764_14_ITEM8_P39_S0	The fair values of other identifiable intangible assets are primarily determined using the income approach.
310764_14_ITEM8_P39_S1	Other intangible assets include, but are not limited to, developed technology, customer and distributor relationships (which reflect expected continued customer or distributor patronage) and trademarks and patents.
310764_14_ITEM8_P40_S0	Intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 4 to 40 years.
310764_14_ITEM8_P40_S1	Certain acquired trade names are considered to have indefinite lives and are not amortized, but are assessed annually for potential impairment as described below.
310764_14_ITEM8_P41_S0	In certain of our acquisitions, we acquire in-process research and development (IPRD) intangible assets.
310764_14_ITEM8_P41_S1	IPRD is considered to be an indefinite-lived intangible asset until such time as the research is completed (at which time it becomes a determinable-lived intangible asset) or determined to have no future use (at which time it is impaired).
310764_14_ITEM8_P42_S0	Goodwill, Intangibles and Long-Lived Asset Impairment Tests: We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year.
310764_14_ITEM8_P42_S1	We consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill.
310764_14_ITEM8_P42_S2	In certain circumstances, we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability.
310764_14_ITEM8_P42_S3	Indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested at least annually for impairment by comparing the individual carrying values to the fair value.
310764_14_ITEM8_P42_S4	We review long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
310764_14_ITEM8_P42_S5	The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows.
310764_14_ITEM8_P42_S6	Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the asset's useful life based on updated projections.
310764_14_ITEM8_P42_S7	If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique.
310764_14_ITEM8_P43_S0	classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
310764_14_ITEM8_P44_S0	Stock Options: At December 31, 2013 , we had long-term incentive plans that are described more fully in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under which stock options are granted to key employees and non-employee directors.
310764_14_ITEM8_P44_S1	We measure the cost of employee stock options based on the grant-date fair value and recognize that cost using the straight-line method over the period during which a recipient is required to provide services in exchange for the options, typically the vesting period.
310764_14_ITEM8_P44_S2	The weighted-average fair value per share of options granted during 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, was $15.24 , $13.36 , and $17.14 , respectively.
310764_14_ITEM8_P44_S3	The fair value of options granted was estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:
310764_14_ITEM8_P45_S0	The risk-free interest rate for periods within the expected life of options granted is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
310764_14_ITEM8_P46_S0	Expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock.
310764_14_ITEM8_P46_S1	The expected option life, representing the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, is based on historical option exercise and employee termination data.
310764_14_ITEM8_P47_S0	Income Taxes: Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted income tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.
310764_14_ITEM8_P48_S0	Other amounts result from adjustments related to acquisitions as appropriate.
310764_14_ITEM8_P49_S0	We operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both within the United States and internationally.
310764_14_ITEM8_P49_S1	Accordingly, management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations.
310764_14_ITEM8_P49_S2	Income tax authorities in these jurisdictions regularly perform audits of our income tax filings.
310764_14_ITEM8_P49_S3	Income tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing, product royalty and foreign branch arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates.
310764_14_ITEM8_P50_S0	Legal and Other Contingencies: We are involved in various proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property and other matters that are more fully described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_14_ITEM8_P50_S1	The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time.
310764_14_ITEM8_P51_S0	In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory and equitable relief, that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief.
310764_14_ITEM8_P51_S1	For legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management s best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded.
310764_14_ITEM8_P51_S2	The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies.
310764_14_ITEM8_P52_S0	NOTE 2 - ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (AOCI) Changes in and reclassifications out of AOCI, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were:
310764_14_ITEM8_P53_S0	Items reclassified out of AOCI into earnings for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were:
310764_14_ITEM8_P54_S0	Amortization of defined benefit pension items:
310764_14_ITEM8_P55_S0	NOTE 3 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Accounting guidance on fair value measurements for certain financial assets and liabilities requires that financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
310764_14_ITEM8_P55_S1	Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
310764_14_ITEM8_P55_S2	Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity's own assumptions or external inputs from active markets.
310764_14_ITEM8_P56_S0	When applying fair value principles in the valuation of assets and liabilities, we are required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
310764_14_ITEM8_P57_S0	We calculate the fair value of our Level 1 and Level 2 instruments based on the exchange traded price of similar or identical instruments, where available, or based on other observable inputs.
310764_14_ITEM8_P57_S1	There were no significant transfers into or out of Level 1 or Level 2 that occurred between December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013.
310764_14_ITEM8_P58_S0	The fair value of our Level 3 assets and liabilities are calculated as the net present value of expected cash flows based on externally provided or obtained inputs.
310764_14_ITEM8_P58_S1	Certain Level 3 assets may also be based on sale prices of similar assets.
310764_14_ITEM8_P59_S0	Our fair value calculations take into consideration our credit risk and that of our counterparties.
310764_14_ITEM8_P59_S1	Should a counterparty default, our maximum exposure to loss is the asset balance of the instrument.
310764_14_ITEM8_P59_S2	We did not change our valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the year.
310764_14_ITEM8_P59_S3	Our valuation of our assets and liabilities measured at fair value at December 31, 2013 and 2012 :
310764_14_ITEM8_P60_S0	The following is a rollforward of our assets and liabilities measured at fair value using unobservable inputs (Level 3):
310764_14_ITEM8_P61_S0	The estimated fair value of the liability for contingent consideration represents milestone payments for acquisitions.
310764_14_ITEM8_P61_S1	The fair value of the liability was estimated using a discounted cash flow technique.
310764_14_ITEM8_P61_S2	Significant inputs to this technique included our probability assessments of occurrence of triggering events, appropriately discounted considering the uncertainties associated with the obligation.
310764_14_ITEM8_P61_S3	We remeasure this liability each reporting period and record the changes in the fair value in general and administrative expense (for probability of occurrence) and other income (expense) (for changes in time value of money) in earnings.
310764_14_ITEM8_P62_S0	The following presents quantitative information about the inputs and valuation methodologies we use for material fair value measurements classified in Level 3:
310764_14_ITEM8_P63_S0	The following is a summary of our marketable securities:
310764_14_ITEM8_P64_S0	The unrealized losses on our available-for-sale marketable securities were primarily caused by increases in yields as a result of changing conditions in the global credit markets.
310764_14_ITEM8_P64_S1	While some of these investments have been downgraded by rating agencies since their initial purchase, less than 1% of our investments in available-for-sale marketable securities had a credit quality rating of less than single A (per Standard Poors and Fitch) and A2 (per Moody's).
310764_14_ITEM8_P64_S2	Because we do not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, we do not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2013 .
310764_14_ITEM8_P65_S0	The cost and estimated fair value of available-for-sale marketable securities at December 31, 2013 by contractual maturity are:
310764_14_ITEM8_P66_S0	The gross unrealized losses and fair value of our investments with unrealized losses that are not deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, aggregated by investment category and length of time that the individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at December 31, 2013 , are as follows:
310764_14_ITEM8_P67_S0	Interest and marketable securities income totaled $24 , $47 and $34 in 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 , respectively, and is included in other income (expense).
310764_14_ITEM8_P68_S0	NOTE 4 - DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING STRATEGIES Our international activities expose us to the risks related to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
310764_14_ITEM8_P68_S1	We use operational and economic hedges as well as foreign currency exchange forward contracts to manage the impact of currency exchange on earnings and cash flow.
310764_14_ITEM8_P69_S0	At the inception of the forward contract, the derivative is designated as either a freestanding derivative or a cash flow hedge.
310764_14_ITEM8_P70_S0	We do not enter into currency exchange derivative instruments for speculative purposes.
310764_14_ITEM8_P70_S1	The gross notional amount of all currency exchange rate derivative instruments outstanding were $ 2,344 and $ 1,352 at December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
310764_14_ITEM8_P70_S2	The aggregate currency exchange rate gains (losses) were $3 , ($7) and ($3) for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 .
310764_14_ITEM8_P70_S3	These gains (losses) represent the net impact to the consolidated statement of earnings for the derivative instruments discussed below.
310764_14_ITEM8_P71_S0	We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on our outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our counterparties.
310764_14_ITEM8_P71_S1	Should a counterparty default, our maximum exposure to loss is the asset balance of the instrument.
310764_14_ITEM8_P72_S0	The maximum term of the forward currency exchange contracts at December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 546 days and 183 days.
310764_14_ITEM8_P73_S0	Derivative Instruments Not Designated as Hedges Derivative forward contracts are used to offset our exposure to the change in value of specific foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
310764_14_ITEM8_P73_S1	These derivatives are not designated as hedges, and therefore, changes in the value of these forward contracts are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related changes in value of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
310764_14_ITEM8_P74_S0	The estimated fair value of our forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points.
310764_14_ITEM8_P74_S1	The gross notional amount of all non-designated currency exchange rate derivative instruments outstanding were $ 2,000 and $ 1,352 at December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
310764_14_ITEM8_P74_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , recognized foreign currency transaction gains (losses) included in other income (expense) in earnings were ($6) , ($7) , and ($3) , respectively.
310764_14_ITEM8_P75_S0	In 2013 we implemented a layered hedging program to hedge select anticipated foreign currency cash flows to reduce volatility in both cash flows and reported earnings.
310764_14_ITEM8_P75_S1	These foreign exchange contracts generally have maturities up to eighteen months.
310764_14_ITEM8_P76_S0	For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of AOCI and reclassified into other income (expense) or cost of sales within earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
310764_14_ITEM8_P76_S1	In 2013 a gain of $9 was reclassified from AOCI to earnings relating to the discontinuance of certain cash flow hedges, as we now consider it probable that the original forecasted transactions will not occur.
310764_14_ITEM8_P76_S2	The gross notional amount of designated currency exchange rate derivative instruments outstanding were $344 at December 31, 2013 .
310764_14_ITEM8_P76_S3	Cash flows associated with these instruments are included in cash from operations in the same category as the cash flows from the items being hedged.
310764_14_ITEM8_P76_S4	The fair value amounts are presented on a gross basis in the balance sheet and are segregated between derivatives that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments and those that are not for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , as follows:
310764_14_ITEM8_P77_S0	Other Liabilities Noncurrent Derivatives designated as hedging instruments:

310764_14_ITEM8_P87_S0	The following is a summary of our other intangible assets:
310764_14_ITEM8_P88_S0	The estimated amortization expense for each of the next five years is as follows:
310764_14_ITEM8_P89_S0	NOTE 7 - CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS We are involved in various ongoing proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property, and other matters.
310764_14_ITEM8_P89_S1	The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time.
310764_14_ITEM8_P90_S0	In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory and equitable relief, that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief.
310764_14_ITEM8_P90_S1	For legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management's best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded.
310764_14_ITEM8_P90_S2	The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies.
310764_14_ITEM8_P90_S3	If actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results .
310764_14_ITEM8_P91_S0	The Company is currently self-insured for product liability-related claims and expenses.
310764_14_ITEM8_P91_S1	T he ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_14_ITEM8_P92_S0	In 2010 we received a subpoena from the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) related to the sales and marketing of the OtisKnee device.
310764_14_ITEM8_P92_S1	The subpoena concerns allegations of violations of federal laws related to sales of a device not cleared by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
310764_14_ITEM8_P92_S2	We continue to discuss the settlement of this matter with the DOJ, but there can be no assurance that we will reach a consensual resolution rather than seeking a resolution through the courts.
310764_14_ITEM8_P92_S3	We have recorded charges totaling $80 related to the above matter, including $47 in the year ended December 31, 2013.
310764_14_ITEM8_P93_S0	In June 2012 we voluntarily recalled our Rejuvenate and ABG II modular-neck hip stems and terminated global distribution of these hip products.
310764_14_ITEM8_P93_S1	We notified healthcare professionals and regulatory bodies of this recall, which was taken due to potential risks associated with fretting and/or corrosion that may lead to adverse local tissue reactions.
310764_14_ITEM8_P93_S2	Product liability lawsuits relating to this voluntary recall have been filed against us.
310764_14_ITEM8_P94_S0	As previously announced, we intend to reimburse implanted patients for reasonable and customary costs of testing and treatment services, including any necessary revision surgeries.

310764_14_ITEM8_P95_S1	Based on the information that has been received, the actuarially determined range of probable loss to resolve this matter is estimated to be approximately $790 to $1,235 , before third-party insurance recoveries.
310764_14_ITEM8_P95_S2	In the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded charges to earnings of $600 representing the excess of the $790 minimum of the range over the previously recorded reserves.
310764_14_ITEM8_P95_S3	No contingent gain for third-party insurance recoveries was recorded as of December 31, 2013.
310764_14_ITEM8_P96_S0	As noted above, the final outcome of this matter is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict.
310764_14_ITEM8_P96_S1	The ultimate cost to entirely resolve this matter may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_14_ITEM8_P97_S0	In 2010 we filed a lawsuit in federal court against Zimmer Holdings, Inc. (Zimmer), alleging that a Zimmer product infringed three of our patents.
310764_14_ITEM8_P97_S1	In rulings issued in August and September 2013, the trial judge upheld the February 2013 jury verdict in our favor, issued a permanent injunction barring Zimmer from making or selling infringing products, and ordered Zimmer to pay us at least $228 .
310764_14_ITEM8_P97_S2	Zimmer is appealing this ruling and the ultimate resolution of this matter may differ materially.
310764_14_ITEM8_P97_S3	Accordingly, we have not recorded a contingent gain related to this matter.
310764_14_ITEM8_P98_S0	For each of the following legal matters the final outcome is dependent on many variables and cannot be predicted.
310764_14_ITEM8_P98_S1	Accordingly, it is not possible at this time for us to estimate any material loss or range of losses.
310764_14_ITEM8_P98_S2	However, the ultimate cost to resolve these matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_14_ITEM8_P99_S0	In April 2011 lawsuits brought by Hill-Rom Company, Inc. and affiliated entities (Hill-Rom) against us were filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin and the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.
310764_14_ITEM8_P99_S1	The Wisconsin lawsuit was subsequently transferred to the United States District Court in Indiana.
310764_14_ITEM8_P100_S0	The suits allege infringement under United States patent laws with respect to certain patient handling equipment we manufactured and sold and seek damages and permanent injunctions.
310764_14_ITEM8_P100_S1	We have entered into an agreement settling the first lawsuit, with terms as previously disclosed.
310764_14_ITEM8_P101_S0	The second lawsuit involves nine patents related to electrical network communications for hospital beds.
310764_14_ITEM8_P101_S1	The case has been stayed with respect to six of the patents, which are currently under reexamination by the United States Patent Office.
310764_14_ITEM8_P101_S2	With respect to the three remaining patents, Hill-Rom is appealing the trial court's grant of summary judgment in our favor and the ultimate resolution of this particular part of the suit may differ.
310764_14_ITEM8_P101_S3	The ultimate resolution of the entire second suit may have no relation to the resolution of the first suit and cannot be predicted; however, the ultimate result could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_14_ITEM8_P102_S0	In 2010 we received a subpoena from the DOJ related to sales, marketing and regulatory matters related to the Stryker PainPump.

310764_14_ITEM8_P125_S1	During 2013 and 2012 , we issued 163,533 and 196,267 shares, respectively, under the ESPP.
310764_14_ITEM8_P126_S0	In 2013 , 2012 and 2011 we recorded $50 ( $2 in cost of sales and $48 in selling, general and administrative expense), $75 and $76 , respectively, in restructuring charges related to focused reductions of our global workforce and other restructuring initiatives.
310764_14_ITEM8_P126_S1	The targeted reductions and other restructuring activities were initiated to provide efficiencies and realign resources as well as to allow for continued investment in strategic areas and drive growth.
310764_14_ITEM8_P126_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 we recorded $22 and $40 , respectively, in severance and related costs and $25 and $32 , respectively, in contractual and other obligations, as certain of our restructuring actions resulted in the discontinued use of specific assets and the exit of certain lease and other commitments.
310764_14_ITEM8_P126_S3	In both 2013 and 2012 we also recorded $3 in agent conversion expense.
310764_14_ITEM8_P126_S4	Our current restructuring actions were completed at the end of 2013 , and we expect that the related cash payments will be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of 2014.
310764_14_ITEM8_P126_S5	A summary of our restructuring liability balance and full-year restructuring activity is as follows:
310764_14_ITEM8_P127_S0	NOTE 11 - INCOME TAXES Earnings before income taxes consisted of:
310764_14_ITEM8_P128_S0	In 2013 we recorded income tax benefits related to favorable audit resolutions in multiple jurisdictions.
310764_14_ITEM8_P129_S0	returns related to income tax positions we had taken for our cost sharing arrangements with two wholly-owned entities operating in Ireland, and we recorded charges for other uncertain tax positions related to the outcome of the IRS settlements.
310764_14_ITEM8_P129_S1	The net income tax benefit of these adjustments was $82 .
310764_14_ITEM8_P130_S0	Reconciliation of the United States federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate:
310764_14_ITEM8_P131_S0	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities:
310764_14_ITEM8_P132_S0	Net operating loss carryforwards totaling $377 at December 31, 2013 are available to reduce future taxable earnings of certain domestic and foreign subsidiaries.
310764_14_ITEM8_P132_S1	United States loss carryforwards of $270 expire between 2013 and 2032 .
310764_14_ITEM8_P132_S2	International loss carryforwards of $107 expire beginning in 2013 ; however, some have no expiration.
310764_14_ITEM8_P132_S3	Of these carryforwards, $55 are subject to a full valuation allowance.
310764_14_ITEM8_P132_S4	We also have a tax credit carryforward of $25 with a full valuation allowance.
310764_14_ITEM8_P132_S5	These credits have no expiration; however, we do not anticipate generating income tax in excess of the credits in the foreseeable future.
310764_14_ITEM8_P132_S6	No provision has been made for United States federal and state income taxes or international income taxes that may result from future remittances of the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are determined to be indefinitely reinvested ( $7,023 at December 31, 2013 ).
310764_14_ITEM8_P132_S7	Determination of the amount of any unrecognized deferred income tax liability on these is not practicable.
310764_14_ITEM8_P133_S0	The changes in the amounts recorded for uncertain income tax positions are as follows:
310764_14_ITEM8_P134_S0	Our income tax expense could have been reduced by $194 and $216 at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , respectively, had these uncertain income tax positions been favorably resolved.
310764_14_ITEM8_P134_S1	It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change due to one or more of the following events in the next twelve months: expiring statutes, audit activity, tax payments, competent authority proceedings related to transfer pricing or final decisions in matters that are the subject of controversy in various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing, product royalty and foreign branch arrangements.
310764_14_ITEM8_P134_S2	We are not able to reasonably estimate the amount or the future periods in which changes in unrecognized tax benefits may be resolved; however, we do not anticipate any significant changes within the next twelve months.
310764_14_ITEM8_P135_S0	Interest and penalties incurred associated with uncertain tax positions are included in other income (expense).
310764_14_ITEM8_P136_S0	In the normal course of business, income tax authorities in various income tax jurisdictions both within the United States and internationally conduct routine audits of our income tax returns filed in prior years.
310764_14_ITEM8_P136_S1	These audits are generally designed to determine if individual income tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretations of complex income tax regulations regarding the allocation of income to the various income tax jurisdictions.
310764_14_ITEM8_P136_S2	Income tax years are open from 2010 through the current year for the United States federal jurisdiction; income tax years open for our other major jurisdictions range from 2003 through the current year.
310764_14_ITEM8_P137_S0	NOTE 12 - RETIREMENT PLANS We provide certain employees with defined contribution plans.
310764_14_ITEM8_P137_S1	A portion of our retirement plan expense under the defined contribution plans is funded with Stryker common stock.
310764_14_ITEM8_P138_S0	The use of Stryker common stock represents a non-cash operating activity that is not reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
310764_14_ITEM8_P139_S0	Certain of our subsidiaries have both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans covering some or all of their employees.
310764_14_ITEM8_P139_S1	Substantially all of the defined benefit pension plans have projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets.
310764_14_ITEM8_P140_S0	The estimated net actuarial loss for the defined benefit pension plans to be reclassified from AOCI into net periodic benefit cost in the year ended 12/31/2014 is ($4) .
310764_14_ITEM8_P140_S1	We estimate that an immaterial amount of amortization of prior service cost and transition amount for the defined benefit pension plans will be reclassified from AOCI into net periodic benefit cost in the year ended 12/31/2014 .
310764_14_ITEM8_P141_S0	Pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets had projected benefit obligations, accumulated benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets of $456 , $427 , and $281 , respectively, at December 31, 2013 and $447 , $417 and $254 , respectively, at December 31, 2012.
310764_14_ITEM8_P142_S0	Discount rate The discount rates were selected using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds at December 31 that would provide the necessary cash flows to match our projected benefit payments.
310764_14_ITEM8_P143_S0	Expected return on plan assets The expected return on plan assets is determined by applying the target allocation in each asset category of plan investments to the anticipated return for each asset category based on historical and projected returns.
310764_14_ITEM8_P144_S0	The investment strategy for our defined benefit pension plans is to meet the liabilities of the plans as they fall due and to maximize the return on invested assets within appropriate risk tolerances.
310764_14_ITEM8_P145_S0	The weighted-average target and actual allocation of plan assets by asset category is as follows:
310764_14_ITEM8_P146_S0	Our Level 3 pension plan assets (See Note 3 for an explanation of our fair value hierarchy) consist primarily of guaranteed investment contracts with insurance companies.
310764_14_ITEM8_P146_S1	The insurance contracts guarantee us principal repayment and a fixed rate of return.
310764_14_ITEM8_P147_S0	Our valuation of Level 3 assets is based on third-party actuarial valuations that are an estimation of the surrender value of the guaranteed investment contract between us and the insurance company.
310764_14_ITEM8_P147_S1	The surrender value equals the actuarial value of the notional investments underlying the guaranteed investment contract, using the actuarial assumptions as stated in the guaranteed investment contract.
310764_14_ITEM8_P148_S0	We expect to contribute $20 to our defined benefit pension plans in 2014 .
310764_14_ITEM8_P148_S1	The estimated future benefit payments by year based on expected future service as appropriate are:
310764_14_ITEM8_P149_S0	NOTE 13 - SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA We segregate our operations into three reportable business segments: Reconstructive, MedSurg, and Neurotechnology and Spine.

310764_14_ITEM8_P151_S0	Our reportable segments are business units that offer different products and services and are managed separately because each business requires different manufacturing, technology and marketing strategies.
310764_14_ITEM8_P151_S1	The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_14_ITEM8_P151_S2	We measure the financial results of our reportable segments using an internal performance measure that excludes acquisition and integration-related charges, restructuring and related charges, reserves for certain product recall matters, reserves for certain legal and regulatory matters, a donation to an educational institution, and certain income tax adjustments.
310764_14_ITEM8_P152_S0	Identifiable assets are those assets used exclusively in the operations of each business segment or allocated when used jointly.
310764_14_ITEM8_P152_S1	Corporate assets are principally cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and property, plant and equipment.
310764_14_ITEM8_P152_S2	Results for our reportable segments are as follows:

310764_14_ITEM8_P153_S2	Net property, plant and equipment are based upon physical location of the assets.
310764_14_ITEM8_P154_S0	The price quotations reported above were supplied by the New York Stock Exchange.
310764_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures An evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2013 was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (the Certifying Officers).
310764_14_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on that evaluation, the Certifying Officers concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
310764_14_ITEM9A_P0_S2	There was no change to our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2013 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
310764_14_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The management of Stryker Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f).
310764_14_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Stryker Corporation s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company's management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
310764_14_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Stryker Corporation s management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 .
310764_14_ITEM9A_P1_S3	In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework .
310764_14_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Based on that assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.
310764_14_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The internal controls over financial reporting of an acquired business are eligible for a one year exclusion as permitted by Securities and Exchange Commission Staff interpretive guidance.
310764_14_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Accordingly, management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Trauson Holdings Company Limited and MAKO Surgical Corp., which are included in the December 31, 2013 consolidated financial statements of Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries.
310764_14_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Assets and shareholders' equity excluded from management's assessment constitute 2.3% and (0.2%) of total assets and shareholders' equity, respectively, as of December 31, 2013 and 0.7% and (3.2%) of revenues and net earnings, respectively, for the year then ended.
310764_14_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Stryker Corporation s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
310764_14_ITEM9A_P4_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF STRYKER CORPORATION:
310764_14_ITEM9A_P5_S0	We have audited Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) (the COSO criteria).
310764_14_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries' management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
310764_14_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
310764_14_ITEM9A_P5_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
310764_14_ITEM9A_P5_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
310764_14_ITEM9A_P5_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
310764_14_ITEM9A_P5_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
310764_14_ITEM9A_P6_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
310764_14_ITEM9A_P6_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
310764_14_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
310764_14_ITEM9A_P6_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
310764_14_ITEM9A_P7_S0	control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Trauson Holdings Company Limited and MAKO Surgical Corp., which are included in the December 31, 2013 consolidated financial statements of Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries and constituted 2.3% and (0.2%) of total assets and shareholders' equity, respectively, as of December 31, 2013 and 0.7% and (3.2%) of revenues and net earnings, respectively, for the year then ended.
310764_14_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Trauson Holdings Company Limited and MAKO Surgical Corp.
310764_14_ITEM9A_P7_S2	In our opinion, Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 , based on the COSO criteria.

310764_14_ITEM15_P39_S3	Alternatively, your Employer may withhold the minimum Tax-Related Items required to be withheld with respect to the Shares in cash from your regular salary and/or wages, or other amounts payable to you.

310764_14_ITEM15_P183_S1	Upon the grant of the RSUs, you shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived any such entitlement.

310764_15_ITEM1_P0_S0	General Stryker Corporation is one of the world's leading medical technology companies, with 2014 revenues of $9,675 and net earnings of $515 .

310764_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	Stryker was incorporated in Michigan in 1946 as the successor company to a business founded in 1941 by Dr. Homer H. Stryker, a prominent orthopaedic surgeon and the inventor of several orthopaedic products.
310764_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	In the United States, most of our products are marketed directly to doctors, hospitals and other healthcare facilities.
310764_15_ITEM1_P3_S1	Internationally, our products are sold in over 100 countries through company-owned sales subsidiaries and branches as well as third-party dealers and distributors.
310764_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	As used herein, and except where the context otherwise requires, "Stryker," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Stryker Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
310764_15_ITEM1_P4_S1	In December 2014 we changed the name of our Reconstructive business segment to Orthopaedics.
310764_15_ITEM1_P4_S2	This change did not change the composition of any of our business segments and had no financial impact.
310764_15_ITEM1_P4_S3	We segregate our reporting into three reportable business segments: Orthopaedics, MedSurg, and Neurotechnology and Spine.
310764_15_ITEM1_P4_S4	Financial information regarding our reportable business segments and certain geographic information is included under "Results of Operations" in Item 7 of this report and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.
310764_15_ITEM1_P4_S5	Net sales by reportable segment over the last three years were:
310764_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	Orthopaedics Orthopaedics products consist primarily of implants used in hip and knee joint replacements and trauma and extremities surgeries.
310764_15_ITEM1_P5_S1	We bring patients and physicians advanced implant designs and specialized instrumentation that make orthopaedic surgery and recovery simpler, faster and more effective.
310764_15_ITEM1_P5_S2	We support surgeons with the technology and services they need as they develop new surgical techniques.
310764_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	Stryker is one of five leading competitors globally for joint replacement and trauma products; the other four are Zimmer Holdings, Inc. (Zimmer), DePuy Synthes Company, a subsidiary of Johnson Johnson, Biomet, Inc. and Smith Nephew plc (Smith Nephew).
310764_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	The composition of net sales of Orthopaedics products over the last three years was:
310764_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	In September 2014 we acquired certain assets of Small Bone Innovations, Inc. (SBi) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $ 358 .

310764_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	In December 2013 we acquired MAKO Surgical Corp. (MAKO).
310764_15_ITEM1_P9_S1	The acquisition of MAKO, combined with our strong history in joint reconstruction, capital equipment (operating room integration and surgical navigation) and surgical instruments, will help further advance the growth of robotic arm assisted surgery.
310764_15_ITEM1_P9_S2	Our combined expertise offers the potential to simplify joint reconstruction procedures, reduce variability and enhance the surgeon and patient experience.
310764_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	In March 2013 we acquired Trauson Holdings Company Limited (Trauson).
310764_15_ITEM1_P10_S1	The acquisition of Trauson enhances our product offerings, primarily within our Orthopaedics segment, broadens our presence in China and enables us to expand into the fast growing value segment of the emerging markets.
310764_15_ITEM1_P10_S2	In 2013 we launched the Tritanium Cementless Baseplate for our Triathlon Knee Arthroscopy (TKA) system, which combines biologic fixation with Triathlon s kinematics to provide surgeons with a superior option for cementless TKA.
310764_15_ITEM1_P10_S3	We also launched the Secur-Fit Advanced Femoral Hip Stem, which facilitates the accurate restoration of biomechanics when used with our new and unique Stryker Orthopaedics Modeling and Analytics system.
310764_15_ITEM1_P10_S4	In 2012 we voluntarily recalled our Rejuvenate and ABG II Modular-Neck hip stems and terminated global distribution of these hip products.
310764_15_ITEM1_P10_S5	We notified healthcare professionals and regulatory bodies of this recall, which was taken due to potential risks associated with fretting and/or corrosion that may lead to adverse local tissue reactions.
310764_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	In November 2014 we entered into a Settlement Agreement (the Settlement Agreement ) to compensate eligible United States patients who had surgery to replace their Rejuvenate and ABG II modular-neck hip stems, known as a "revision surgery", prior to November 3, 2014.
310764_15_ITEM1_P11_S1	To date we have recorded charges to earnings totaling $1,534 ($1,713 before $179 of third party insurance recoveries) representing the actuarially determined low end of the range of probable loss to resolve this entire matter globally.
310764_15_ITEM1_P11_S2	It is expected that a majority of the payments under the Settlement Agreement will be made by the end of 2015.
310764_15_ITEM1_P11_S3	See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for further information.
310764_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	In 2012 we launched Accolade II, the first hip stem with a Morphometric Wedge design, an evolution of the tapered wedge stem.

310764_15_ITEM1_P17_S4	In March 2014 we acquired Patient Safety Technologies, Inc. (PST), for an aggregate purchase price of $120.
310764_15_ITEM1_P17_S5	PST conducts its business through its wholly owned subsidiary, SurgiCount Medical, Inc. PST s proprietary Safety-Sponge System and SurgiCount 360 compliance software help prevent Retained Foreign Objects in the operating room.
310764_15_ITEM1_P17_S6	Other business acquisitions in 2014 include the acquisition of Pivot Medical, Inc. (Pivot), which develops and sells innovative products for hip arthroscopy.
310764_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	In March 2013 we received a warning letter from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concerning quality system observations made during an inspection and citing us for failing to notify the FDA of a product recall and for marketing devices, including certain of our Neptune Waste Management Systems, without a required 510(k) clearance.
310764_15_ITEM1_P18_S1	We were notified in January 2014 that the actions taken to address issues raised in the warning letter were sufficient and no further corrective actions related to the warning letter were required.
310764_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	In December 2013 we received 510(k) clearance to market a modified Neptune 2 Waste Management System.
310764_15_ITEM1_P19_S1	The Neptune 2 Waste Management System mitigates risks to healthcare workers by eliminating harmful exposure to fluids and smoke in the operating room.
310764_15_ITEM1_P19_S2	This constantly closed system collects surgical waste and disposes of it without exposing the operator to contact with infectious fluids and surgical plumes.
310764_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	In 2012 we launched System 7, the next generation of heavy duty surgical power tools.
310764_15_ITEM1_P20_S1	These tools are used in total joint procedures, such as hip and knee replacements, and offer the latest in advanced cutting technology.
310764_15_ITEM1_P20_S2	We also launched the 1488 HD 3-Chip Endoscopic Camera System, which utilizes advanced CMOS technology and premium optics to provide a clear bright image designed to enhance patient outcomes.
310764_15_ITEM1_P20_S3	In addition, we launched Power-LOAD TM , our cot fastener system that lifts and lowers the cot into and out of ambulances, thereby reducing spinal loads and the risk of cumulative trauma injuries to emergency responders.

310764_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	In 2014 approximately 68.0% of our revenues were generated from customers in the United States.
310764_15_ITEM1_P24_S1	Additional geographic information is included under "Results of Operations" in Item 7 of this report and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.
310764_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	Raw Materials and Inventory Raw materials essential to our business are generally readily available from multiple sources.
310764_15_ITEM1_P25_S1	Substantially all products we manufacture are stocked in inventory, while certain MedSurg products are assembled to order.
310764_15_ITEM1_P25_S2	The dollar amount of backlog orders at any given time is not considered material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole.
310764_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	Patents and Trademarks Patents and trademarks are significant to our business to the extent that a product or an attribute of a product represents a unique design or process.
310764_15_ITEM1_P26_S1	Patent protection of such products restricts competitors from duplicating these unique designs and features.
310764_15_ITEM1_P26_S2	We seek to obtain patent protection on our products whenever appropriate for protecting our competitive advantage.
310764_15_ITEM1_P26_S3	As of December 31, 2014 we owned approximately 1,900 United States patents and approximately 3,400 international patents.
310764_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	Seasonality Our business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of Orthopaedics implant surgeries is generally lower during the summer months and sales of capital equipment are generally higher in the fourth quarter.
310764_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	Competition In all of our product lines we compete with local and global companies located throughout the world.
310764_15_ITEM1_P29_S1	Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved.
310764_15_ITEM1_P29_S2	The development of new and innovative products is important to our success in all areas of our business and competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant.
310764_15_ITEM1_P29_S3	The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and in maintaining sales forces.
310764_15_ITEM1_P29_S4	The principal factors that we believe differentiate us in the highly competitive product categories in which we operate and enable us to compete effectively include our commitment to innovation and quality, service and reputation.
310764_15_ITEM1_P29_S5	We believe that our competitive position in the future will depend to a large degree on our ability to develop new products and make improvements to existing products.
310764_15_ITEM1_P29_S6	Product Development Most of our products and product improvements have been developed internally at research facilities in the United States, Ireland, Puerto Rico, Germany, Switzerland, India and France.
310764_15_ITEM1_P29_S7	We also invest through acquisitions in technologies developed by third parties that have the potential to expand the markets in which we operate.
310764_15_ITEM1_P29_S8	We maintain close working relationships with physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist us in product development efforts.

310764_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	Our businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation.
310764_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	In the United States, the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its subsequent amendments, and the regulations issued and proposed thereunder, provide for regulation by the FDA of the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices, including most of our products.
310764_15_ITEM1_P31_S1	Many of our new products fall into FDA classifications that require notification submitted as a 510(k) and review by the FDA before we begin marketing them.
310764_15_ITEM1_P31_S2	Certain of our products require extensive clinical testing, consisting of safety and efficacy studies, followed by pre-market approval (PMA) applications for specific surgical indications.
310764_15_ITEM1_P31_S3	The FDA's Quality System regulations set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the FDA.
310764_15_ITEM1_P31_S4	There are also certain requirements of state and local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the manufacture and marketing of our products.
310764_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	The member states of the European Union (EU) have adopted the European Medical Device Directives that form a single set of medical device regulations for all EU member countries.
310764_15_ITEM1_P32_S1	These regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member countries to meet certain quality system requirements and obtain CE marking for their products.
310764_15_ITEM1_P32_S2	We have authorization to apply the CE marking to substantially all of our products.
310764_15_ITEM1_P32_S3	In addition, we comply with the unique regulatory requirements of each of the countries in Europe and other countries in which we market our products.
310764_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	generally and hospital costs in particular, including price regulation and competitive pricing, are ongoing in markets where we do business.
310764_15_ITEM1_P33_S1	It is not possible to predict at this time the long-term impact of such cost containment measures on our future business.
310764_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	In addition, business practices in the healthcare industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the United States, by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.
310764_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	Employees At December 31, 2014 , we had approximately 26,000 employees worldwide.
310764_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	Certain international employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
310764_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	We believe that we maintain positive relationships with our employees worldwide.

310764_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	This report contains statements referring to us that are not historical facts and are considered "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These statements, which are intended to take advantage of the "safe harbor" provisions of the Reform Act, are based on current projections about operations, industry conditions, financial condition and liquidity.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Words that identify forward-looking statements include words such as "may," "could," "will," "should," "possible," "plan," "predict," "forecast," "potential," "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "believe," "may impact," "on track," and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance, an acquisition or our businesses.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P0_S3	In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Those statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P0_S5	Therefore, actual results could differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P0_S6	Some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forward-looking statements include the risks discussed below.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	The impact of United States healthcare reform legislation on our business remains uncertain.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	In 2010 federal legislation to reform the United States healthcare system was enacted into law.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The legislation is far-reaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage and improve the quality and reduce the costs of healthcare over time.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Its provisions become effective at various dates and there are many programs and requirements for which the details have not been determined.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P2_S3	We expect the law will have a significant impact upon various aspects of our business operations.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	excise tax on Class I, II and III medical devices that applies to United States sales of a majority of our medical device products.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Other provisions of this legislation, including Medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs, comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies, could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Further, we cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will be ultimately implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the United States on our business and results of operations We may be adversely affected by product liability claims, unfavorable court decisions or legal settlements.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices, many of which are intended to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We are currently defendants in a number of product liability matters, including those relating to our Rejuvenate and ABGII Modular-Neck hip stems discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	These matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P4_S3	In addition, we may incur significant legal expenses regardless of whether we are found to be liable.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P4_S4	We are currently self-insured for product liability-related claims and expenses.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P4_S5	The ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P4_S6	Intellectual property litigation and infringement claims could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling certain of our products.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The medical device industry is characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation and, from time to time, we are the subject of claims by third parties of potential infringement or misappropriation.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Regardless of outcome, such claims are expensive to defend and divert the time and effort of management and operating personnel from other business issues.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P5_S2	A successful claim or claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments or negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products in the affected category.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Dependence on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to such rights may impact offerings in our product portfolios.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our long-term success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	If we fail to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property protection, such a failure could allow others to sell products that compete with offerings in our product portfolio.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Also, our issued patents are subject to claims concerning priority, scope and other issues, and currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to the manufacturing, labeling and marketing of our products.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Substantially all of our products are subject to regulation by the FDA and other governmental authorities in the United States and internationally.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis, if at all.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P7_S3	We have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations with respect to our products and facilities and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA to determine compliance with the quality system and medical device reporting regulations and other requirements.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	warning letters, product recalls, the suspension of product manufacturing, monetary fines and criminal prosecution.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We are subject to federal, state and foreign healthcare regulations, including fraud and abuse laws, as well as anti-bribery laws, and could face substantial penalties if we fail to fully comply with such regulations and laws.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Our relationship with healthcare professionals, such as physicians, hospitals and those that may market our products, are subject to scrutiny under various state and federal laws often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P9_S3	In addition, the United States and foreign government regulators have increased the enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P9_S4	These laws are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation, which could require us to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if we are found not to be in compliance.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P9_S5	We also must comply with a variety of other laws which protect the privacy of individually identifiable healthcare information and impose extensive tracking and reporting related to all transfers of value provided to certain healthcare professionals.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P9_S6	Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	MARKET RISKS Macroeconomic developments could negatively affect our ability to conduct business in affected regions.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Financial difficulties experienced by our customers, including distributors, and suppliers could result in product delays and inventory issues; risks to accounts receivable could also include delays in collection and greater bad debt expense.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross border transactions and translation of local currency results into United States dollars.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P10_S3	We report our financial results in United States Dollars and approximately one-third of our revenues are denominated in foreign currencies, including the Euro, the British Pound, and the Japanese Yen.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Cross border transactions, both with external parties and intercompany relationships, result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Our results of operations and, in some cases, cash flows, have been and may in the future be adversely affected by movements in foreign exchange rates.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P11_S2	While we implement currency hedges to partially reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates; our hedging strategies may not be successful, and our unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P11_S3	In addition, the weakening or strengthening of the United States dollar results in favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the results of our foreign locations are translated into United States dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements and results.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P11_S4	BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL RISKS Cost containment measures in the United States and other countries resulting in pricing pressures could have a negative impact on our future operating results.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Initiatives sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation and competitive pricing, are ongoing in markets where we do business.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P11_S6	Pricing pressure has also increased in our markets due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers, trends toward managed care, the shift towards governments becoming the primary payers of healthcare expenses, and government laws and regulations relating to sales and promotion, reimbursement and pricing generally.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P11_S7	Reductions in reimbursement levels or coverage for our products or other cost containment measures, including any that reduce medical procedure volumes, could unfavorably affect our future operating results.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We may be unable to effectively develop and market products against the products of our competitors in a highly competitive industry.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by our competitors.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Competitive factors include price, customer service, technology, innovation, quality, reputation and reliability.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Our competition may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, have greater financial, marketing and other resources or be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees and strategic partners.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Given these factors, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue our level of success in the industry.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Competition in the development and improvement of new and existing products is particularly significant and results from time to time in product obsolescence.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Such marketplace changes may cause some of our products to become obsolete.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P13_S3	If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, a higher level of inventory write downs may result.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We may be unable to maintain adequate working relationships with healthcare professionals.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We seek to maintain close working relationships with respected physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist in product research and development.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P14_S2	We rely on these professionals to assist us in the development of proprietary products and product improvements to complement and expand our existing product lines.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P14_S3	If we are unable to maintain these relationships, our ability to develop, market and sell new and improved products could decrease.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P14_S4	We are subject to additional risks associated with our extensive international operations.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P14_S5	We develop, manufacture and distribute our products throughout the world.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Our international operations are subject to a number of additional risks and potential costs, including changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs, unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements, differing local product preferences and product requirements, diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations, political and economic instability.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P14_S7	Our results of operations and/or financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks of international operations in an increasingly volatile environment.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P14_S8	We may be unable to capitalize on previous or future acquisitions.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P14_S9	In addition to internally developed products, we rely upon investment in new technologies through acquisitions.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P14_S10	Investments in medical technology are inherently risky, and we cannot guarantee that any acquisition will be successful or will not have a material unfavorable impact on us.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P14_S11	These risks include the activities required to integrate new businesses, which may result in the need to allocate more resources to integration and product development activities than originally anticipated, diversion of management time, which could adversely affect management's ability to focus on other projects, the inability to realize the expected benefits, savings or synergies from the acquisition, the loss of key personnel of the acquired company, and exposure to unexpected liabilities of the acquired company.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P14_S12	In addition, we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so, which may result in unexpected impairment charges.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We may record future goodwill impairment charges related to one or more of our business units, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P16_S2	In evaluating the potential for impairment we make assumptions regarding revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows, tax rates, and discount rates.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P16_S3	These assumptions are uncertain and by nature may vary from actual results.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P16_S4	A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our results of operations.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P16_S5	Our results of operations could be negatively impacted by future changes in the allocation of income to each of the income tax jurisdictions in which we operate.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both in the United States and internationally.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Accordingly, our management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each jurisdiction based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Income tax authorities regularly perform audits of our income tax filings.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Income tax audits associated with the allocation of income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing, product royalty and foreign branch arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P17_S4	If changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates, the related adjustments could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Failure of a key information technology system, process or site could have a material adverse impact on our business.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We rely extensively on information technology systems to conduct business.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	These systems include, but are not limited to, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping products to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, providing data security and other processes necessary to manage our business.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	If our systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively compensate on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our operations.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P18_S3	A breach of information security, including a cybersecurity breach or failure of one or more key information technology systems, networks, processes, associated sites or service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We rely extensively on information technology (IT) systems, networks and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third-parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced persistent threats, pose a potential risk to the security of our IT systems, networks and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability, integrity of our data and our responsibilities to governments.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We have made investments seeking to address these threats, including monitoring of networks and systems, hiring of experts, employee training and security policies for employees and third-party providers.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P19_S3	However, because the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	our third-party providers suffer a loss or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The costs and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We may be unable to attract and retain key employees.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Our sales, technical and other key personnel play an integral role in the development, marketing and selling of new and existing products.
310764_15_ITEM1A_P20_S4	If we are unable to recruit, hire, develop and retain a talented, competitive work force, we may not be able to meet our strategic business objectives.
310764_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	The following are our principal manufacturing locations as of December 31, 2014 :
310764_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	Our corporate headquarters is located in Kalamazoo, Michigan, in a 75,000 square foot owned facility.
310764_15_ITEM2_P1_S1	In addition, we maintain administrative and sales offices and warehousing and distribution facilities in multiple countries.
310764_15_ITEM2_P1_S2	We believe that our properties are suitable and adequate for the manufacture and distribution of our products.
310764_15_ITEM2_P2_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are involved in various proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property, and other matters that are more fully described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report; this information is incorporated herein by reference.
310764_15_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SYK.
310764_15_ITEM5_P0_S1	Quarterly stock price and dividend information for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:
310764_15_ITEM5_P1_S0	Our Board of Directors considers payment of cash dividends at each of its quarterly meetings.
310764_15_ITEM5_P1_S1	On January 31, 2015 , there were 3,285 shareholders of record of our common stock.
310764_15_ITEM5_P2_S0	In December of 2012 and 2011, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized us to purchase up to $405 and $500, respectively, of our common stock (the 2012 and 2011 Repurchase Programs, respectively).
310764_15_ITEM5_P2_S1	The manner, timing and amount of purchases is determined by management based on an evaluation of market conditions, stock price and other factors and is subject to regulatory considerations.
310764_15_ITEM5_P2_S2	Purchases are to be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.

310764_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	(1) Non-GAAP Financial Measures We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including percentage sales growth in constant currency; percentage organic sales growth; adjusted gross profit; cost of sales excluding specified items; adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses; adjusted amortization of intangible assets; adjusted operating income; adjusted effective income tax rate; adjusted net earnings; and adjusted diluted net earnings per share (EPS).
310764_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance.
310764_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	Management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses.
310764_15_ITEM7_P21_S2	Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these non-GAAP financial measures.
310764_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales.
310764_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	Percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates.
310764_15_ITEM7_P22_S2	To measure percentage organic sales growth, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions that affect the comparability and trend of sales.
310764_15_ITEM7_P22_S3	Percentage organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates excluding the impact of acquisitions.
310764_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	To measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings.
310764_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	These adjustments are irregular in timing, may not be indicative of our past and future performance and are therefore excluded to allow investors to better understand underlying operating trends.
310764_15_ITEM7_P23_S2	The following are examples of the types of adjustments that may be included in a period: 1. Acquisition and integration related costs .
310764_15_ITEM7_P23_S3	Costs related to integrating recently acquired businesses and specific costs related to the consummation of the acquisition process.
310764_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	2. Amortization of intangible assets .
310764_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	Periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets.
310764_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	Costs associated with focused workforce reductions, other restructuring activities and long-lived asset impairments.
310764_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	Our best estimate of the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve certain product recalls.
310764_15_ITEM7_P26_S2	Our best estimate of the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve certain regulatory matters and other legal settlements.
310764_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	Certain significant and discrete tax items and adjustments to interest expense related to the settlement of certain tax matters.
310764_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names.
310764_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth, gross profit, cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, amortization of intangible assets, operating income, effective income tax rate, net earnings and diluted net earnings per share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
310764_15_ITEM7_P28_S2	These non-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures at the end of the discussion of Results of Operations below, provide a more complete understanding of our business.
310764_15_ITEM7_P28_S3	We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.
310764_15_ITEM7_P28_S4	The following reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted gross profit; adjusted selling, general and administrative expense; adjusted operating income; adjusted other income/(expense); adjusted net earnings; adjusted effective tax rate; and adjusted diluted net earnings per share; with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures:
310764_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	The weighted-average basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures are the same as the weighted-average shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported per share amounts.
310764_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	We believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and ready access to capital markets at competitive rates.
310764_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures.
310764_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	Excess operating cash is used first to fund acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses.
310764_15_ITEM7_P32_S2	Other discretionary uses include dividends and share repurchases.
310764_15_ITEM7_P32_S3	As necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities.
310764_15_ITEM7_P32_S4	Our overall cash position shows our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.
310764_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	Operating Activities Operating cash flow was $1,782 in 2014 , a decrease of 5.5% and resulted primarily from net earnings adjusted for non-cash items (recall charges, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, sale of inventory "stepped up" to fair value at acquisition and deferred income taxes).
310764_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	In addition, the increase in taxes payable was primarily due to the timing of tax payments associated with tax liabilities arising from the establishment of a European regional headquarters.
310764_15_ITEM7_P33_S2	These increases were partially offset by higher levels of inventory and accounts receivable.
310764_15_ITEM7_P33_S3	The net of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable resulted in the consumption of $249 of cash in 2014 .
310764_15_ITEM7_P33_S4	Inventory days on hand increased by eight days compared to 2013 as inventory grew to support higher sales and acquisitions, while accounts receivable days sales outstanding decreased by one day compared to 2013.
310764_15_ITEM7_P33_S5	Operating cash flow was $1,886 in 2013, an increase of 13.8%, and resulted primarily from net earnings adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, sale of inventory "stepped up" to fair value at acquisition and deferred income taxes), along with a decrease of $278 in cash paid for income taxes, associated with the timing of cash payments as well as favorable tax audit resolutions in multiple jurisdictions.
310764_15_ITEM7_P33_S6	The net of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable consumed $165 of cash in 2013.
310764_15_ITEM7_P33_S7	Inventory days on hand improved by 1 day due to continued focus on improved inventory management; accounts receivable days sales outstanding remained consistent with 2012.

310764_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and overall cost of capital.
310764_15_ITEM7_P36_S1	Net proceeds from borrowings were $1,159 and $1,005 in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
310764_15_ITEM7_P36_S2	In 2014 the proceeds were primarily from the public offerings of notes and commercial paper, and proceeds in 2013 were primarily from public offerings of notes.
310764_15_ITEM7_P36_S3	Refer to Note 8 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
310764_15_ITEM7_P36_S4	Total debt was $3,973 and $2,764 in 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
310764_15_ITEM7_P36_S5	The total use of cash for share repurchases was $100, $317 and $108 in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
310764_15_ITEM7_P36_S6	Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $5,000 and $3,980 at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, and our current assets exceeded current liabilities by $5,209 and $5,678 at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
310764_15_ITEM7_P36_S7	We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs, including settlements related to the Rejuvenate and ABG II recalls, from a variety of sources, including cash from operations, commercial paper and existing credit lines.
310764_15_ITEM7_P36_S8	In the past we have also raised funds in the capital markets and may continue to do so from time to time in the future.
310764_15_ITEM7_P36_S9	We have strong short-term and long-term debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due.
310764_15_ITEM7_P36_S10	Should additional funds be required we had approximately $1,289 of borrowing capacity available under all of our existing credit facilities at December 31, 2014 .
310764_15_ITEM7_P36_S11	At December 31, 2014 , approximately 68% of our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held outside of the United States.
310764_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	that we plan to repatriate approximately $2,000 in total of cash from outside of the United States in 2015.
310764_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	The remainder of the funds outside of the United States are considered indefinitely reinvested to be used to expand operations either organically or through acquisitions outside the United States.
310764_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	We continually evaluate our receivables, particularly in Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece (the Southern European Region).
310764_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	The total net receivables from the Southern European Region were approximately $154 and $199 at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, including approximately $78 and $103 of sovereign receivables in 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
310764_15_ITEM7_P39_S2	We believe that our current reserves related to receivables are adequate and any additional credit risk associated with the Southern European Region is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial position or liquidity.
310764_15_ITEM7_P39_S3	We currently do not have any investments in the sovereign debt instruments of the Southern European Region.
310764_15_ITEM7_P39_S4	Any non-sovereign exposure in these countries in our investment portfolio is considered immaterial.
310764_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	We do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.
310764_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND FORWARD-LOOKING CASH REQUIREMENTS As further described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2014 we have recorded charges to earnings totaling $748 representing the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve the Rejuvenate and ABG II recalls.
310764_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	Based on the information that has been received, the actuarially determined range of probable loss to resolve this matter is estimated to be approximately $1,534 ($1,713 before $179 of third-party insurance recoveries) to $2,453.
310764_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	The final outcome of this matter is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict.
310764_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	The ultimate cost to entirely resolve this matter may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	We are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which payments will be made.
310764_15_ITEM7_P43_S1	As further described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2014 our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by $260, of which approximately $250 related to plans outside the United States.
310764_15_ITEM7_P43_S2	Due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and potential changes in legislation in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, we are not able to reasonably estimate, beyond 2014, the amounts that may be required to fund defined benefit pension plans.
310764_15_ITEM7_P43_S3	As further described in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2014 we have recorded a liability for uncertain income tax positions of $315.
310764_15_ITEM7_P43_S4	Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits, we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which any income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made.
310764_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	Our future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than one year, including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business, are:
310764_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES In preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application.
310764_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	These include inventory reserves, income taxes, acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets, and legal and other contingencies.
310764_15_ITEM7_P45_S2	We believe these accounting policies and the others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition.
310764_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	We maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs.
310764_15_ITEM7_P46_S1	We make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends.
310764_15_ITEM7_P46_S2	If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.
310764_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	Income Taxes Our annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes.
310764_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements.
310764_15_ITEM7_P48_S1	Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense.
310764_15_ITEM7_P48_S2	These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.
310764_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement.
310764_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred, the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction has already been taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment.
310764_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes.
310764_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	Realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods.
310764_15_ITEM7_P51_S1	Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.
310764_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments.
310764_15_ITEM7_P53_S1	In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority.
310764_15_ITEM7_P53_S2	These differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment.
310764_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes.
310764_15_ITEM7_P54_S1	We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly.
310764_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions.
310764_15_ITEM7_P55_S1	Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
310764_15_ITEM7_P55_S2	Because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events, such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans, could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate.
310764_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	Acquisitions, Goodwill and Intangibles, and Long-Lived Assets We account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting.
310764_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	Under the purchase method, our financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition.
310764_15_ITEM7_P56_S2	In addition, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill.
310764_15_ITEM7_P56_S3	Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives.
310764_15_ITEM7_P56_S4	Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant items.
310764_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain.
310764_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets.
310764_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.
310764_15_ITEM7_P58_S2	Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.
310764_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment.
310764_15_ITEM7_P59_S1	With the exception of certain trade names, the majority of our acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer and distributor relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives.
310764_15_ITEM7_P59_S2	Our assessment as to the useful lives of these intangible assets is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, trademark and/or brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarks or brands are sold.
310764_15_ITEM7_P59_S3	Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors.
310764_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life.
310764_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	In certain of our acquisitions, we acquire in-process research and development (IPRD) intangible assets.
310764_15_ITEM7_P61_S1	IPRD is considered to be an indefinite-lived intangible asset until such time as the research is completed (at which time it becomes a determinable-lived intangible asset) or determined to have no future use (at which time it is impaired).
310764_15_ITEM7_P61_S2	The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment.
310764_15_ITEM7_P61_S3	Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles.
310764_15_ITEM7_P61_S4	We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year.
310764_15_ITEM7_P61_S5	We have adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-08, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other: Testing Goodwill for Impairment , which permits us to consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill.
310764_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	In certain circumstances, we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability.
310764_15_ITEM7_P62_S1	In those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level.
310764_15_ITEM7_P62_S2	We test individual indefinite-lived intangibles by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value.
310764_15_ITEM7_P62_S3	We determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the income approach.
310764_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows.
310764_15_ITEM7_P63_S1	Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value.
310764_15_ITEM7_P63_S2	Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans.
310764_15_ITEM7_P63_S3	We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants.
310764_15_ITEM7_P63_S4	We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill during the years presented, as our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill fair values exceeded their respective recorded values.
310764_15_ITEM7_P63_S5	Future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates and future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values.
310764_15_ITEM7_P63_S6	A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our financial statements.
310764_15_ITEM7_P63_S7	We review our other long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
310764_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level.
310764_15_ITEM7_P64_S1	The undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections.
310764_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique.
310764_15_ITEM7_P65_S1	Assets classified as held for sale, if any, are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
310764_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time.
310764_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory and equitable relief, that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief.
310764_15_ITEM7_P68_S1	For legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management's best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded.
310764_15_ITEM7_P68_S2	The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies.
310764_15_ITEM7_P68_S3	If actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.
310764_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	We are currently self-insured for product liability-related claims and expenses.
310764_15_ITEM7_P69_S1	The ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In May 2014 the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes and replaces nearly all currently-existing guidance under United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles related to revenue recognition including related disclosure requirements.
310764_15_ITEM7_P70_S1	This guidance will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2017.
310764_15_ITEM7_P70_S2	We have not yet completed an assessment of the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.
310764_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	We sell our products throughout the world.
310764_15_ITEM7_P71_S1	As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak economic conditions or changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
310764_15_ITEM7_P71_S2	Our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the United States dollar; European currencies, in particular the euro, Swiss franc and the British pound; the Japanese yen; the Australian dollar; and the Canadian dollar.
310764_15_ITEM7_P71_S3	We develop and manufacture products in the United States, China, France, Germany, Ireland, Puerto Rico and Switzerland and incur costs in the applicable local currencies.
310764_15_ITEM7_P71_S4	This worldwide deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on our cost of sales.
310764_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	We enter into designated and non-designated forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates.
310764_15_ITEM7_P72_S1	These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products.
310764_15_ITEM7_P72_S2	The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies.
310764_15_ITEM7_P72_S3	All forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period, with resulting gains (losses) for non-designated forward contracts and any ineffectiveness measured on designated forward currency exchange contracts included in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
310764_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	comprehensive income, and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
310764_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points.
310764_15_ITEM7_P74_S1	A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar would change the December 31, 2014 fair value by approximately $79.
310764_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on our outstanding forward currency exchange contracts, but we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our counterparties.
310764_15_ITEM7_P76_S0	We have certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged.
310764_15_ITEM7_P76_S1	These investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
310764_15_ITEM7_P76_S2	For 2014 the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar increased the value of these investments in net assets and the related foreign currency translation adjustment loss in shareholders' equity by $(440) to $(134), from $306 as of December 31, 2013.
310764_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We consider our material area of market risk exposure to be exchange rate risk.

310764_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Stryker Corporation :
310764_15_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , and the related consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 .
310764_15_ITEM8_P1_S1	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a).
310764_15_ITEM8_P1_S2	These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.
310764_15_ITEM8_P1_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
310764_15_ITEM8_P2_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
310764_15_ITEM8_P2_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
310764_15_ITEM8_P3_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
310764_15_ITEM8_P3_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
310764_15_ITEM8_P3_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
310764_15_ITEM8_P4_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

310764_15_ITEM8_P16_S1	These estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future.
310764_15_ITEM8_P16_S2	Estimates are used in accounting for, among other items, pensions, stock options, valuation of acquired intangible assets, useful lives for depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets, excess and obsolete inventory, deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain income tax positions and contingencies.
310764_15_ITEM8_P16_S3	Actual results may ultimately differ from estimates.
310764_15_ITEM8_P17_S0	Sales are recognized when revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned.
310764_15_ITEM8_P17_S1	Our policy is to recognize revenue when title to the product, ownership and risk of loss transfer to the customer, which can be on the date of shipment, the date of receipt by the customer or, for most orthopaedics products, when we receive appropriate notification that the product has been used or implanted.
310764_15_ITEM8_P17_S2	A provision for estimated sales returns, discounts, rebates and other sales incentives is recorded as a reduction of net sales in the same period that the revenue is recognized.
310764_15_ITEM8_P17_S3	Shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in net sales.
310764_15_ITEM8_P18_S0	Cost of Sales: Cost of sales is primarily comprised of direct materials and supplies consumed in the manufacture of product, as well as manufacturing labor, depreciation expense and direct overhead expense necessary to acquire and convert the purchased materials and supplies into finished product.
310764_15_ITEM8_P18_S1	Cost of sales also includes the cost to distribute products to customers, inbound freight costs, warehousing costs and other shipping and handling activity.
310764_15_ITEM8_P19_S0	Research, Development and Engineering Expenses: Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred.
310764_15_ITEM8_P19_S1	Costs include research, development and engineering activities relating to the development of new products, improvement of existing products, technical support of products and compliance with governmental regulations for the protection of customers and patients.
310764_15_ITEM8_P19_S2	Costs primarily consist of salaries, wages, consulting and depreciation and maintenance of research facilities and equipment.
310764_15_ITEM8_P20_S0	depreciation and amortization expense of non-manufacturing assets and other miscellaneous operating items.
310764_15_ITEM8_P21_S0	Currency Translation: Financial statements of subsidiaries outside the United States generally are measured using the local currency as the functional currency.
310764_15_ITEM8_P21_S1	Adjustments to translate those statements into United States dollars are recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI).
310764_15_ITEM8_P22_S0	Transactional exchange gains and losses are included in earnings.
310764_15_ITEM8_P23_S0	Cash Equivalents: Highly liquid investments with remaining stated maturities of three months or less when purchased are considered cash equivalents and recorded at cost.
310764_15_ITEM8_P24_S0	Marketable Securities: Marketable securities consist of marketable debt securities, certificates of deposit and mutual funds.
310764_15_ITEM8_P24_S1	Mutual funds are acquired to offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements and are expected to be used to settle these liabilities.
310764_15_ITEM8_P25_S0	Pursuant to our investment policy, all individual marketable security investments must have a minimum credit quality of single A (per Standard Poor s and Fitch) and A2 (per Moody s Corporation) at the time of acquisition, while the overall portfolio of marketable securities must maintain a minimum average credit quality of double A (per Standard Poor s and Fitch) or Aa (per Moody s Corporation).
310764_15_ITEM8_P25_S1	In the event of a rating downgrade below the minimum credit quality subsequent to purchase, the marketable security investment is evaluated to determine the appropriate action to take to minimize the overall risk to our marketable security investment portfolio.
310764_15_ITEM8_P26_S0	Our marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and trading securities.
310764_15_ITEM8_P27_S0	Accounts receivable consists of trade and other miscellaneous receivables.
310764_15_ITEM8_P27_S1	An allowance is maintained for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable.
310764_15_ITEM8_P27_S2	Estimates are made regarding the ability of customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends.
310764_15_ITEM8_P27_S3	Accounts receivable are written off when all reasonable collection efforts are exhausted.
310764_15_ITEM8_P28_S0	Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost generally determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method.
310764_15_ITEM8_P29_S0	For excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell specific products at prices in excess of current carrying costs, reserves are maintained to reduce current carrying cost to market prices.
310764_15_ITEM8_P30_S0	Financial Instruments: Our financial instruments consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, other investments, accounts payable, debt and foreign currency exchange contracts.
310764_15_ITEM8_P30_S1	With the exception of our long-term debt, which is discussed in further detail in Note 8, our estimates of fair value for financial instruments approximate their carrying amounts as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
310764_15_ITEM8_P31_S0	All marketable securities are recognized at fair value.
310764_15_ITEM8_P31_S1	Adjustments to the fair value of marketable securities that are classified as available-for-sale are recorded as increases or decreases, net of income taxes, within accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) in shareholders equity and adjustments to the fair value of marketable securities that are classified as trading are recorded in earnings.
310764_15_ITEM8_P32_S0	The amortized cost of marketable debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity computed under the effective interest method.
310764_15_ITEM8_P32_S1	Such amortization is included in other income (expense) along with interest and realized gains and losses.
310764_15_ITEM8_P33_S0	The cost of securities sold is determined by the specific identification method.
310764_15_ITEM8_P34_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_15_ITEM8_P35_S0	We review declines in the fair value of our investments classified as available-for-sale for impairment to determine whether the decline in fair value is an other-than-temporary impairment.
310764_15_ITEM8_P35_S1	The resulting losses from other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale marketable securities are included in earnings.
310764_15_ITEM8_P36_S0	Derivatives: All derivatives are recognized at fair value and reported on a gross basis.
310764_15_ITEM8_P37_S0	We enter into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting our risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates.
310764_15_ITEM8_P37_S1	These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products.
310764_15_ITEM8_P37_S2	The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies.
310764_15_ITEM8_P37_S3	All forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period, with resulting gains (losses) included in earnings.
310764_15_ITEM8_P38_S0	Forward currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are designed to hedge the variability of cash flows associated with forecasted transactions denominated in a foreign currency that will take place in the future.
310764_15_ITEM8_P38_S1	Changes in value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI on the consolidated balance sheets until earnings are affected by the variability of the underlying cash flows.
310764_15_ITEM8_P38_S2	At that time, the applicable amount of gain or loss from the derivative instrument that is deferred in shareholders equity is reclassified into earnings and is included in other income (expense) or cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of earnings, depending on the underlying transaction that is being hedged.
310764_15_ITEM8_P39_S0	We report our derivative instruments on a gross basis.
310764_15_ITEM8_P40_S0	Interest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges are being used to manage the exposure to interest rate movements and to reduce borrowing costs by converting fixed-rate debt into floating-rate debt.
310764_15_ITEM8_P40_S1	Under these agreements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.
310764_15_ITEM8_P41_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost.
310764_15_ITEM8_P41_S1	Depreciation is generally computed by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of three to 30 years for buildings and improvements and three to ten years for machinery and equipment.
310764_15_ITEM8_P42_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of tangible net assets of acquired businesses at the acquisition date, after amounts allocated to other identifiable intangible assets.
310764_15_ITEM8_P42_S1	Factors that contribute to the recognition of goodwill include securing synergies that are specific to our business and not available to other market participants and are expected to increase revenues and profits; acquisition of a talented workforce; cost savings opportunities; the strategic benefit of expanding our presence in core and adjacent markets; and diversifying our product portfolio.
310764_15_ITEM8_P43_S0	The fair values of other identifiable intangible assets are primarily determined using the income approach.
310764_15_ITEM8_P43_S1	Other intangible assets include, but are not limited to, developed technology, customer and distributor relationships (which reflect expected continued customer or distributor patronage) and trademarks and patents.
310764_15_ITEM8_P44_S0	Intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of four to 40 years.
310764_15_ITEM8_P45_S0	are not amortized, but are assessed annually for potential impairment as described below.
310764_15_ITEM8_P46_S0	In certain of our acquisitions, we acquire in-process research and development (IPRD) intangible assets.
310764_15_ITEM8_P46_S1	IPRD is considered to be an indefinite-lived intangible asset until such time as the research is completed (at which time it becomes a determinable-lived intangible asset) or determined to have no future use (at which time it is impaired).
310764_15_ITEM8_P47_S0	Goodwill, Intangibles and Long-Lived Asset Impairment Tests: We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year.
310764_15_ITEM8_P47_S1	We consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill.
310764_15_ITEM8_P47_S2	In certain circumstances, we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability.
310764_15_ITEM8_P47_S3	Indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested at least annually for impairment by comparing the individual carrying values to the fair value.
310764_15_ITEM8_P47_S4	We review long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
310764_15_ITEM8_P47_S5	The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows.
310764_15_ITEM8_P47_S6	Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the asset's useful life based on updated projections.
310764_15_ITEM8_P47_S7	If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique.
310764_15_ITEM8_P48_S0	Assets classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
310764_15_ITEM8_P49_S0	Share-Based Compensation: We utilize share based compensation in the form of stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance-based restricted stock units (PSUs).
310764_15_ITEM8_P50_S0	Compensation expense is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings based on the estimated fair value of the awards at grant date.
310764_15_ITEM8_P50_S1	Compensation expense recognized reflects an estimate of the number of awards expected to vest after taking into consideration an estimate of award forfeitures based on actual experience and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the period required to obtain full vesting.
310764_15_ITEM8_P50_S2	Management expectations related to the achievement of performance goals associated with PSU grants is assessed regularly and that assessment is used to determine whether PSU grants are expected to vest.
310764_15_ITEM8_P50_S3	If performance-based milestones related to PSU grants are not met or not expected to be met, any compensation expense recognized to date associated with grants that are not expected to vest will be reversed.
310764_15_ITEM8_P51_S0	Income Taxes: Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted income tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.
310764_15_ITEM8_P51_S1	Deferred income tax benefits generally represent the change in net deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year.
310764_15_ITEM8_P51_S2	Other amounts result from adjustments related to acquisitions as appropriate.
310764_15_ITEM8_P52_S0	We operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both within the United States and internationally.
310764_15_ITEM8_P52_S1	Accordingly, management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations.
310764_15_ITEM8_P52_S2	Income tax authorities in these jurisdictions regularly perform audits of our income tax filings.
310764_15_ITEM8_P53_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_15_ITEM8_P54_S0	royalty and foreign branch arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates.
310764_15_ITEM8_P54_S1	New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted:
310764_15_ITEM8_P55_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes and replaces nearly all currently-existing United States GAAP revenue recognition guidance including related disclosure requirements.
310764_15_ITEM8_P55_S1	This guidance will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2017.
310764_15_ITEM8_P55_S2	We have not yet completed our assessment of the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on our financial statements.
310764_15_ITEM8_P56_S0	Changes in and reclassifications out of AOCI, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were:
310764_15_ITEM8_P57_S0	NOTE 3 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1 Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
310764_15_ITEM8_P57_S1	Level 2 Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
310764_15_ITEM8_P57_S2	Level 3 Unobservable inputs reflecting our assumptions or external inputs from active markets.
310764_15_ITEM8_P58_S0	When applying fair value principles in the valuation of assets and liabilities, we are required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
310764_15_ITEM8_P59_S0	We calculate the fair value of our Level 1 and Level 2 instruments based on the exchange traded price of similar or identical instruments, where available, or based on other observable inputs.
310764_15_ITEM8_P59_S1	There were no significant transfers into or out of Level 1 or Level 2 that occurred between December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 .
310764_15_ITEM8_P60_S0	The fair value of our Level 3 assets and liabilities are calculated as the net present value of expected cash flows based on externally provided or obtained inputs.
310764_15_ITEM8_P60_S1	Certain Level 3 assets may also be based on sale prices of similar assets.
310764_15_ITEM8_P61_S0	Our fair value calculations take into consideration our credit risk and that of our counterparties.
310764_15_ITEM8_P61_S1	Should a counterparty default, our maximum exposure to loss is the asset balance of the instrument.
310764_15_ITEM8_P61_S2	We did not change our valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the year.
310764_15_ITEM8_P61_S3	Our valuation of our assets and liabilities measured at fair value at December 31, 2014 and 2013 is:
310764_15_ITEM8_P62_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_15_ITEM8_P63_S0	The cost and estimated fair value of available-for-sale marketable securities at December 31, 2014 by contractual maturity are:
310764_15_ITEM8_P64_S0	The estimated fair value of the liability for contingent consideration represents milestone payments for acquisitions.
310764_15_ITEM8_P64_S1	The fair value of the liability was estimated using a discounted cash flow technique.
310764_15_ITEM8_P64_S2	Significant unobservable inputs to this technique included our probability assessments of occurrence of triggering events, appropriately discounted considering the uncertainties associated with the obligation.
310764_15_ITEM8_P65_S0	occurrence) and other income (expense) (for changes in time value of money) in earnings.
310764_15_ITEM8_P65_S1	The fair value and probability assessments of occurrence of triggering events for contingent consideration fair value measurements classified in Level 3 at December 31, 2014 were:
310764_15_ITEM8_P66_S0	The unrealized losses on our available-for-sale marketable securities were primarily caused by increases in yields as a result of changing conditions in the global credit markets.
310764_15_ITEM8_P66_S1	While some of these investments have been downgraded by rating agencies since their initial purchase, less than 1% of our investments in available-for-sale marketable securities had a credit quality rating of less than single A (per Standard Poors and Fitch) and A2 (per Moody's).
310764_15_ITEM8_P66_S2	Because we do not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, we do not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2014 .
310764_15_ITEM8_P66_S3	The gross unrealized losses and fair value of our investments with unrealized losses that are not deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, aggregated by investment category and length of time that the individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at December 31, 2014 , are as follows:
310764_15_ITEM8_P67_S0	Interest and marketable securities income totaled $ 28 , $24 , and $47 in 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively, and is included in other income (expense).
310764_15_ITEM8_P68_S0	NOTE 4 - DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS We use operational and economic hedges as well as foreign currency exchange forward contracts and interest rate derivative instruments to manage the impact of currency exchange on earnings and cash flow.
310764_15_ITEM8_P69_S0	At the inception of the forward contract, the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge or is a free standing derivative.
310764_15_ITEM8_P70_S0	We do not enter into currency exchange derivative instruments for speculative purposes.
310764_15_ITEM8_P70_S1	Derivative Instruments Not Designated as Hedges Derivative forward contracts are used to offset our exposure to the change in value of specific foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
310764_15_ITEM8_P70_S2	These derivatives are not designated as hedges and, therefore, changes in the value of these forward contracts are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related changes in value of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
310764_15_ITEM8_P71_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_15_ITEM8_P72_S0	of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points.
310764_15_ITEM8_P73_S0	Cash Flow Hedges We use a layered hedging program to hedge select anticipated foreign currency cash flows to reduce volatility in both cash flows and reported earnings.
310764_15_ITEM8_P73_S1	These foreign exchange contracts generally have maturities up to eighteen months.
310764_15_ITEM8_P74_S0	For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of AOCI and reclassified into other income (expense) or cost of sales within earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
310764_15_ITEM8_P74_S1	In 2013 a gain of $9 was reclassified from AOCI to earnings relating to the discontinuance of certain cash flow hedges, as we considered it probable that the original forecasted transactions would not occur.
310764_15_ITEM8_P74_S2	Cash flows associated with these hedges are included in cash from operations in the same category as the cash flows from the items being hedged.
310764_15_ITEM8_P75_S0	The gross notional, maximum term and gross fair value amounts of foreign exchange forward contract derivatives designated and non-designated as hedging instruments are:
310764_15_ITEM8_P76_S0	We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on our outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our counterparties.
310764_15_ITEM8_P76_S1	Should a counterparty default, our maximum exposure to loss is the asset balance of the instrument.
310764_15_ITEM8_P76_S2	Recognized foreign currency transaction gains (losses) included in earnings were:
310764_15_ITEM8_P77_S0	At December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, pretax gains on derivatives designated as hedges of $15 and $ 12 , which are recorded in AOCI, are expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next 12 months.
310764_15_ITEM8_P77_S1	This reclassification is primarily due to the sale of inventory that includes previously hedged purchases.
310764_15_ITEM8_P78_S0	Fair Value Hedges Interest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges are being used to manage the exposure to interest rate movements and to reduce borrowing costs by converting fixed-rate debt into floating-rate debt.
310764_15_ITEM8_P79_S0	Under these agreements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.
310764_15_ITEM8_P79_S1	At December 31, 2014, we had interest rate swaps in gross notional amounts of $ 500 designated as fair value hedges of underlying fixed rate obligations representing a portion of our $ 600 senior unsecured notes due in 2024.
310764_15_ITEM8_P79_S2	The market value of outstanding interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2014 was a recognized gain of $ 10 which is recorded in other long-term assets with an offsetting recognized loss of $ 10 on the fair value of the underlying fixed rate obligation recorded in long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheet.
310764_15_ITEM8_P79_S3	No hedge ineffectiveness was recorded as a result of these fair value hedges in 2014.
310764_15_ITEM8_P80_S0	During September 2014 we acquired the assets of Small Bone Innovations, Inc. (SBi) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $358 .
310764_15_ITEM8_P80_S1	SBi products are designed and promoted for upper and lower extremity small bone indications, with a focus on small joint replacement.
310764_15_ITEM8_P80_S2	The acquisition of the assets of SBi enhances our product offerings within our Orthopaedics segment.
310764_15_ITEM8_P80_S3	Intangible assets acquired with SBi will be amortized over a weighted-average life of 12 years .
310764_15_ITEM8_P81_S0	In April 2014 we acquired Berchtold Holding, AG (Berchtold), a privately-held business with operations in Germany and the United States, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $184 .
310764_15_ITEM8_P81_S1	Berchtold sells surgical tables, equipment booms and surgical lighting systems.
310764_15_ITEM8_P81_S2	In March 2014 we acquired Patient Safety Technologies, Inc. (PST), for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $120 .
310764_15_ITEM8_P81_S3	PST conducts its business through its wholly owned subsidiary, SurgiCount Medical, Inc. PST s proprietary Safety-Sponge System and SurgiCount 360 compliance software help prevent Retained Foreign Objects in the operating room.
310764_15_ITEM8_P82_S0	In addition to the acquisition of Pivot Medical Inc., which develops and sells innovative products for hip arthroscopy, our other acquisitions are included in Other.
310764_15_ITEM8_P82_S1	These acquisitions enhance our product offerings within our MedSurg segment.
310764_15_ITEM8_P82_S2	The purchase price allocations for the 2014 acquisitions were based upon preliminary valuations, and our estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period.
310764_15_ITEM8_P82_S3	Management is currently in the process of verifying data and finalizing information related to the 2014 acquisitions and the valuation and recording of identifiable intangible assets, deferred income taxes and the corresponding effect on the value of goodwill.
310764_15_ITEM8_P83_S0	2013 Acquisitions In December 2013 we acquired MAKO Surgical Corp. (MAKO) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1,677 .
310764_15_ITEM8_P83_S1	The acquisition of MAKO, combined with our strong history in joint reconstruction, capital equipment (operating room integration and surgical navigation) and surgical instruments, will help further advance the growth of robotic assisted surgery.
310764_15_ITEM8_P83_S2	Our combined expertise offers the potential to simplify joint reconstruction procedures, reduce variability and enhance the surgeon and patient experience.
310764_15_ITEM8_P83_S3	The acquisition of MAKO enhances our product offerings within our Orthopaedics segment.
310764_15_ITEM8_P83_S4	Intangible assets acquired with MAKO will be amortized over a weighted-average life of 9 years .

310764_15_ITEM8_P85_S0	In March 2013 we acquired Trauson Holdings Company Limited (Trauson) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $751 .
310764_15_ITEM8_P85_S1	The acquisition of Trauson enhances our product offerings, primarily within our Orthopaedics segment, broadens our presence in China and enables us to expand into the fast growing value segment of the emerging markets.
310764_15_ITEM8_P86_S0	Intangible assets acquired with Trauson will be amortized over a weighted-average life of 15 years , except for the trade name that is deemed to have an indefinite life.
310764_15_ITEM8_P86_S1	For the MAKO and Trauson acquisitions, the measurement periods have been completed and revisions to our original estimates are included in the table below.
310764_15_ITEM8_P86_S2	The effects of all the acquisitions described above are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements prospectively from the date of acquisition.
310764_15_ITEM8_P86_S3	Pro forma consolidated results of operations for 2014 and 2013 would not differ significantly as a result of these acquisitions.
310764_15_ITEM8_P86_S4	The allocation of the purchase price to the acquired net assets of the acquisitions described above are as follows:
310764_15_ITEM8_P87_S0	Goodwill acquired associated with the SBi acquisition in 2014 is deductible for tax purposes.
310764_15_ITEM8_P88_S0	NOTE 6 - GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS We completed our annual impairment tests of goodwill in 2014 and 2013 and concluded in each year that no impairments exist.
310764_15_ITEM8_P88_S1	The changes in the net carrying value of goodwill by segment are as follows:
310764_15_ITEM8_P89_S0	The following is a summary of our other intangible assets:
310764_15_ITEM8_P90_S0	Amortization expense related to intangible assets was $ 188 , $ 138 and $ 123 for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
310764_15_ITEM8_P90_S1	The estimated amortization expense for each of the next five years is:
310764_15_ITEM8_P91_S0	NOTE 7 - CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS We are involved in various ongoing proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property, and other matters that are more fully described below.
310764_15_ITEM8_P91_S1	The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time.
310764_15_ITEM8_P92_S0	In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory and equitable relief, that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief.
310764_15_ITEM8_P93_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_15_ITEM8_P94_S0	reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management's best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known.
310764_15_ITEM8_P94_S1	The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies.
310764_15_ITEM8_P94_S2	If actual outcomes are less favorable than those estimated by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.
310764_15_ITEM8_P95_S0	We are currently self-insured for product liability-related claims and expenses.
310764_15_ITEM8_P95_S1	The ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_15_ITEM8_P95_S2	In June 2012 we voluntarily recalled our Rejuvenate and ABG II Modular-Neck hip stems and terminated global distribution of these hip products.
310764_15_ITEM8_P95_S3	Product liability lawsuits relating to this voluntary recall have been filed against us.
310764_15_ITEM8_P96_S0	On November 3, 2014 we announced that we had entered into a settlement agreement to compensate eligible United States patients who had revision surgery to replace their Rejuvenate and/or ABG II Modular-Neck hip stem prior to that date.
310764_15_ITEM8_P96_S1	We continue to offer support for recall-related care and reimburse patients who are not eligible to enroll in the settlement program for testing and treatment services, including any necessary revision surgeries.
310764_15_ITEM8_P96_S2	In addition, some lawsuits will remain and we will continue to defend against them.
310764_15_ITEM8_P97_S0	Based on the information that has been received, the actuarially determined range of probable loss to resolve this entire matter on a global basis is estimated to be approximately $ 1,534 ($ 1,713 before $ 179 of third-party insurance recoveries) to $ 2,453 .
310764_15_ITEM8_P97_S1	In 2014, we recorded charges to earnings, net of insurance recoveries, of $ 748 representing the excess of the minimum of the range over the previously recorded reserves.
310764_15_ITEM8_P97_S2	The final outcome of this matter is dependent on many factors that are difficult to predict including the number of enrollees in the settlement program and total awards to them, the number and costs of patients not eligible for the settlement program who seek testing and treatment services and require revision surgery and the number and actual costs to resolve the remaining lawsuits.
310764_15_ITEM8_P97_S3	Accordingly, the ultimate cost to resolve this entire matter globally may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_15_ITEM8_P98_S0	In 2010 we filed a lawsuit in federal court against Zimmer Holdings, Inc. (Zimmer), alleging that a Zimmer product infringed three of our patents.
310764_15_ITEM8_P98_S1	In 2013, following a jury trial favorable to us, the trial judge entered a final judgment that among other things, awarded us damages of $ 76 and ordered Zimmer to pay us enhanced damages.
310764_15_ITEM8_P98_S2	In December 2014 the Federal Circuit affirmed the damages awarded to us, reversed the order for enhanced damages and remanded the issue of attorney fees to the trial court.
310764_15_ITEM8_P98_S3	We have filed for a petition for rehearing en banc on the issue of enhanced damages.
310764_15_ITEM8_P99_S0	Following the conclusion of the proceedings at the Federal Circuit, each party may seek Supreme Court review.
310764_15_ITEM8_P99_S1	We have not recorded a contingent gain related to this matter.
310764_15_ITEM8_P100_S0	In April 2011 Hill-Rom Company, Inc. and affiliated entities (Hill-Rom) brought a lawsuit against us alleging infringement under United States patent laws with respect to nine patents related to electrical network communications for hospital beds.
310764_15_ITEM8_P100_S1	The case has been stayed with respect to six of the patents, which are currently under reexamination by the United States Patent Office.
310764_15_ITEM8_P100_S2	With respect to the three remaining patents, Hill-Rom appealed the trial court's grant of summary judgment in our favor and the Federal Circuit reversed the trial court's decision and remanded the matter for additional proceedings.
310764_15_ITEM8_P101_S0	cannot be predicted and it is not possible at this time for us to estimate any probable loss or range of probable losses.
310764_15_ITEM8_P101_S1	However, the ultimate result could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_15_ITEM8_P102_S0	We have purchase commitments for materials, supplies, services and property, plant and equipment as part of the normal course of business.
310764_15_ITEM8_P102_S1	In addition, we lease various manufacturing, warehousing and distribution facilities, administrative and sales offices as well as equipment under operating leases.
310764_15_ITEM8_P102_S2	Future commitments under these obligations and minimum lease commitments under these leases are:
310764_15_ITEM8_P103_S0	Rent expense totaled $ 103 , $ 100 , and $ 98 in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
310764_15_ITEM8_P103_S1	In August 2014 we amended and restated our Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility.
310764_15_ITEM8_P103_S2	The principal changes were to increase the aggregate principal amount of the commitments to $ 1,250 , to extend the maturity date to August 22, 2019 and to revise the definition of the consolidated Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA).
310764_15_ITEM8_P104_S0	During 2014 we issued commercial paper under the commercial paper program.
310764_15_ITEM8_P104_S1	The program allows us to have a maximum of $ 1,250 in commercial paper outstanding, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance.
310764_15_ITEM8_P104_S2	At December 31, 2014 , outstanding commercial paper totaled $ 200 , the weighted average original maturity of the commercial paper outstanding was approximately 62 days and the weighted average interest rate was 0.2% .
310764_15_ITEM8_P104_S3	In May 2014 we sold $600 in senior unsecured notes due 2024 (2024 Notes) and $400 of senior unsecured notes due 2044 (2044 Notes).
310764_15_ITEM8_P104_S4	The 2024 Notes will bear interest at 3.375% per year and, unless previously redeemed, will mature on May 15, 2024.
310764_15_ITEM8_P104_S5	The 2044 Notes will bear interest at 4.375% per year and, unless previously redeemed, will mature on May 15, 2044.
310764_15_ITEM8_P105_S0	Certain of our credit facilities require us to comply with financial and other covenants.
310764_15_ITEM8_P105_S1	We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2014 .
310764_15_ITEM8_P105_S2	We have lines of credit, issued by various financial institutions, available to fund our day-to-day operating needs.
310764_15_ITEM8_P105_S3	At December 31, 2014 , we had $1,289 of borrowing capacity available under all of our existing credit facilities.
310764_15_ITEM8_P106_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_15_ITEM8_P107_S0	average interest rate, excluding required fees, for all borrowings was 2.9% at December 31, 2014 .
310764_15_ITEM8_P107_S1	At December 31, 2014 , the total unamortized debt issuance costs incurred in connection with our outstanding notes were $ 21 .
310764_15_ITEM8_P107_S2	The fair value of long-term debt (including current maturities and excluding the interest rate hedge) at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was $ 3,811 and $2,790 , respectively.
310764_15_ITEM8_P107_S3	Substantially all of our long-term debt is classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because the fair value of the debt is estimated based on rates currently offered to us with identical terms and maturities, using quoted active market prices and yields, taking into account the underlying terms of the debt instruments.
310764_15_ITEM8_P107_S4	Interest expense, including required fees incurred on outstanding debt and credit facilities, which is included in other income (expense), totaled $113 , $83 , and $63 in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
310764_15_ITEM8_P107_S5	Cash interest paid on debt, including required fees, was $ 102 , $88 , and $55 in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
310764_15_ITEM8_P107_S6	In December 2013 we declared a quarterly dividend of $ 0.305 per share, payable January 31, 2014 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 31, 2013.
310764_15_ITEM8_P107_S7	In February 2014 we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.305 per share, payable April 30, 2014 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 28, 2014.
310764_15_ITEM8_P107_S8	In April 2014 we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.305 per share, payable July 31, 2014 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 28, 2014.
310764_15_ITEM8_P107_S9	In July 2014 we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.305 per share, payable October 31, 2014 to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 30, 2013.
310764_15_ITEM8_P107_S10	In December 2014 we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.345 per share, payable January 31, 2015 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 31, 2014.
310764_15_ITEM8_P108_S0	In December of 2012 and 2011, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized us to purchase up to $405 and $500 , respectively, of our common stock (the 2012 and 2011 Repurchase Programs, respectively).
310764_15_ITEM8_P108_S1	The manner, timing and amount of purchases is determined by management based on an evaluation of market conditions, stock price and other factors and is subject to regulatory considerations.
310764_15_ITEM8_P108_S2	Purchases are to be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.
310764_15_ITEM8_P108_S3	During 2014 we repurchased 1.3 million shares at a cost of $100 under the 2011 Repurchase Program.
310764_15_ITEM8_P108_S4	We had made no repurchases pursuant to the 2012 Repurchase Program at December 31, 2014 .
310764_15_ITEM8_P109_S0	Shares repurchased under the share repurchase programs are available for general corporate purposes, including offsetting dilution associated with stock option and other equity-based employee benefit plans.
310764_15_ITEM8_P109_S1	At December 31, 2014 , the maximum dollar value of shares that may be purchased under the authorized Repurchase Programs was $583 .
310764_15_ITEM8_P109_S2	Shares reserved for future compensation grants of Stryker common stock were 19 million and 23 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
310764_15_ITEM8_P109_S3	We have 0.5 million authorized shares of $1 par value preferred stock, none of which is outstanding.
310764_15_ITEM8_P110_S0	Stock Options We have long-term incentive plans from which we grant stock options to certain key employees and non-employee directors at an exercise price not less than the fair market value of the underlying common stock, which is the closing quoted price of our common stock on the day prior to the date of grant.
310764_15_ITEM8_P110_S1	The options are granted for periods of up to 10 years and become exercisable in varying installments.
310764_15_ITEM8_P111_S0	We measure the cost of employee stock options based on the grant-date fair value and recognize that cost using the straight-line method over the period during which a recipient is required to provide services in exchange for the options, typically the vesting period.
310764_15_ITEM8_P111_S1	The weighted-average fair value per share of options granted during 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, was $15.80 , $15.24 , and $13.36 , respectively.
310764_15_ITEM8_P111_S2	The fair value of options granted was estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:
310764_15_ITEM8_P112_S0	The risk-free interest rate for periods within the expected life of options granted is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
310764_15_ITEM8_P113_S0	Expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock.
310764_15_ITEM8_P113_S1	The expected option life, representing the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, is based on historical option exercise and employee termination data.
310764_15_ITEM8_P113_S2	A summary of 2014 stock option activity is as follows:
310764_15_ITEM8_P114_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value, which represents the cumulative difference between the fair market value of the underlying common stock and the option exercise prices, of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 was $ 113 , $97 , and $52 , respectively.
310764_15_ITEM8_P114_S1	Exercise prices for options outstanding at December 31, 2014 ranged from $38.71 to $81.14 .
310764_15_ITEM8_P114_S2	At December 31, 2014 , there was $64 of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options granted under the long-term incentive plans; that cost is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average period of 1.5 years .
310764_15_ITEM8_P115_S0	We grant RSUs to key employees and non-employee directors and PSUs to certain key employees under our long-term incentive plans.
310764_15_ITEM8_P115_S1	The fair value of RSUs is determined based on the number of shares granted and the closing quoted price of our common stock on the day prior to the date of grant, adjusted for the fact that RSUs do not include anticipated dividends.
310764_15_ITEM8_P115_S2	RSUs generally vest in one-third increments over a three-year period and are settled in stock.
310764_15_ITEM8_P115_S3	PSUs are earned over a three-year performance cycle and vest in March of the year following the end of that performance cycle.
310764_15_ITEM8_P115_S4	The number of PSUs that will ultimately be earned is based on our performance relative to pre-established goals during that three-year performance cycle.
310764_15_ITEM8_P115_S5	The fair value of PSUs is determined based on the closing quoted price of our common stock on the day prior to the date of grant.
310764_15_ITEM8_P115_S6	A summary of 2014 RSU and PSU activity is as follows:
310764_15_ITEM8_P116_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_15_ITEM8_P117_S0	At December 31, 2014 there was $45 of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested RSUs.
310764_15_ITEM8_P117_S1	That cost is expected to be recognized as expense over the weighted-average period of 0.9 years .
310764_15_ITEM8_P117_S2	The weighted-average grant date fair value per share of RSUs granted in 2014 and 2013 was $76.61 and $60.81 , respectively.
310764_15_ITEM8_P117_S3	The fair value of RSUs vested in 2014 was $39 .
310764_15_ITEM8_P117_S4	At December 31, 2014 , there was $9 of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested PSUs; that cost is expected to be recognized as expense over the weighted-average period of one year.
310764_15_ITEM8_P118_S0	Employee Stock Purchase Plans (ESPP) Full- time and part-time employees may participate in our ESPP provided they meet certain eligibility requirements.
310764_15_ITEM8_P118_S1	The purchase price for our common stock under the terms of the ESPP is defined as 95% of the closing stock price on the last trading day of a purchase period.
310764_15_ITEM8_P118_S2	During 2014 and 2013 , we issued 150,167 and 163,533 shares, respectively, under the ESPP.
310764_15_ITEM8_P119_S0	NOTE 10 - INCOME TAXES Earnings before income taxes consisted of:
310764_15_ITEM8_P120_S0	In 2014 we recorded the income tax impacts of the establishment of a European regional headquarters and a cash repatriation to the United States planned for 2015.
310764_15_ITEM8_P120_S1	In 2013 we recorded income tax benefits related to favorable audit resolutions in multiple jurisdictions.
310764_15_ITEM8_P121_S0	In 2014, 2013 and 2012, the United States federal deferred income tax expense (benefit) includes the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards of $ 78 , $ 16 and $ 16 , respectively.
310764_15_ITEM8_P122_S0	Reconciliation of the United States federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate:
310764_15_ITEM8_P123_S0	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities:
310764_15_ITEM8_P124_S0	Net operating loss carryforwards totaling $376 at December 31, 2014 are available to reduce future taxable earnings of certain domestic and foreign subsidiaries.
310764_15_ITEM8_P124_S1	United States loss carryforwards of $288 expire between 2014 and 2033 .
310764_15_ITEM8_P124_S2	International loss carryforwards of $88 expire beginning in 2014 ; however, some have no expiration.
310764_15_ITEM8_P124_S3	Of these carryforwards, $43 are subject to a full valuation allowance.
310764_15_ITEM8_P124_S4	We also have a tax credit carryforward of $31 with a full valuation allowance.
310764_15_ITEM8_P124_S5	These credits have no expiration; however, we do not anticipate generating income tax in excess of the credits in the foreseeable future.
310764_15_ITEM8_P124_S6	No provision has been made for United States federal and state income taxes or international income taxes that may result from future remittances of the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are determined to be indefinitely reinvested ( $5,878 at December 31, 2014 ).
310764_15_ITEM8_P124_S7	Determination of the amount of any unrecognized deferred income tax liability on these is not practicable.
310764_15_ITEM8_P125_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_15_ITEM8_P126_S0	The changes in the amounts recorded for uncertain income tax positions are:
310764_15_ITEM8_P127_S0	Our income tax expense could have been reduced by $307 and $194 at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, had these uncertain income tax positions been favorably resolved.
310764_15_ITEM8_P128_S0	It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change due to one or more of the following events in the next twelve months: expiring statutes, audit activity, tax payments, competent authority proceedings related to transfer pricing or final decisions in matters that are the subject of controversy in various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing, product royalty and foreign branch arrangements.
310764_15_ITEM8_P128_S1	We are not able to reasonably estimate the amount or the future periods in which changes in unrecognized tax benefits may be resolved; however, we do not anticipate any significant changes within the next twelve months.
310764_15_ITEM8_P129_S0	Interest and penalties incurred associated with uncertain tax positions are included in other income (expense).
310764_15_ITEM8_P130_S0	In the normal course of business, income tax authorities in various income tax jurisdictions both within the United States and internationally conduct routine audits of our income tax returns filed in prior years.
310764_15_ITEM8_P130_S1	These audits are generally designed to determine if individual income tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretations of complex income tax regulations regarding the allocation of income to the various income tax jurisdictions.
310764_15_ITEM8_P130_S2	Income tax years are open from 2010 through the current year for the United States federal jurisdiction; income tax years open for our other major jurisdictions range from 2005 through the current year.
310764_15_ITEM8_P131_S0	NOTE 11 - RETIREMENT PLANS Defined Contribution Plans We provide certain employees with defined contribution plans.
310764_15_ITEM8_P131_S1	A portion of our retirement plan expense under the defined contribution plans is funded with Stryker common stock.
310764_15_ITEM8_P132_S0	The use of Stryker common stock represents a non-cash operating activity that is not reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
310764_15_ITEM8_P133_S0	Defined Benefit Plans Certain of our subsidiaries have both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans covering some or all of their employees.
310764_15_ITEM8_P133_S1	Substantially all of the defined benefit pension plans have projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets.
310764_15_ITEM8_P134_S0	The estimated net actuarial loss for the defined benefit pension plans to be reclassified from AOCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2015 is $9 .
310764_15_ITEM8_P134_S1	We estimate that an immaterial amount of amortization of prior service cost and transition amount for the defined benefit pension plans will be reclassified from AOCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2014.
310764_15_ITEM8_P135_S0	Pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets had projected benefit obligations, accumulated benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets of $570 , $533 , and $310 , respectively, at December 31, 2014 and $456 , $427 , and $281 , respectively, at December 31, 2013 .
310764_15_ITEM8_P136_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_15_ITEM8_P137_S0	Discount rate The discount rates were selected using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds at December 31 that would provide the necessary cash flows to match our projected benefit payments.
310764_15_ITEM8_P138_S0	Expected return on plan assets The expected return on plan assets is determined by applying the target allocation in each asset category of plan investments to the anticipated return for each asset category based on historical and projected returns.
310764_15_ITEM8_P139_S0	The investment strategy for our defined benefit pension plans is to meet the liabilities of the plans as they fall due and to maximize the return on invested assets within appropriate risk tolerances.
310764_15_ITEM8_P140_S0	The weighted-average target and actual allocation of plan assets by asset category is as follows:
310764_15_ITEM8_P141_S0	Valuation of Our Pension Plan Assets by Pricing Categories:
310764_15_ITEM8_P142_S0	Our Level 3 pension plan assets (See Note 3 for an explanation of our fair value hierarchy) consist primarily of guaranteed investment contracts with insurance companies.
310764_15_ITEM8_P142_S1	The insurance contracts guarantee us principal repayment and a fixed rate of return.
310764_15_ITEM8_P143_S0	Our valuation of Level 3 assets is based on third-party actuarial valuations that are an estimation of the surrender value of the guaranteed investment contract between us and the insurance company.
310764_15_ITEM8_P143_S1	The surrender value equals the actuarial value of the notional investments underlying the guaranteed investment contract, using the actuarial assumptions as stated in the guaranteed investment contract.
310764_15_ITEM8_P144_S0	We expect to contribute $19 to our defined benefit pension plans in 2015 .
310764_15_ITEM8_P144_S1	The estimated future benefit payments by year based on expected future service as appropriate are:
310764_15_ITEM8_P145_S0	In 2014 we changed the name of our Reconstructive business segment to Orthopaedics.
310764_15_ITEM8_P145_S1	The name change did not change the composition of any of our business segments and had no financial impact.
310764_15_ITEM8_P145_S2	We segregate our operations into three reportable business segments: Orthopaedics, MedSurg, and Neurotechnology and Spine.
310764_15_ITEM8_P146_S0	The Orthopaedics segment includes reconstructive (hip and knee) and trauma implant systems as well as other related products.
310764_15_ITEM8_P146_S1	The MedSurg segment includes surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems (Instruments); endoscopic and communications systems (Endoscopy); patient handling and emergency medical equipment (Medical); and reprocessed and remanufactured medical devices (Sustainability) as well as other products.
310764_15_ITEM8_P146_S2	The Neurotechnology and Spine segment includes neurovascular products, spinal implant systems and other related products.
310764_15_ITEM8_P147_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.

310764_15_ITEM8_P148_S1	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation of our segments.
310764_15_ITEM8_P148_S2	Results for our reportable segments were:
310764_15_ITEM8_P149_S0	Total assets and capital spending by reportable segments were:
310764_15_ITEM8_P150_S0	Our reportable segments are business units that offer different products and services and are managed separately because each business requires different manufacturing, technology and marketing strategies.
310764_15_ITEM8_P150_S1	The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_15_ITEM8_P150_S2	We measure the financial results of our reportable segments using an internal performance measure that excludes acquisition and integration-related charges, restructuring related charges, reserves for certain product recall matters, reserves for certain legal and regulatory matters, a donation to an educational institution, and certain income tax adjustments.
310764_15_ITEM8_P151_S0	Identifiable assets are those assets used exclusively in the operations of each business segment or allocated when used jointly.
310764_15_ITEM8_P151_S1	Corporate assets are principally cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and property, plant and equipment.
310764_15_ITEM8_P152_S0	States (including Puerto Rico); Europe, Middle East, Africa (EMEA); Asia Pacific; and other foreign countries, which include Canada and countries in the Latin American region.

310764_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures An evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2014 was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (the Certifying Officers).
310764_15_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on that evaluation, the Certifying Officers concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
310764_15_ITEM9A_P0_S2	There was no change to our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2014 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
310764_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The management of Stryker Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
310764_15_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Stryker Corporation s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company's management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
310764_15_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Stryker Corporation s management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 .
310764_15_ITEM9A_P1_S3	In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework .
310764_15_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Based on that assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.
310764_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The internal controls over financial reporting of an acquired business are eligible for a one year exclusion as permitted by Securities and Exchange Commission Staff interpretive guidance.
310764_15_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Accordingly, management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Small Bone Innovations, Inc., Berchtold Holding, AG, Patient Safety Technology, Inc., and other 2014 acquisitions which are included in the December 31, 2014 consolidated financial statements of Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries.
310764_15_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Assets and shareholders' equity excluded from management's assessment constitute 1.1% and 1.0% of total assets and shareholders' equity, respectively, as of December 31, 2014 and 1.2% and (2.2%) of revenues and net earnings, respectively, for the year then ended.
310764_15_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Stryker Corporation s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
310764_15_ITEM9A_P4_S1	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF STRYKER CORPORATION:
310764_15_ITEM9A_P5_S0	We have audited Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
310764_15_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries' management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
310764_15_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
310764_15_ITEM9A_P5_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
310764_15_ITEM9A_P5_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
310764_15_ITEM9A_P5_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
310764_15_ITEM9A_P5_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
310764_15_ITEM9A_P6_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
310764_15_ITEM9A_P6_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
310764_15_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
310764_15_ITEM9A_P6_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
310764_15_ITEM9A_P7_S0	As indicated in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Small Bone Innovations, Inc., Berchtold Holding, AG, Patient Safety Technology, Inc., and other acquisitions which are included in the December 31, 2014 consolidated financial statements of Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries and constituted 1.1% and 1.0% of total assets and shareholders' equity, respectively, as of December 31, 2014 and 1.2% and (2.2%) of revenues and net earnings, respectively, for the year then ended.
310764_15_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Small Bone Innovations, Inc., Berchtold Holding, AG, Patient Safety Technology, Inc., and other acquisitions.
310764_15_ITEM9A_P8_S0	In our opinion, Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 , based on the COSO criteria.
310764_15_ITEM9A_P8_S1	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 and the related consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 of Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries, and our report dated February 12, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

310764_15_ITEM15_P655_S1	Further, the Parties recognize that HOC s key objective in entering into this Agreement and agreeing to establish the Settlement Program is that all Claimants who are eligible for the Settlement Program accept this Agreement and enroll in the Settlement Program in full and final resolution of their Settlement Program Claims.
310764_15_ITEM15_P655_S2	The Parties also recognize that the SOC s key objective in entering into this Agreement is to fairly compensate any Settlement Program Claim which qualifies under this Agreement and to work with the Claims Processor, Special Masters and the Claims Administrator on an allocation and informed consent process that accomplishes these goals.
310764_15_ITEM15_P655_S3	The SOC believes that this Agreement accomplishes these objectives and upon the execution and the Parties endorsement of the Agreement, the SOC will present the Agreement to any counsel who has Affected Product cases in either state or federal court.

310764_15_ITEM15_P659_S0	However, any Counsel of a client is to ensure that the Primary Law Firm, including Principal Responsible Attorney, in good faith fulfills this informed consent responsibility and with respect to participation in the Settlement Program.
310764_15_ITEM15_P659_S1	The Parties recognize, however, that the decision whether to enroll in the Settlement Program rests with each individual Claimant.
310764_15_ITEM15_P660_S0	16.2.6 At the SOC s expense and on notice to HOC, the Special Masters will be available to assist the Primary Law Firms, Principal Responsible Attorneys and all other Counsel with the informed consent process, including answering both general and specific questions with respect to the Settlement Program.

310764_15_ITEM15_P661_S0	The purpose of this provision is to ensure that each Claimant who is eligible for the Settlement Program has the opportunity to make an informed decision regarding participation in the Settlement Program.
310764_15_ITEM15_P662_S0	At the time of enrollment, each Primary Law Firm will serve on the Claims Processor and HOC a document which (a) identifies each Claimant who is eligible for the Settlement Program from which the Primary Law Firm has obtained informed consent, (b) represents that they have presented the terms of the Settlement Program to each of their respective clients for whom they are the Primary Law Firm who would be eligible to enroll in the Settlement Program, and (c) identifies each of their respective clients who has consented to be enrolled in the Settlement Program, without waiving any attorney client privileged communications.
310764_15_ITEM15_P663_S0	16.2.8 With the objectives of the Agreement in mind, each Primary Law Firm, Principal Responsible Attorney and all other Counsel must act in good faith with respect to the informed consent process and with respect to participation in the Settlement Program by their clients with whom they have an interest.
310764_15_ITEM15_P663_S1	At the time of enrollment, each Primary Law Firm and Principal Responsible Attorney shall represent and warrant that they each will use their best efforts to secure all documentation required for timely enrollment and compliance with this Agreement, including Releases and, where applicable, Stipulations of Dismissal with Prejudice, from all of their clients who elect to enroll in the Settlement Program and to otherwise effectuate the terms of this Agreement and, subject to the exercise of their independent professional judgment as to the circumstances of individual clients, they will endorse enrollment in the Settlement Program to clients covered by this Agreement.
310764_15_ITEM15_P664_S0	1 The Team and SOC, and their designees, are entirely responsible for the creation of the informed consent documentation about the Settlement Program to be used to assist the Primary Law Firm and Counsel with their clients.
310764_15_ITEM15_P664_S1	Neither HOC nor any Released Parties have any responsibility or involvement in connection with informing potentially eligible Claimants about the terms of the Settlement Program or in obtaining informed consent from potentially eligible Claimants to be enrolled in the Settlement Program.
310764_15_ITEM15_P665_S0	16.2.9 HOC may also seek from the Special Masters a report with respect to any Primary Law Firm, Principal Responsible Attorney or all other Counsel s good faith participation in the Agreement and Settlement Program.

310764_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	Raw Materials and Inventory Raw materials essential to our business are generally readily available from multiple sources.
310764_16_ITEM1_P17_S1	Substantially all products we manufacture are stocked in inventory, while certain MedSurg products are assembled to order.
310764_16_ITEM1_P17_S2	The dollar amount of backlog orders at any given time is not considered material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole.
310764_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	Patents and Trademarks Patents and trademarks are significant to our business to the extent that a product or an attribute of a product represents a unique design or process.
310764_16_ITEM1_P18_S1	Patent protection of such products restricts competitors from duplicating these unique designs and features.
310764_16_ITEM1_P18_S2	We seek to obtain patent protection on our products whenever appropriate for protecting our competitive advantage.
310764_16_ITEM1_P18_S3	On December 31, 2015 we owned approximately 1,884 United States patents and approximately 3,014 international patents.
310764_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	Seasonality Our business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is typically lower during the summer months, and sales of capital equipment are generally higher in the fourth quarter.
310764_16_ITEM1_P19_S1	In all of our product lines we compete with local and global companies.
310764_16_ITEM1_P19_S2	Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved.
310764_16_ITEM1_P19_S3	The development of new and innovative products is important to our success in all areas of our business and competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant.
310764_16_ITEM1_P19_S4	The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and in maintaining sales forces.
310764_16_ITEM1_P19_S5	The principal factors that we believe differentiate us in the highly competitive product categories in which we operate and enable us to compete effectively include our commitment to innovation and quality, service and reputation.
310764_16_ITEM1_P19_S6	We believe that our competitive position in the future will depend to a large degree on our ability to develop new products and make improvements to existing products.
310764_16_ITEM1_P19_S7	Product Development Most of our products and product improvements have been developed internally at research facilities in the United States, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Puerto Rico and Switzerland.
310764_16_ITEM1_P19_S8	We also invest through acquisitions in technologies developed by third parties that have the potential to expand the markets in which we operate.

310764_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	Our businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation.
310764_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	In the United States the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its subsequent amendments, and the regulations issued and proposed thereunder, provide for regulation by the FDA of the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices, including most of our products.
310764_16_ITEM1_P21_S1	Many of our new products fall into FDA classifications that require notification submitted as a 510(k) and review by the FDA before we begin marketing them.
310764_16_ITEM1_P21_S2	Certain of our products require extensive clinical testing, consisting of safety and efficacy studies, followed by pre-market approval (PMA) applications for specific surgical indications.
310764_16_ITEM1_P21_S3	The FDA's Quality System regulations set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the FDA.
310764_16_ITEM1_P21_S4	There are also certain requirements of state, local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the manufacture and marketing of our products.
310764_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	The member states of the European Union (EU) have adopted the European Medical Device Directives that form a single set of medical device regulations for all EU member countries.
310764_16_ITEM1_P22_S1	These regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member countries to meet certain quality system requirements and obtain CE marking for their products.
310764_16_ITEM1_P22_S2	We have authorization to apply the CE marking to substantially all of our products.
310764_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	unique regulatory requirements of each of the countries in Europe and other countries in which we market our products.
310764_16_ITEM1_P24_S1	Initiatives sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare expenses generally and hospital costs in particular, including price regulation and competitive pricing, are ongoing in markets where we do business.
310764_16_ITEM1_P24_S2	It is not possible to predict at this time the long-term impact of such cost containment measures on our future business.
310764_16_ITEM1_P24_S3	In addition, business practices in the healthcare industry are scrutinized, particularly in the United States, by federal and state government agencies, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.
310764_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	Employees On December 31, 2015 we had approximately 27,000 employees globally.
310764_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	Certain international employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
310764_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	We believe that we maintain positive relationships with our employees globally.

310764_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	This report contains statements referring to us that are not historical facts and are considered "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These statements, which are intended to take advantage of the "safe harbor" provisions of the Reform Act, are based on current projections about operations, industry conditions, financial condition and liquidity.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Words that identify forward-looking statements include words such as "may," "could," "will," "should," "possible," "plan," "predict," "forecast," "potential," "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "believe," "may impact," "on track," and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance, an acquisition or our businesses.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P0_S3	In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Those statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P0_S5	Therefore, actual results could differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P0_S6	Some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forward-looking statements include the risks discussed below.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	The impact of United States healthcare reform legislation on our business remains uncertain: In 2010 federal legislation to reform the United States healthcare system was enacted into law.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	The legislation is far-reaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage and improve the quality and reduce the costs of healthcare over time.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P3_S3	We expect the law will have a significant impact upon various aspects of our business operations.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Among other things, the law imposed a 2.3 percent excise tax on medical devices that applies only to United States sales, which are a majority of our medical device products sales; however, in 2015 Congress enacted legislation that suspends the excise tax for 2016 and 2017.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Other provisions of this legislation, including Medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs, comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies, could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P3_S6	Further, we cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will be ultimately implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the United States on our business and results of operations.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We may be adversely affected by product liability claims, unfavorable court decisions or legal settlements: We are exposed to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices, many of which are intended to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We are currently defendants in a number of product liability matters, including those relating to our Rejuvenate and ABGII Modular-Neck hip stems discussed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P4_S2	These matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P4_S3	In addition, we may incur significant legal expenses regardless of whether we are found to be liable.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P4_S4	We are self-insured for product liability-related claims and expenses.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P4_S5	The ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P4_S6	Intellectual property litigation and infringement claims could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling certain of our products: The medical device industry is characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation and, from time to time, we are the subject of claims of potential infringement or misappropriation.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P4_S7	Regardless of outcome, such claims are expensive to defend and divert the time and effort of management and operating personnel from other business issues.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P4_S8	A successful claim or claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could result in payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments or negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products in the affected category.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P4_S9	Dependence on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to such rights may impact offerings in our product portfolios: Our long-term success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P4_S10	If we fail to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property protection, it could allow others to sell products that directly compete with proprietary features in our product portfolio.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	or future patent applications may not result in issued patents.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We are subject to extensive governmental regulation relating to the manufacturing, labeling and marketing of our products: Substantially all of our products are subject to regulation by the FDA and other governmental authorities in the United States and internationally.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted timely for future products, if at all.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations with respect to our products and facilities and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and others to determine compliance with the quality system and medical device reporting regulations and other requirements.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P6_S3	If we fail to fully comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to a range of sanctions, including warning letters, product recalls, the suspension of product manufacturing, monetary fines and criminal prosecution.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P6_S4	We are subject to federal, state and foreign healthcare regulations, including fraud and abuse laws, as well as anti-bribery laws, and could face substantial penalties if we fail to fully comply with such regulations and laws: Our relationships with healthcare professionals, such as physicians, hospitals and those that may market our products, are subject to scrutiny under various state and federal laws often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P6_S5	In addition, the United States and foreign government regulators have increased the enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P6_S6	These laws are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation, which could require us to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if we are found not to be in compliance.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P6_S7	We also must comply with a variety of other laws that protect the privacy of individually identifiable healthcare information and impose extensive tracking and reporting related to all transfers of value provided to certain healthcare professionals.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P6_S8	Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	MARKET RISKS Macroeconomic developments could negatively affect our ability to conduct business in affected regions: Financial difficulties experienced by our customers, distributors, and suppliers could result in product delays and inventory issues; risks to accounts receivable could also include delays in collection and greater bad debt expense.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross border transactions and translation of local currency results into United States dollars: We report our financial results in United States Dollars and approximately 30% of our revenues are denominated in foreign currencies, including the Euro, the British Pound, and the Japanese Yen.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Cross border transactions with external parties and intercompany relationships result in increased exposure to foreign currency exchange effects.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Our results of operations and, in some cases, cash flows, have been and may in the future be adversely affected by movements in foreign currency exchange rates.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P7_S4	While we implement currency hedges to partially reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates; our hedging strategies may not be successful, and our unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P7_S5	In addition, the weakening or strengthening of the United States dollar results in favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the results of our foreign locations are translated into United States dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements and results.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Additional capital that we may require in the future may not be available to us, or only available to us on unfavorable terms: Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including operating requirements, current and future acquisitions and the need to refinance existing debt.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Our ability to issue additional debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected by our debt levels, unfavorable changes in economic conditions generally or uncertainties that affect the capital markets.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating agencies could also adversely affect our access to and cost of financing.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Higher borrowing costs or the inability to access capital markets could adversely affect our ability to support future growth and operating requirements and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P9_S4	BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL RISKS Cost containment measures in the United States and other countries resulting in pricing pressures could have a negative impact on our future operating results: Initiatives sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation and competitive pricing, are ongoing in markets where we do business.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P9_S5	Pricing pressure has also increased due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers, trends toward managed care, the shift towards governments becoming the primary payers of healthcare expenses and government laws and regulations relating to sales and promotion, reimbursement and pricing generally.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P9_S6	Reductions in reimbursement levels or coverage for our products or other cost containment measures, including any that reduce medical procedure volumes, could unfavorably affect our future operating results.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P9_S7	We may be unable to effectively develop and market products against the products of our competitors in a highly competitive industry: Our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by our competitors.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P9_S8	Competitive factors include price, customer service, technology, innovation, quality, reputation and reliability.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P9_S9	Our competition may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, have greater financial, marketing and other resources or be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees and strategic partners.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P9_S10	Given these factors, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue our level of success in the industry.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P9_S11	Competition in the development and improvement of new and existing products is particularly significant and results from time to time in product obsolescence: The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P9_S12	Such marketplace changes may cause some of our products to become obsolete.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P9_S13	If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, a higher level of inventory write downs may result.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We may be unable to maintain adequate working relationships with healthcare professionals: We seek to maintain close working relationships with respected physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist in product research and development.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We rely on these professionals to assist us in the development of proprietary products and product improvements to complement and expand our existing product lines.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If we are unable to maintain these relationships, our ability to develop, market and sell new and improved products could decrease.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our international operations are subject to a number of additional risks and potential costs, including changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs, unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements, differing local product preferences and product requirements, diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations, political and economic instability.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Our results of operations and/or financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks of international operations in an increasingly volatile environment.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We may be unable to capitalize on previous or future acquisitions:
310764_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	In addition to internally developed products, we rely upon investment in new technologies through acquisitions.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Investments in medical technology are inherently risky, and we cannot guarantee that any acquisition will be successful or will not have a material unfavorable impact on us.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P12_S2	These risks include the activities required to integrate new businesses, which may result in the need to allocate more resources to integration and product development activities than originally anticipated, diversion of management time, which could adversely affect management's ability to focus on other projects, the inability to realize the expected benefits, savings or synergies from the acquisition, the loss of key personnel of the acquired company and exposure to unexpected liabilities of the acquired company.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P12_S3	In addition, we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so, which may result in unexpected impairment charges.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P12_S4	We may record future goodwill impairment charges related to one or more of our business units, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations: We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	In evaluating the potential for impairment we make assumptions regarding revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows, tax rates and discount rates.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	These assumptions are uncertain and by nature may vary from actual results.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our results of operations.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Our results of operations could be negatively impacted by future changes in the allocation of income to each of the income tax jurisdictions in which we operate: We operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both in the United States and internationally.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Accordingly, our management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each jurisdiction based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Income tax authorities regularly perform audits of our income tax filings.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P13_S6	Income tax audits associated with the allocation of income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing, product royalty and foreign branch arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P13_S7	If changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates, the related adjustments could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P13_S8	Failure of a key information technology system, process or site and a breach of information security, including a cybersecurity breach or failure of one or more key information technology systems, networks, processes, associated sites or service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation: We rely extensively on information technology (IT) systems to conduct business.

310764_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In addition, our reliance on networks and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third-parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced persistent threats, pose a potential risk to the security of our IT systems, networks and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and our responsibilities to governments.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P15_S3	We have made investments seeking to address these threats, including monitoring of networks and systems, hiring of experts, employee training and security policies for employees and third-party providers; however, because the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P15_S4	If the IT systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly, or if we or one of our third-party providers suffer a loss or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P15_S5	The costs and operational consequences of interruptions in our operations and responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P15_S6	We may be unable to attract and retain key employees: Our sales, technical and other key personnel play an integral role in the development, marketing and selling of new and existing products.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P15_S7	If we are unable to recruit, hire, develop and retain a talented, competitive work force, we may not be able to meet our strategic business objectives.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P15_S8	An inability to successfully manage the implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning ("ERP") system could adversely affect our operations and operating results: We are in the process of implementing a new global ERP system.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P15_S9	This system will replace many of our existing operating and financial systems.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P15_S10	Such an implementation is a major undertaking both financially and from a management and personnel perspective.
310764_16_ITEM1A_P15_S11	Should the system not be implemented successfully, or if the system does not perform in a satisfactory manner, it could be disruptive and adversely affect our operations and results of operations, including our ability to report accurate and timely financial results.
310764_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our corporate headquarters is located in Kalamazoo, Michigan, in a 75,000 square foot owned facility.
310764_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	In addition, we maintain administrative and sales offices and warehousing and distribution facilities in other locations domestically and globally.

310764_16_ITEM7_P12_S8	Gross Profit decreased to 65.7% in 2014 compared to 66.7% in 2013, primarily due to decreases in the selling prices of our products, unfavorable product mix and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates.
310764_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	Research, Development and Engineering Expenses Research, development and engineering expenses represented 6.3% of net sales in 2015 and 2014 compared to 5.9% in 2013.
310764_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	The increased spending levels in 2015 and 2014 were driven by the timing of projects and investments in new technologies.
310764_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2015 decreased to 36.3% from 36.7% in 2014 and 38.4% in 2013.

310764_16_ITEM7_P14_S6	The increase in other expense was primarily driven by higher interest costs on income tax reserves and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes.

310764_16_ITEM7_P15_S3	The impact of foreign currency exchange rates reduced net earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.26 and $0.14 in 2015 and 2014.
310764_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	Non-GAAP Financial Measures We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including percentage sales growth in constant currency; percentage organic sales growth; adjusted gross profit; cost of sales excluding specified items; adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses; adjusted amortization of intangible assets; adjusted operating income; adjusted effective income tax rate; adjusted net earnings; and adjusted net earnings per diluted share (Diluted EPS).
310764_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance.
310764_16_ITEM7_P17_S2	Management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses.
310764_16_ITEM7_P17_S3	Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these non-GAAP financial measures.
310764_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales.
310764_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	Percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates.
310764_16_ITEM7_P18_S2	To measure percentage organic sales growth, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions that affect the comparability and trend of sales.
310764_16_ITEM7_P18_S3	Percentage organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates excluding the impact of acquisitions.
310764_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	To measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings.
310764_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	These adjustments are irregular in timing, may not be indicative of our past and future performance and are therefore excluded to allow investors to better understand underlying operating trends.
310764_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	examples of the types of adjustments that may be included in a period: 1. Acquisition and integration related costs .
310764_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	Costs related to integrating recently acquired businesses and specific costs related to the consummation of the acquisition process.
310764_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	2. Amortization of intangible assets .
310764_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	Periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets.
310764_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	Costs associated with workforce reductions, facility rationalizations and other restructuring activities.
310764_16_ITEM7_P22_S2	Our best estimate of the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve certain product recalls.
310764_16_ITEM7_P22_S3	Our best estimate of the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve certain regulatory matters and other legal settlements.
310764_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	Certain significant and discrete tax items and adjustments to interest expense related to the settlement of certain tax matters.
310764_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names.
310764_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth, gross profit, cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, amortization of intangible assets, operating income, effective income tax rate, net earnings and net earnings per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
310764_16_ITEM7_P24_S2	These non-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures below provide a more complete understanding of our business.
310764_16_ITEM7_P24_S3	We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.
310764_16_ITEM7_P24_S4	The following reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted gross profit; adjusted selling, general and administrative expense; adjusted operating income; adjusted other income (expense), net; adjusted net earnings; adjusted effective tax rate; and adjusted diluted EPS; with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures:

310764_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	The weighted-average basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of non-GAAP Diluted EPS are the same as the weighted-average basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported Diluted EPS.
310764_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	We believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and ready access to capital markets at competitive rates.
310764_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures.
310764_16_ITEM7_P28_S1	Excess operating cash is used first to fund acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses.
310764_16_ITEM7_P28_S2	Other discretionary uses include dividends and share repurchases.
310764_16_ITEM7_P28_S3	As necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities.
310764_16_ITEM7_P28_S4	Our overall cash position shows our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.
310764_16_ITEM7_P28_S5	Operating Activities Cash provided by operations was $899, $1,782, $1,886 in 2015, 2014 and 2013.
310764_16_ITEM7_P28_S6	The decrease in 2015 was primarily due to recall-related payments associated with the Rejuvenate and ABGII recall settlement agreement and the timing of income tax payments.
310764_16_ITEM7_P28_S7	The net of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable resulted in the consumption of $231, $249, and $165 of cash in 2015, 2014 and 2013.
310764_16_ITEM7_P28_S8	Inventory days on hand for 2015 increased by 5 days from 2014 after increasing eight days in 2014.
310764_16_ITEM7_P28_S9	Accounts receivable days sales outstanding for 2015 increased by one day after decreasing one day in 2014.
310764_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	Investing Activities Cash provided by investing activities was $1,956 in 2015 compared to cash used in investing of $1,878 in 2014 and $2,217 in 2013.
310764_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	This change is primarily due to the sale of a portion of our marketable securities in 2015 to make recall-related payments discussed above under Operating Activities.
310764_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	Acquisitions: Acquisitions resulted in cash consumption of $153, $916 and $2,320 in 2015, 2014 and 2013.
310764_16_ITEM7_P30_S1	In 2015 the primary acquisition was CHG, and in 2014 the primary acquisitions were Patient Safety Technologies, Inc., Pivot Medical Inc., Berchtold Holding, AG and Small Bone Innovations, Inc.
310764_16_ITEM7_P30_S2	In 2013 we acquired Trauson Holdings Company Limited and Mako Surgical Corp.
310764_16_ITEM7_P30_S3	Capital expenditures were $270, $233 and $195 in 2015, 2014 and 2013.
310764_16_ITEM7_P30_S4	Capital expenditures in 2015 were primarily related to acquisition integration support, information technology infrastructure upgrades, capacity expansion, new product introductions, innovation and cost savings.
310764_16_ITEM7_P30_S5	Financing Activities Dividends Paid: Dividends paid per common share increased 9.8% to $1.34 per share in 2015 compared to $1.22 per share in 2014, an increase of 15.1% from 2013.
310764_16_ITEM7_P30_S6	Dividends paid per common share and total dividends paid to common shareholders are included in the following table for 2015, 2014 and 2013.
310764_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and overall cost of capital.
310764_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	Net proceeds from borrowings were $48, $1,159 and $1,005 in 2015, 2014 and 2013.
310764_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	In 2015 the proceeds were primarily from the public offerings of notes offset by the payment of certain notes due and paid in January 2015.
310764_16_ITEM7_P33_S2	Proceeds in 2014 were primarily from the public offerings of notes and commercial paper.
310764_16_ITEM7_P33_S3	Refer to Note 9 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
310764_16_ITEM7_P33_S4	Total debt was $4,022 and $3,973 in 2015 and 2014 .
310764_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	Share Repurchases: The total use of cash for share repurchases was $700, $100 and $317 in 2015, 2014 and 2013.
310764_16_ITEM7_P34_S1	We have decided to suspend our share repurchase program through 2016.
310764_16_ITEM7_P34_S2	Liquidity Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $4,079 and $5,000 on December 31, 2015 and 2014 and our current assets exceeded current liabilities by $4,441 and $4,223 on December 31, 2015 and 2014 .
310764_16_ITEM7_P34_S3	We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs, including recall-related payments related to the Rejuvenate and ABG II recalls, from a variety of sources, including cash from operations, commercial paper and existing credit lines.
310764_16_ITEM7_P34_S4	We have raised funds in the capital markets and may continue to do so from time to time.
310764_16_ITEM7_P34_S5	We have strong short-term and long-term debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due.
310764_16_ITEM7_P34_S6	We have existing credit facilities should additional funds be required.
310764_16_ITEM7_P34_S7	On December 31, 2015 we had approximately $1,236 of borrowing capacity available under our existing credit facilities.
310764_16_ITEM7_P34_S8	On December 31, 2015 approximately 46% of our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held in locations outside the United States.
310764_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	In 2014 we announced that we would begin a repatriation program.
310764_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	We completed the program in 2015 and repatriated approximately $1.8 billion to the United States.
310764_16_ITEM7_P35_S2	Our remaining cash held outside the United States is considered to be indefinitely reinvested.
310764_16_ITEM7_P35_S3	We intend to use this cash to expand operations, either organically or through acquisitions outside the United States.
310764_16_ITEM7_P35_S4	We continually evaluate our receivables, particularly in Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece (the Southern European Region).
310764_16_ITEM7_P35_S5	The total net receivables from the Southern European Region were approximately $132 and $154 in 2015 and 2014, including approximately $51 and $78 of sovereign receivables in 2015 and 2014 .
310764_16_ITEM7_P35_S6	We believe that our current reserves related to receivables are adequate and any additional credit risk associated with the Southern European Region is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial position or liquidity.
310764_16_ITEM7_P35_S7	We currently do not have any investments in the sovereign debt instruments of the Southern European Region.
310764_16_ITEM7_P35_S8	Any non-sovereign exposure in these countries is considered immaterial.
310764_16_ITEM7_P35_S9	In 2015 we made recall-related payments of $1,202 under our United States Rejuvenate and ABG II settlement agreement.
310764_16_ITEM7_P35_S10	Refer to Note 8 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
310764_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	We do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.
310764_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND FORWARD-LOOKING CASH REQUIREMENTS As further described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2015 we recorded additional charges to earnings totaling $295 related to the Rejuvenate and ABG II recalls.
310764_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	to be approximately $1,824 ($2,056 before $232 of third-party insurance recoveries) to $2,416.
310764_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	The final outcome of this matter is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict.
310764_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	The ultimate cost to entirely resolve this matter may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	We are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which payments will be made.
310764_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	As further described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on December 31, 2015 we have recorded a liability for uncertain income tax positions of $313.
310764_16_ITEM7_P40_S2	Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits, we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which any income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made.
310764_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	As further described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on December 31, 2015 our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by $240, of which approximately $231 related to plans outside the United States.
310764_16_ITEM7_P41_S1	Due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and potential changes in legislation in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, we are not able to reasonably estimate beyond 2016 the amounts that may be required to fund defined benefit pension plans.
310764_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES In preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application.
310764_16_ITEM7_P42_S1	These include inventory reserves, income taxes, acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets, and legal and other contingencies.
310764_16_ITEM7_P42_S2	We believe these accounting policies and the others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition.
310764_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	We maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs.
310764_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	We make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends.
310764_16_ITEM7_P43_S2	If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.
310764_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	Income Taxes Our annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes.
310764_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements.
310764_16_ITEM7_P46_S1	Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense.
310764_16_ITEM7_P46_S2	These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.
310764_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement.
310764_16_ITEM7_P47_S1	Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred, the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction has already been taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment.
310764_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes.
310764_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	Realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods.
310764_16_ITEM7_P49_S1	Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.
310764_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments.
310764_16_ITEM7_P50_S1	In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority.
310764_16_ITEM7_P50_S2	These differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment.
310764_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes.
310764_16_ITEM7_P51_S1	We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly.
310764_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions.
310764_16_ITEM7_P52_S1	Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
310764_16_ITEM7_P52_S2	Because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events, such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans, could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate.
310764_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	Acquisitions, Goodwill and Intangibles, and Long-Lived Assets We account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting.
310764_16_ITEM7_P53_S1	Under the purchase method, our financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition.
310764_16_ITEM7_P53_S2	In addition, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded on the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill.
310764_16_ITEM7_P53_S3	Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives.
310764_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain.
310764_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets.
310764_16_ITEM7_P55_S1	Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.
310764_16_ITEM7_P55_S2	Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.
310764_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment.
310764_16_ITEM7_P56_S1	With the exception of certain trade names, the majority of our acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer and distributor relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives.
310764_16_ITEM7_P56_S2	Our assessment as to the useful lives of these intangible assets is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, trademark and/or brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarks or brands are sold.
310764_16_ITEM7_P56_S3	Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors.
310764_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life.
310764_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	In certain of our acquisitions, we acquire in-process research and development (IPRD) intangible assets.
310764_16_ITEM7_P58_S1	IPRD is considered to be an indefinite-lived intangible asset until such time as the research is completed (at which time it becomes a determinable-lived intangible asset) or determined to have no future use (at which time it is impaired).
310764_16_ITEM7_P58_S2	The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment.
310764_16_ITEM7_P58_S3	Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles.
310764_16_ITEM7_P58_S4	We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year.
310764_16_ITEM7_P58_S5	We consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill.
310764_16_ITEM7_P58_S6	In certain circumstances, we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability.
310764_16_ITEM7_P58_S7	In those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level.
310764_16_ITEM7_P58_S8	We test individual indefinite-lived intangibles by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value.
310764_16_ITEM7_P58_S9	We determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the income approach.
310764_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows.
310764_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value.
310764_16_ITEM7_P59_S2	Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans.
310764_16_ITEM7_P59_S3	We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants.
310764_16_ITEM7_P59_S4	We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill during the years presented, as our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill fair values exceeded their respective recorded values.
310764_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates and future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values.
310764_16_ITEM7_P61_S1	A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our financial statements.
310764_16_ITEM7_P61_S2	We review our other long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
310764_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level.
310764_16_ITEM7_P62_S1	The undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections.
310764_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique.
310764_16_ITEM7_P63_S1	Assets classified as held for sale, if any, are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
310764_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	Legal and Other Contingencies We are involved in various ongoing proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property, and other matters that are more fully described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_16_ITEM7_P64_S1	The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time.
310764_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory and equitable relief, that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief.
310764_16_ITEM7_P65_S1	For legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management's best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded.
310764_16_ITEM7_P65_S2	The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies.
310764_16_ITEM7_P65_S3	If actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.
310764_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	We are currently self-insured for product liability-related claims and expenses.
310764_16_ITEM7_P66_S1	The ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_16_ITEM7_P66_S2	NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
310764_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	We sell our products globally, as a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak economic conditions or changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
310764_16_ITEM7_P67_S1	Our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the United States dollar; European currencies, in particular the euro, Swiss franc and the British pound; the Japanese yen; the Australian dollar; and the Canadian dollar.
310764_16_ITEM7_P67_S2	We develop and manufacture products in the United States, Canada, Turkey, China, France, Germany, Ireland, Puerto Rico and Switzerland and incur costs in the applicable local currencies.
310764_16_ITEM7_P67_S3	This global deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on our cost of sales.
310764_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	We enter into designated and non-designated forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates.
310764_16_ITEM7_P68_S1	These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products.
310764_16_ITEM7_P68_S2	The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies.
310764_16_ITEM7_P68_S3	All forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period, with resulting gains (losses) for non-designated forward contracts and any ineffectiveness measured on designated forward currency exchange contracts included in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
310764_16_ITEM7_P68_S4	For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
310764_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	We have designated certain long-term intercompany loans payable and forward exchange contracts as net investment hedges of our investments in certain international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency.
310764_16_ITEM7_P69_S1	The effective portion of derivatives designated as net investment hedges are recorded at fair value at each balance sheet date and the change in fair value is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income.
310764_16_ITEM7_P70_S0	The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points.
310764_16_ITEM7_P70_S1	A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar would change the December 31, 2015 fair value by approximately $178.
310764_16_ITEM7_P71_S0	We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on our outstanding forward currency exchange contracts, but we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our counterparties.
310764_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	We have certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged.
310764_16_ITEM7_P72_S1	These investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
310764_16_ITEM7_P72_S2	For 2015 the weakening of foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar decreased the value of these investments in net assets and increased the related foreign currency translation adjustment loss in shareholders' equity by ($390).
310764_16_ITEM7_P72_S3	Refer to Note 3 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

310764_16_ITEM8_P0_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
310764_16_ITEM8_P0_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
310764_16_ITEM8_P1_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
310764_16_ITEM8_P1_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

310764_16_ITEM8_P10_S0	NOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature of Operations: Stryker Corporation (the "Company," "we," "us," or "our") is a global leader in medical technology.
310764_16_ITEM8_P10_S1	Our products include implants used in joint replacement and trauma surgeries; surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems; endoscopic and communications systems; patient handling and emergency medical equipment; neurosurgical, neurovascular and spinal devices; as well as other medical device products used in a variety of medical specialties.
310764_16_ITEM8_P11_S0	Basis of Presentation and Consolidation: The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its subsidiaries.
310764_16_ITEM8_P11_S1	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
310764_16_ITEM8_P11_S2	We have no material interests in variable interest entities and none that require consolidation.
310764_16_ITEM8_P11_S3	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the presentation of our Consolidated Financial Statements and in Note 13 for 2015.
310764_16_ITEM8_P12_S0	Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
310764_16_ITEM8_P12_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
310764_16_ITEM8_P13_S0	Sales are recognized when revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned.
310764_16_ITEM8_P13_S1	Our policy is to recognize revenue when title to the product, ownership and risk of loss transfer to the customer, which can be on the date of shipment, the date of receipt by the customer or, for most orthopaedics products, when we receive appropriate notification that the product has been used or implanted.
310764_16_ITEM8_P13_S2	A provision for estimated sales returns, discounts, rebates and other sales incentives is recorded as a reduction of net sales in the same period that the revenue is recognized.
310764_16_ITEM8_P13_S3	Shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in net sales.
310764_16_ITEM8_P14_S0	Cost of Sales: Cost of sales is primarily comprised of direct materials and supplies consumed in the manufacture of product, as well as manufacturing labor, depreciation expense and direct overhead expense necessary to acquire and convert the purchased materials and supplies into finished product.
310764_16_ITEM8_P14_S1	Cost of sales also includes the cost to distribute products to customers, inbound freight costs, warehousing costs and other shipping and handling activity.
310764_16_ITEM8_P15_S0	Research, Development and Engineering Expenses: Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred.
310764_16_ITEM8_P15_S1	Costs include research, development and engineering activities relating to the development of new products, improvement of existing products, technical support of products and compliance with governmental regulations for the protection of customers and patients.
310764_16_ITEM8_P15_S2	Costs primarily consist of salaries, wages, consulting and depreciation and maintenance of research facilities and equipment.
310764_16_ITEM8_P15_S3	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: Selling, general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of selling expenses, marketing expenses, administrative and other indirect overhead costs, amortization of loaner instrumentation, depreciation and amortization expense of non-manufacturing assets and other miscellaneous operating items.
310764_16_ITEM8_P16_S0	Adjustments to translate those statements into United States dollars are recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI).
310764_16_ITEM8_P17_S0	Transactional exchange gains and losses are included in earnings.
310764_16_ITEM8_P18_S0	Cash Equivalents: Highly liquid investments with remaining stated maturities of three months or less when purchased are considered cash equivalents and recorded at cost.
310764_16_ITEM8_P19_S0	Marketable Securities: Marketable securities consist of marketable debt securities, certificates of deposit and mutual funds.
310764_16_ITEM8_P19_S1	Mutual funds are acquired to offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements and are expected to be used to settle these liabilities.
310764_16_ITEM8_P20_S0	Pursuant to our investment policy, all individual marketable security investments must have a minimum credit quality of single A (Standard Poor s and Fitch) and A2 (Moody s Corporation) at the time of acquisition, while the overall portfolio of marketable securities must maintain a minimum average credit quality of double A (Standard Poor s and Fitch) or Aa (Moody s Corporation).
310764_16_ITEM8_P20_S1	In the event of a rating downgrade below the minimum credit quality subsequent to purchase, the marketable security investment is evaluated to determine the appropriate action to take to minimize the overall risk to our marketable security investment portfolio.
310764_16_ITEM8_P21_S0	Our marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and trading securities.
310764_16_ITEM8_P22_S0	Accounts receivable consists of trade and other miscellaneous receivables.
310764_16_ITEM8_P22_S1	An allowance is maintained for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable.
310764_16_ITEM8_P22_S2	Estimates are made regarding the ability of customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends.
310764_16_ITEM8_P22_S3	Accounts receivable are written off when all reasonable collection efforts are exhausted.
310764_16_ITEM8_P23_S0	Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost generally determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method.
310764_16_ITEM8_P24_S0	For excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell specific products at prices in excess of current carrying costs, reserves are maintained to reduce current carrying cost to market prices.
310764_16_ITEM8_P25_S0	Financial Instruments: Our financial instruments consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, other investments, accounts payable, debt and foreign currency exchange contracts.
310764_16_ITEM8_P25_S1	With the exception of our long-term debt, which is discussed in further detail in Note 9, our estimates of fair value for financial instruments approximate their carrying amounts on December 31, 2015 and 2014 .
310764_16_ITEM8_P26_S0	All marketable securities are recognized at fair value.
310764_16_ITEM8_P26_S1	Adjustments to the fair value of marketable securities that are classified as available-for-sale are recorded as increases or decreases, net of income taxes, within accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) in shareholders equity and adjustments to the fair value of marketable securities that are classified as trading are recorded in earnings.
310764_16_ITEM8_P27_S0	The amortized cost of marketable debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity computed under the effective interest method.
310764_16_ITEM8_P27_S1	Such amortization and interest and realized gains and loses are included in other income (expense), net.
310764_16_ITEM8_P28_S0	The cost of securities sold is determined by the specific identification method.
310764_16_ITEM8_P29_S0	We review declines in the fair value of our investments classified as available-for-sale to determine whether the decline in fair value is an other-than-temporary impairment.
310764_16_ITEM8_P29_S1	The resulting losses from other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale marketable securities are included in earnings.
310764_16_ITEM8_P30_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_16_ITEM8_P31_S0	Derivatives: All derivatives are recognized at fair value and reported on a gross basis.
310764_16_ITEM8_P32_S0	We enter into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting our risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates.
310764_16_ITEM8_P32_S1	These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products.
310764_16_ITEM8_P32_S2	The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies.
310764_16_ITEM8_P32_S3	All forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period, with resulting gains (losses) included in earnings.
310764_16_ITEM8_P33_S0	Forward currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are designed to hedge the variability of cash flows associated with forecasted transactions denominated in a foreign currency that will take place in the future.
310764_16_ITEM8_P33_S1	Changes in value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI on the consolidated balance sheets until earnings are affected by the variability of the underlying cash flows.
310764_16_ITEM8_P33_S2	At that time, the applicable amount of gain or loss from the derivative instrument that is deferred in shareholders equity is reclassified into earnings and is included in other income (expense), net or cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of earnings, depending on the underlying transaction that is being hedged.
310764_16_ITEM8_P34_S0	We report our derivative instruments on a gross basis.
310764_16_ITEM8_P35_S0	Interest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges are being used to manage the exposure to interest rate movements and to reduce borrowing costs by converting fixed-rate debt into floating-rate debt.
310764_16_ITEM8_P35_S1	Under these agreements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.
310764_16_ITEM8_P36_S0	For derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges of our foreign operations, the gain or loss is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment within AOCI together with the offsetting loss or gain of the hedged exposure of the underlying foreign operations.
310764_16_ITEM8_P36_S1	Any ineffective portion of the net investment hedges is reported in earnings during the period of change.
310764_16_ITEM8_P37_S0	Hedge effectiveness for equity forward contracts and foreign exchange net investment hedge forward contracts is assessed by comparing changes in fair value due to changes in spot rates for both the derivative and the hedged item.
310764_16_ITEM8_P38_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost.
310764_16_ITEM8_P38_S1	Depreciation is generally computed by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of three to 30 years for buildings and improvements and three to ten years for machinery and equipment.
310764_16_ITEM8_P39_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of tangible net assets of acquired businesses at the acquisition date, after amounts allocated to other identifiable intangible assets.
310764_16_ITEM8_P39_S1	Factors that contribute to the recognition of goodwill include synergies that are specific to our business and not available to other market participants and are expected to increase revenues and profits; acquisition of a talented workforce; cost savings opportunities; the strategic benefit of expanding our presence in core and adjacent markets; and diversifying our product portfolio.
310764_16_ITEM8_P40_S0	The fair values of other identifiable intangible assets are primarily determined using the income approach.
310764_16_ITEM8_P41_S0	or distributor patronage) and trademarks and patents.
310764_16_ITEM8_P42_S0	Intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of four to 40 years.
310764_16_ITEM8_P42_S1	Certain acquired trade names are considered to have indefinite lives and are not amortized, but are assessed annually for potential impairment as described below.
310764_16_ITEM8_P43_S0	In certain of our acquisitions, we acquire in-process research and development (IPRD) which are indefinite-lived intangible assets.
310764_16_ITEM8_P43_S1	IPRD where research has been completed becomes a determinable-lived intangible asset and IPRD determined to have no future use becomes impaired.
310764_16_ITEM8_P44_S0	Goodwill, Intangibles and Long-Lived Asset Impairment Tests: We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year.
310764_16_ITEM8_P44_S1	We consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill.
310764_16_ITEM8_P44_S2	In certain circumstances, we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability.
310764_16_ITEM8_P44_S3	Indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested at least annually for impairment by comparing the individual carrying values to the fair value.
310764_16_ITEM8_P44_S4	We review long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
310764_16_ITEM8_P44_S5	The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows.
310764_16_ITEM8_P44_S6	Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the asset's useful life based on updated projections.
310764_16_ITEM8_P44_S7	If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique.
310764_16_ITEM8_P45_S0	Assets classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
310764_16_ITEM8_P46_S0	Share-Based Compensation: We use share based compensation in the form of stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance-based restricted stock units (PSUs).
310764_16_ITEM8_P47_S0	Compensation expense is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the grant date.
310764_16_ITEM8_P47_S1	Compensation expense recognized reflects an estimate of the number of awards expected to vest after taking into consideration an estimate of award forfeitures based on actual experience and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the period required to obtain full vesting.
310764_16_ITEM8_P47_S2	Management expectations related to the achievement of performance goals associated with PSU grants is assessed regularly and that assessment is used to determine whether PSU grants are expected to vest.
310764_16_ITEM8_P47_S3	If performance-based milestones related to PSU grants are not met or not expected to be met, any compensation expense recognized to date associated with grants that are not expected to vest will be reversed.
310764_16_ITEM8_P48_S0	Income Taxes: Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted income tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.
310764_16_ITEM8_P48_S1	Deferred income tax benefits generally represent the change in net deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year.
310764_16_ITEM8_P48_S2	Other amounts result from adjustments related to acquisitions and foreign currency as appropriate.
310764_16_ITEM8_P49_S0	We operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both within the United States and internationally.
310764_16_ITEM8_P50_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_16_ITEM8_P51_S0	Income tax authorities in these jurisdictions regularly perform audits of our income tax filings.
310764_16_ITEM8_P51_S1	Income tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing, product royalty and foreign branch arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates.
310764_16_ITEM8_P52_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In April 2015 the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.
310764_16_ITEM8_P52_S1	This update requires an entity to present debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those fiscal years.
310764_16_ITEM8_P52_S2	We adopted this standard on January 1, 2016 and do not expect it to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_16_ITEM8_P53_S0	In May 2014 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
310764_16_ITEM8_P53_S1	This guidance, which is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, outlines a single, comprehensive model for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers.
310764_16_ITEM8_P53_S2	We plan to adopt this standard on January 1, 2018.
310764_16_ITEM8_P53_S3	We are still evaluating what impact, if any, that the standard will have on our financial statements.
310764_16_ITEM8_P54_S0	On February 1, 2016 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Sage Products, LLC (Sage) in an all cash transaction for $ 2,775 .
310764_16_ITEM8_P55_S0	Sage develops, manufactures and distributes disposable products targeted at reducing "Never Events," primarily in the intensive care unit and MedSurg hospital unit setting.
310764_16_ITEM8_P55_S1	Sage s products include solutions for oral care, skin preparation and protection, patient cleaning and hygiene, turning and positioning devices and heel care boots.
310764_16_ITEM8_P55_S2	This transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of 2016.
310764_16_ITEM8_P56_S0	NOTE 4 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1 Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
310764_16_ITEM8_P56_S1	Level 2 Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
310764_16_ITEM8_P56_S2	Level 3 Unobservable inputs reflecting our assumptions or external inputs from active markets.
310764_16_ITEM8_P57_S0	When applying fair value principles in the valuation of assets and liabilities, we are required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
310764_16_ITEM8_P57_S1	We calculate the fair value of our Level 1 and Level 2 instruments based on the exchange traded price of similar or identical instruments, where available, or based on other observable inputs taking into account our credit risk and that of our counterparties.
310764_16_ITEM8_P57_S2	Foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate hedges are included in Level 2 as we use inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability.
310764_16_ITEM8_P58_S0	The Level 2 derivative instruments are primarily valued using standard calculations and models that use readily observable market data as their basis.
310764_16_ITEM8_P59_S0	Our Level 3 liabilities represent milestone payments for acquisitions.
310764_16_ITEM8_P59_S1	The fair value of the liability was estimated using a discounted cash flow technique.
310764_16_ITEM8_P59_S2	Significant unobservable inputs to this technique included our probability assessments of occurrence of triggering events, appropriately discounted considering the uncertainties associated with the obligation.
310764_16_ITEM8_P59_S3	We remeasure our assets and liabilities each reporting period and record the changes in fair value within selling, general and administrative expense and the changes in the time value of money within other income (expense), net.
310764_16_ITEM8_P60_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_16_ITEM8_P61_S0	On December 31, 2015 the aggregate difference between the cost and fair value of available-for-sale marketable securities is not material.
310764_16_ITEM8_P61_S1	Interest receivable of $ 2 related to our marketable securities portfolio was recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets.
310764_16_ITEM8_P61_S2	While some investments have been downgraded by rating agencies since their initial purchase, less than 1% of our investments in available-for-sale marketable securities had a credit quality rating of less than A2 (Moody's), A (Standard Poors) and A (Fitch).
310764_16_ITEM8_P61_S3	We do not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, we do not consider these investments to have other-than-temporarily impairment on December 31, 2015 .
310764_16_ITEM8_P62_S0	impaired have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months and the losses are not considered material.
310764_16_ITEM8_P63_S0	The total of interest and marketable securities income was $ 14 , $ 28 , and $ 24 in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 .
310764_16_ITEM8_P63_S1	The amounts are included in other income (expense), net.
310764_16_ITEM8_P64_S0	NOTE 5 - DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS We use operational and economic hedges, foreign currency exchange forward contracts, net investment hedges and interest rate derivative instruments to manage the impact of currency exchange and interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flow.
310764_16_ITEM8_P65_S0	At the inception, the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, fair value hedge or is a free standing derivative.
310764_16_ITEM8_P66_S0	We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes.
310764_16_ITEM8_P66_S1	Non-designated Foreign Exchange Forward Contract Derivatives Derivative forward contracts are used to offset our exposure to the change in value of specific foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
310764_16_ITEM8_P66_S2	These derivatives are not designated as hedges and, therefore, changes in the value of these forward contracts are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related changes in value of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
310764_16_ITEM8_P67_S0	The estimated fair value of our forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points.
310764_16_ITEM8_P68_S0	Designated Foreign Exchange Forward Contract Derivatives We use a layered hedging program to hedge select anticipated foreign currency cash flows to reduce volatility in both cash flows and reported earnings.
310764_16_ITEM8_P68_S1	These foreign exchange contracts generally have maturities up to eighteen months.
310764_16_ITEM8_P69_S0	For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of AOCI and reclassified into other income (expense), net or cost of sales within earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
310764_16_ITEM8_P69_S1	Cash flows associated with these hedges are included in cash from operations in the same category as the cash flows from the items being hedged.
310764_16_ITEM8_P70_S0	We have designated certain long-term intercompany loans payable and forward exchange contracts as net investment hedges of our investments in certain international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency.
310764_16_ITEM8_P70_S1	The effective portion of derivatives designated as net investment hedges are recorded at fair value at each balance sheet date and the change in fair value is recorded as a component of AOCI.
310764_16_ITEM8_P70_S2	On December 31, 2015 the total after-tax amount in AOCI related to our designated net investment hedges was $ 21 .
310764_16_ITEM8_P71_S0	For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a net investment hedge, the effective portion of the derivative's gain or loss is reported as a component of OCI and recorded in AOCI.
310764_16_ITEM8_P72_S0	We use the forward method to measure ineffectiveness.
310764_16_ITEM8_P72_S1	Under this method, for each reporting period, the change in the carrying value of the Euro-denominated amounts due to remeasurement of the effective portion is reported as a component of AOCI and the remaining change in the carrying value of the ineffective portion, if any, is recognized in other income (expense), net.
310764_16_ITEM8_P73_S0	The gain or loss related to settled net investment hedges will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated.
310764_16_ITEM8_P73_S1	We evaluate the effectiveness of our net investment hedges quarterly and did not record any ineffectiveness in 2015.
310764_16_ITEM8_P74_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_16_ITEM8_P75_S0	We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on our outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our counterparties.
310764_16_ITEM8_P75_S1	Should a counterparty default, our maximum exposure to loss is the asset balance of the instrument.
310764_16_ITEM8_P76_S0	On December 31, 2015 and 2014 pretax gains on derivatives designated as hedges of $17 and $ 15 , which are recorded in AOCI, are expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next 12 months.
310764_16_ITEM8_P76_S1	This reclassification is primarily due to the sale of inventory that includes previously hedged purchases.
310764_16_ITEM8_P76_S2	There have been no ineffective portions of derivatives that have resulted in gains or losses in any of the periods presented.
310764_16_ITEM8_P77_S0	Interest Rate Risk on Future Debt Issuance Forward starting interest rate derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are used to manage the exposure to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuance and refinancing of debt.
310764_16_ITEM8_P77_S1	The effective portion of the gains or losses on forward starting interest rate derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is reported as a component of AOCI.
310764_16_ITEM8_P77_S2	Beginning in the period in which the debt refinancing occurs and the related derivative instruments is terminated, the effective portion of the gains or losses is then reclassified into interest expense over the term of the related debt.
310764_16_ITEM8_P78_S0	On December 31, 2015 we had interest rate swaps with notional amounts of $ 375 designated as forward starting interest rate swaps in anticipation of future debt issuances.
310764_16_ITEM8_P78_S1	The market value of outstanding interest rate swap agreements on December 31, 2015 was $ 4 , which is recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities with an offsetting amount recorded in AOCI.
310764_16_ITEM8_P78_S2	Upon the probable issuance of the debt, these amounts will be released to interest expense over the term of the debt.
310764_16_ITEM8_P78_S3	The cash flow effect of this hedge is recorded in cash flow from operations.
310764_16_ITEM8_P79_S0	Fair Value Hedges Interest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges are used to manage the exposure to interest rate movements and to reduce borrowing costs by converting fixed-rate debt into floating-rate debt.
310764_16_ITEM8_P80_S0	specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.
310764_16_ITEM8_P80_S1	On December 31, 2015 we had interest rate swaps in gross notional amounts of $500 designated as fair value hedges of underlying fixed rate obligations representing a portion of our $600 senior unsecured notes due in 2024.
310764_16_ITEM8_P80_S2	There was no hedge ineffectiveness recorded as a result of these fair value hedges.
310764_16_ITEM8_P81_S0	We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on our outstanding derivative instruments but do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our counterparties.
310764_16_ITEM8_P81_S1	Should a counterparty default, our maximum exposure to loss is the asset balance of the instrument.
310764_16_ITEM8_P82_S0	In January 2015 we acquired certain assets of CHG Hospital Beds, Inc. (CHG).
310764_16_ITEM8_P82_S1	CHG designs, manufactures and markets low-height hospital beds and related accessories.

310764_16_ITEM8_P84_S5	These acquisitions enhance our product offerings within our MedSurg segment.
310764_16_ITEM8_P84_S6	The measurement periods for our acquisitions in 2014 have been completed.
310764_16_ITEM8_P85_S0	Revisions to the original purchase price allocation were not material.
310764_16_ITEM8_P85_S1	The purchase price allocations for the 2015 acquisitions were based upon preliminary valuations, and our estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period.
310764_16_ITEM8_P85_S2	On December 31, 2015 management is in the process of verifying data and finalizing information related to the 2015 acquisitions and the valuation and recording of identifiable intangible assets, deferred income taxes and the corresponding effect on the value of goodwill.
310764_16_ITEM8_P86_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_16_ITEM8_P87_S0	NOTE 7 - GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS We completed our annual impairment tests of goodwill in 2015 and 2014 and concluded in each year that no impairments exist.

310764_16_ITEM8_P89_S0	During 2015 we placed certain in process research and development assets into service as a result of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) clearance of our Mako total knee application.
310764_16_ITEM8_P89_S1	NOTE 8 - CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS We are involved in various ongoing proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor, intellectual property and other matters that are more fully described below.
310764_16_ITEM8_P89_S2	The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time.
310764_16_ITEM8_P90_S0	In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages as well as other compensatory and equitable relief that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief.
310764_16_ITEM8_P91_S0	For legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management's best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, is recorded.
310764_16_ITEM8_P91_S1	The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies.
310764_16_ITEM8_P91_S2	If actual outcomes are less favorable than those estimated by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.
310764_16_ITEM8_P92_S0	We are self-insured for product liability-related claims and expenses.
310764_16_ITEM8_P92_S1	The ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_16_ITEM8_P92_S2	In June 2012 we voluntarily recalled our Rejuvenate and ABG II Modular-Neck hip stems and terminated global distribution of these hip products.
310764_16_ITEM8_P92_S3	Product liability lawsuits relating to this voluntary recall have been filed against us.
310764_16_ITEM8_P93_S0	On November 3, 2014 we announced that we had entered into a settlement agreement to compensate eligible United States patients who had revision surgery to replace their Rejuvenate and/or ABG II Modular-Neck hip stem prior to that date.
310764_16_ITEM8_P93_S1	We continue to offer support for recall-related care and reimburse patients who are not eligible to enroll in the settlement program for testing and treatment services, including any necessary revision surgeries.
310764_16_ITEM8_P93_S2	In addition, some lawsuits will remain and we will continue to defend against them.
310764_16_ITEM8_P93_S3	Based on the information that has been received, the actuarially determined range of probable loss to resolve this matter globally is estimated to be approximately $ 1,824 ($ 2,056 before $ 232 of third-party insurance recoveries) to $ 2,416 .
310764_16_ITEM8_P93_S4	In 2015 we recorded additional charges to earnings of $ 295 , net of insurance recoveries, representing the excess of the minimum of the range over the previously recorded reserves.
310764_16_ITEM8_P93_S5	In 2015 we made recall-related payments totaling $ 1,202 under the United States Rejuvenate and ABG II settlement agreement.
310764_16_ITEM8_P93_S6	The final outcome of this matter is dependent on many factors that are difficult to predict including the number of enrollees in the settlement program and the total awards to them, the number and costs of patients not eligible for the settlement program who seek testing and treatment services and require revision surgery and the number and actual costs to resolve the remaining lawsuits.
310764_16_ITEM8_P93_S7	Accordingly, the ultimate cost to resolve this entire matter globally may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_16_ITEM8_P94_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_16_ITEM8_P95_S0	In 2010 we filed a lawsuit in federal court against Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (Zimmer), alleging that a Zimmer product infringed three of our patents.
310764_16_ITEM8_P95_S1	In 2013 following a jury trial favorable to us, the trial judge entered a final judgment that, among other things, awarded us damages of $ 76 and ordered Zimmer to pay us enhanced damages.
310764_16_ITEM8_P95_S2	In December 2014 the Federal Circuit affirmed the damages awarded to us, reversed the order for enhanced damages and remanded the issue of attorney fees to the trial court.
310764_16_ITEM8_P95_S3	The Federal Circuit denied our petition for a rehearing en banc on the issue of enhanced damages but on October 19, 2015 the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear our appeal on this issue.
310764_16_ITEM8_P95_S4	In May 2015 the trial court entered a stipulated final judgment that, among other things, required Zimmer to pay us the base amount of damages and interest, while the issues of enhanced damages and attorney fees continue to be pursued.
310764_16_ITEM8_P95_S5	In 2015 we received payment of $ 54 , net of legal costs, which has been recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses.
310764_16_ITEM8_P96_S0	In April 2011 Hill-Rom Company, Inc. and affiliated entities (Hill-Rom) brought a lawsuit against us alleging infringement under United States patent laws with respect to nine patents related to electrical network communications for hospital beds.
310764_16_ITEM8_P96_S1	On March 31, 2015 the court granted the parties joint motion to dismiss with prejudice the claims and counterclaims associated with three of these patents.
310764_16_ITEM8_P96_S2	The case has been stayed with respect to the remaining six patents, which currently are under reexamination by the United States Patent Office.
310764_16_ITEM8_P96_S3	The ultimate resolution of this matter cannot be predicted and it is not possible at this time for us to estimate any probable loss or range of probable losses; however, the ultimate result could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_16_ITEM8_P97_S0	We have purchase commitments for materials, supplies, services and property, plant and equipment as part of the normal course of business.

310764_16_ITEM8_P99_S6	Substantially all of our long-term debt is classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because the fair value of the debt is estimated based on rates with identical terms and maturities, using quoted active market prices and yields, taking into account the underlying terms of the debt instruments.
310764_16_ITEM8_P100_S0	Interest expense, including required fees incurred on outstanding debt and credit facilities, which is included in other expense totaled $108 , $113 , and $83 in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 .

310764_16_ITEM8_P104_S2	We measure the cost of employee stock options based on the grant-date fair value and recognize that cost using the straight-line method over the period during which a recipient is required to provide services in exchange for the options, typically the vesting period.
310764_16_ITEM8_P104_S3	The weighted-average fair value per share of options is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
310764_16_ITEM8_P105_S0	The risk-free interest rate for periods within the expected life of options granted is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
310764_16_ITEM8_P106_S0	Expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock.
310764_16_ITEM8_P106_S1	The expected option life, representing the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, is based on historical option exercise and employee termination data.
310764_16_ITEM8_P107_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value, which represents the cumulative difference between the fair market value of the underlying common stock and the option exercise prices, of options exercised was $ 98 , $113 , and $97 during 2015, 2014 and 2013 .

310764_16_ITEM8_P108_S0	We grant RSUs to key employees and non-employee directors and PSUs to certain key employees under our long-term incentive plans.
310764_16_ITEM8_P108_S1	The fair value of RSUs is determined based on the number of shares granted and the closing quoted price of our common stock on the day prior to the date of grant, adjusted for the fact that RSUs do not include anticipated dividends.
310764_16_ITEM8_P108_S2	RSUs generally vest in one-third increments over a three-year period and are settled in stock.
310764_16_ITEM8_P108_S3	PSUs are earned over a three-year performance cycle and vest in March of the year following the end of that performance cycle.
310764_16_ITEM8_P109_S0	relative to pre-established goals during that three-year performance cycle.

310764_16_ITEM8_P113_S1	A portion of our retirement plan expense under the defined contribution plans is funded with Stryker common stock.
310764_16_ITEM8_P114_S0	The use of Stryker common stock represents a non-cash operating activity that is not reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
310764_16_ITEM8_P115_S0	Defined Benefit Plans Certain of our subsidiaries have both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans covering some or all of their employees.
310764_16_ITEM8_P115_S1	Substantially all of the defined benefit pension plans have projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets.
310764_16_ITEM8_P115_S2	The discount rates were selected using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds on December 31 that would provide the necessary cash flows to match our projected benefit payments.

310764_16_ITEM8_P120_S0	Our Level 3 pension plan assets (See Note 4 for an explanation of our fair value hierarchy) consist primarily of guaranteed investment contracts with insurance companies.
310764_16_ITEM8_P120_S1	The insurance contracts guarantee us principal repayment and a fixed rate of return.
310764_16_ITEM8_P121_S0	Our valuation of Level 3 assets is based on third-party actuarial valuations that are an estimation of the surrender value of the guaranteed investment contract between us and the insurance company.
310764_16_ITEM8_P121_S1	The surrender value equals the actuarial value of the notional investments underlying the guaranteed investment contract, using the actuarial assumptions as stated in the guaranteed investment contract.
310764_16_ITEM8_P122_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.

310764_16_ITEM8_P131_S0	It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change due to one or more of the following events in the next twelve months: expiring statutes, audit activity, tax payments, competent authority proceedings related to transfer pricing or final decisions in matters that are the subject of controversy in various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing, product royalty and foreign branch arrangements.
310764_16_ITEM8_P131_S1	We are not able to reasonably estimate the amount or the future periods in which changes in unrecognized tax benefits may be resolved; however, we anticipate certain unrecognized tax benefits related to some examinations to be resolved within the next twelve months.

310764_16_ITEM8_P133_S0	In the normal course of business, income tax authorities in various income tax jurisdictions both within the United States and internationally conduct routine audits of our income tax returns filed in prior years.
310764_16_ITEM8_P133_S1	These audits are generally designed to determine if individual income tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretations of complex income tax regulations regarding the allocation of income to the various income tax jurisdictions.
310764_16_ITEM8_P133_S2	Income tax years are open from 2010 through the current year for the United States federal jurisdiction; income tax years open for our other major jurisdictions range from 2005 through the current year.

310764_16_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Stryker Corporation s management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on December 31, 2015 .
310764_16_ITEM9A_P2_S2	In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) .
310764_16_ITEM9A_P2_S3	Based on that assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.
310764_16_ITEM9A_P3_S0	The internal controls over financial reporting of an acquired business are eligible for a one year exclusion as permitted by Securities and Exchange Commission Staff interpretive guidance.
310764_16_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Accordingly, management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of CHG and other 2015 acquisitions which are included in the December 31, 2015 consolidated financial statements of Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries.

310764_16_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
310764_16_ITEM9A_P5_S2	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
310764_16_ITEM9A_P5_S3	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
310764_16_ITEM9A_P5_S4	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
310764_16_ITEM9A_P5_S5	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
310764_16_ITEM9A_P6_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
310764_16_ITEM9A_P6_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
310764_16_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
310764_16_ITEM9A_P6_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
310764_16_ITEM9A_P7_S0	As indicated in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of CHG and other acquisitions which are included in the December 31, 2015 consolidated financial statements of Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries and constituted 0.2% and 0.3% of total assets and shareholders' equity, respectively, as of December 31, 2015 and 0.3% and (0.1%) of revenues and net earnings, respectively, for the year then ended.

310764_16_ITEM15_P685_S1	The other terms of the PSUs shall also be appropriately amended as may be necessary to reflect the foregoing events.
310764_16_ITEM15_P685_S2	In the event there shall be any other change in the number or kind of the outstanding Shares, or of any stock or other securities into which such Shares shall have been exchanged, then if the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, determine that such change equitably requires an adjustment in the PSUs, such adjustment shall be made in accordance with such determination.
310764_16_ITEM15_P686_S0	(b) Fractional Shares resulting from any adjustment in the PSUs may be settled in cash or otherwise as the Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion.

310764_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	The member states of the European Union (EU) adopted the European Medical Device Directives, which form a single set of medical device regulations for all EU member countries.
310764_17_ITEM1_P28_S1	These regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member countries to meet certain quality system requirements and obtain CE marking for their products.
310764_17_ITEM1_P28_S2	We have authorization to apply the CE marking to substantially all of our products.
310764_17_ITEM1_P28_S3	In addition, we comply with the unique regulatory requirements of each of the countries in Europe and other countries in which we market our products.
310764_17_ITEM1_P28_S4	Initiatives sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare expenses generally and hospital costs in particular, including price regulation and competitive pricing, are ongoing in markets where we do business.
310764_17_ITEM1_P28_S5	It is not possible to predict at this time the long-term impact of such cost containment measures on our future business.
310764_17_ITEM1_P28_S6	In addition, business practices in the healthcare industry are scrutinized, particularly in the United States, by federal and state government agencies, and the resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.
310764_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	Employees On December 31, 2016 we had approximately 33,000 employees globally.
310764_17_ITEM1_P29_S1	The number of employees increased from 2015 largely due to our Sage and Physio acquisitions.
310764_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	Certain international employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
310764_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	We believe that we maintain positive relationships with our employees globally.
310764_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	Each of our executive officers was elected by our Board of Directors to serve in the office indicated until the first meeting of the Board of Directors following the annual meeting of shareholders in 2017 or until a successor is chosen and qualified or until his or her resignation or removal.
310764_17_ITEM1_P32_S1	Each of our executive officers held the position above or served Stryker in various executive or administrative capacities for at least five years, except for Ms. Fink and Mr. Sagar.
310764_17_ITEM1_P32_S2	Prior to joining Stryker in October 2013, Ms. Fink held a variety of senior level human resources roles for the previous six years at Johnson Johnson, most recently as the Worldwide Vice President, Human Resources of Ethicon.
310764_17_ITEM1_P32_S3	While at Stryker, Ms. Fink held two different senior level Human Resource roles.

310764_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	This report contains statements referring to us that are not historical facts and are considered "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These statements, which are intended to take advantage of the "safe harbor" provisions of the Reform Act, are based on current projections about operations, industry conditions, financial condition and liquidity.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Words that identify forward-looking statements include words such as "may," "could," "will," "should," "possible," "plan," "predict," "forecast," "potential," "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "believe," "may impact," "on track," "goal," "strategy" and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance, an acquisition or our businesses.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P0_S3	In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Those statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P0_S5	Therefore, actual results could differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P0_S6	Some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forward-looking statements include the risks discussed below.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties discussed below that could materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem not to be material may also materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P1_S2	LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS Current economic and political conditions make tax rules in any jurisdiction subject to significant change: Proposals for broad reform of the existing United States corporate tax system are under evaluation by various legislative and administrative bodies.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We cannot predict the overall impact that such proposals may have on our business.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	In addition, further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise, including as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
310764_17_ITEM1A_P3_S2	The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, has issued recommendations that, in some cases, would make substantial changes to numerous long-standing tax positions and principles.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P3_S3	These contemplated changes, to the extent adopted by OECD members and/or other countries, could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The impact of United States healthcare reform legislation on our business remains uncertain: In 2010 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	While the provisions of the ACA are intended to expand access to health insurance coverage and improve the quality of healthcare over time, other provisions of the legislation, including Medicare provisions aimed at decreasing costs, comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies, are having a meaningful effect on the way healthcare is developed and delivered and could have a significant effect on our business.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Among other things, the ACA imposed a 2.3 percent excise tax on medical devices that applies only to United States sales, which are a majority of our medical device sales; however, Congress suspended the excise tax for 2016 and 2017.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P4_S3	We are unable to predict whether the suspension will be continued beyond 2017.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P4_S4	We also face uncertainties that might result from modification or repeal of any of the provisions of the ACA, including as a result of current and future executive orders and legislative actions.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P4_S5	We cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the United States may have on our business.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We are subject to extensive governmental regulation relating to the manufacturing, labeling and marketing of our products: Our products are subject to extensive and evolving regulations and rigorous regulatory enforcement by the FDA and other governmental authorities in the United States and internationally.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted timely.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P5_S2	We have ongoing responsibilities under the laws and regulations applicable to our products and facilities and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and other governmental authorities to determine compliance with the quality system and medical device reporting regulations and other requirements.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P5_S3	If we fail to fully comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to a range of sanctions, including substantial fines, warning letters that require corrective action, product seizures, recalls, the suspension of product manufacturing, revocation of approvals, exclusion from future participation in government healthcare programs, substantial fines and criminal prosecution.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P5_S4	We are subject to federal, state and foreign healthcare regulations including anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, and could face substantial penalties if we fail to fully comply with such regulations and laws: The relationships that we and our distributors and others that market our products have with healthcare professionals, such as physicians and hospitals, are subject to scrutiny under various state and federal laws often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P5_S5	In addition, the United States and foreign government regulators have increased the enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	laws that protect the privacy of individually identifiable healthcare information and impose extensive tracking and reporting related to all transfers of value provided to certain healthcare professionals.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	These laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation and we could be required to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if we are found not to be in compliance.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment of current or former employees and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We may be adversely affected by product liability claims, unfavorable court decisions or legal settlements: We are exposed to potential product liability risks inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices, many of which are implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We are currently defendants in a number of product liability matters, including those relating to our Rejuvenate and ABGII Modular-Neck hip stems discussed in Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P7_S2	These matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P7_S3	In addition, we may incur significant legal expenses regardless of whether we are found to be liable.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P7_S4	We are self-insured for product liability-related claims and expenses.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Intellectual property litigation and infringement claims could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling certain of our products: The medical device industry is characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation and, from time to time, we are the subject of claims of infringement or misappropriation.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P7_S6	Regardless of outcome, such claims are expensive to defend and divert management and operating personnel from other business issues.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P7_S7	A successful claim or claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could result in payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments or negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products in the affected category.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P7_S8	Dependence on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to such rights may impact offerings in our product portfolios: Our long-term success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P7_S9	If we fail to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property protection, it could allow others to sell products that directly compete with proprietary features in our product portfolio.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P7_S10	Also, our issued patents may be subject to claims challenging their validity and scope and raising other issues.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P7_S11	In addition, currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	MARKET RISKS Macroeconomic developments could negatively affect our ability to conduct business in affected regions: Financial difficulties experienced by our customers, distributors and suppliers could result in product delays and inventory issues; risks to accounts receivable could also include delays in collection and greater bad debt expense.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We have exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross border transactions and translation of local currency results into United States Dollars: We report our financial results in United States Dollars and 27% of our net sales are denominated in foreign currencies, including the Euro, the British Pound and the Japanese Yen.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Cross border transactions with external parties and intercompany relationships result in increased exposure to foreign currency exchange effects.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P8_S3	While we use derivative instruments to manage the impact of currency exchange; our hedging strategies may not be successful, and our unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	strengthening of the United States Dollar results in favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the results of our foreign locations are translated into United States Dollars.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Additional capital that we may require in the future may not be available to us or may only be available to us on unfavorable terms: Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including operating requirements, current and future acquisitions and the need to refinance existing debt.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Our ability to issue additional debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected by our debt levels, unfavorable changes in economic conditions generally or uncertainties that affect the capital markets.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating agencies could also adversely affect our access to and cost of financing.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Higher borrowing costs or the inability to access capital markets could adversely affect our ability to support future growth and operating requirements.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P10_S5	We are subject to cost containment measures in the United States and other countries resulting in pricing pressures: Initiatives sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector to control healthcare costs, including price regulation and competitive pricing, are ongoing in markets where we do business.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P10_S6	Pricing pressure has also increased due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers, trends toward managed care, the shift toward governments becoming the primary payers of healthcare expenses, reduction in reimbursement levels and medical procedure volumes and government laws and regulations relating to sales and promotion, reimbursement and pricing generally.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We operate in a highly competitive industry in which competition in the development and improvement of new and existing products is significant: The markets in which we compete are highly competitive.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	New products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis and our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by our competitors, who may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, have greater financial, marketing and other resources or be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees and strategic partners.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We may be unable to maintain adequate working relationships with healthcare professionals: We seek to maintain close working relationships with respected physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist in product research and development.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P11_S3	We rely on these professionals to assist us in the development and improvement of proprietary products.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P11_S4	If we are unable to maintain these relationships, our ability to develop, market and sell new and improved products could be adversely affected.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P11_S5	We are subject to additional risks associated with our extensive international operations: We develop, manufacture and distribute our products globally.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P11_S6	Our international operations are subject to additional risks and potential costs, including changes in reimbursement, changes in regulatory requirements, differing local product preferences and product requirements, diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations, and political and economic instability.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P11_S7	Our business could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks of international operations in an increasingly volatile environment.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We may be unable to capitalize on previous or future acquisitions:
310764_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	In addition to internally developed products, we invest in new products and technologies through acquisitions.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Such investments are inherently risky, and we cannot guarantee that any acquisition will be successful or will not have a material unfavorable impact on us.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	The risks include the activities required and resources allocated to integrate new businesses, diversion of management time that could adversely affect management's ability to focus on other projects, the inability to realize the expected benefits, savings or synergies from the acquisition, the loss of key personnel and exposure to unexpected liabilities of acquired companies.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P13_S3	In addition, we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become or remain profitable.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P13_S4	We may incur goodwill impairment charges related to one or more of our business units: We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P13_S5	In evaluating the potential for impairment we make assumptions regarding revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows, tax rates and discount rates.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P13_S6	These assumptions are uncertain and by nature may vary from actual results.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P13_S7	A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We could be negatively impacted by future changes in the allocation of income to each of the income tax jurisdictions in which we operate: We operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both in the United States and internationally.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Accordingly, our management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each jurisdiction based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Income tax authorities regularly perform audits of our income tax filings.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Income tax audits associated with the allocation of income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing, product royalty and foreign branch arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We could experience a failure of a key information technology system, process or site or a breach of information security, including a cybersecurity breach or failure of one or more key information technology systems, networks, processes, associated sites or service providers: We rely extensively on information technology (IT) systems to conduct business.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In addition, we rely on networks and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third-parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats pose potential risks to the security of our IT systems, networks and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	While we have made investments seeking to address these threats, including monitoring of networks and systems, hiring of experts, employee training and security policies for employees and third-party providers, the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time and we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P16_S2	If our IT systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly, or we or one of our third-party providers suffer a loss or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	An inability to successfully manage the implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning ("ERP") system could adversely affect our operations and operating results: We are in the process of implementing a new global ERP system.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	This system will replace many of our existing operating and financial systems.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Such an implementation is a major undertaking, both financially and from a management and personnel perspective.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of our new ERP system could adversely affect our ability to process orders, ship products, provide services and customer support, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P18_S4	We may be unable to attract and retain key employees: Our sales, technical and other key personnel play an integral role in the development, marketing and selling of new and existing products.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P18_S5	If we are unable to recruit, hire, develop and retain a talented, competitive work force, we may not be able to meet our strategic business objectives.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Interruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business: We and our suppliers have manufacturing sites all over the world; however, the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more plants.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P18_S7	Damage to these facilities or issues in our manufacturing arising from a failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures, compliance concerns relating to the quality systems regulation, equipment breakdown or malfunction or other factors could adversely affect the availability of our products.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P18_S8	In the event of an interruption in manufacturing, we may be unable to move quickly to alternate means of producing affected products to meet customer demand.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P18_S9	In the event of a significant interruption, we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due to the need for regulatory approvals.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P18_S10	We may experience loss of market share, additional expense and harm to our reputation.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P18_S11	We use a variety of raw materials, components or devices in our global supply chains, production and distribution processes; significant shortages or price increases could increase our operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the competitive position of our products: Our reliance on certain suppliers to secure raw materials, components and finished devices exposes us to product shortages and unanticipated increases in prices.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P18_S12	In addition, several raw materials, components, and finished devices are procured from a sole-source due to the quality considerations, unique intellectual property considerations or constraints associated with regulatory requirements.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P18_S13	If sole-source suppliers are acquired or were unable or unwilling to deliver these materials, we may not be able to manufacture or have available one or more products during such period of unavailability and our business could suffer.
310764_17_ITEM1A_P18_S14	In certain cases we may not be able to establish additional or replacement suppliers for such materials in a timely or cost effective manner, largely as a result of FDA and other regulations that require, among other things, validation of materials and components prior to their use in our products.
310764_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our corporate headquarters is located in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and we maintain administrative and sales offices and warehousing and distribution facilities in other locations domestically and globally.
310764_17_ITEM2_P0_S1	We believe that our properties are suitable and adequate for the manufacture and distribution of our products.
310764_17_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are involved in various proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property, and the matters that are more fully described in Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

310764_17_ITEM5_P1_S3	The manner, timing and amount of repurchases is determined by management based on an evaluation of market conditions, stock price and other factors and is subject to regulatory considerations.
310764_17_ITEM5_P2_S0	Purchases are made from time-to-time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.
310764_17_ITEM5_P2_S1	On December 31, 2016 the total dollar value of shares that could be purchased under our authorized repurchase programs was $1,870 .
310764_17_ITEM5_P2_S2	We issued 100 shares of our common stock in the fourth quarter of 2016 as a performance incentive award to an employee.
310764_17_ITEM5_P2_S3	These shares were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933 based on the conclusion that the awards would not be events of sale within the meaning of Section 2(a)(3) of the Act.

310764_17_ITEM7_P14_S2	Management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses.
310764_17_ITEM7_P14_S3	Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these non-GAAP financial measures.
310764_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales.

310764_17_ITEM7_P32_S8	As a result of the issuance of senior unsecured notes in March 2016, Moody's downgraded our unsecured note ratings to Baa1 from A3, and Standard Poor's downgraded our corporate credit and long-term issue-level rating to A from A+ and our short-term rating to A-1 from A-1+.
310764_17_ITEM7_P32_S9	Nevertheless, we continue to have strong investment-grade short-term and long-term debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as needed.

310764_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES In preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application.
310764_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	These include inventory reserves, income taxes, acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets, and legal and other contingencies.
310764_17_ITEM7_P40_S2	We believe these accounting policies and the others set forth in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition.
310764_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	We maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs.
310764_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	We make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends.
310764_17_ITEM7_P41_S2	If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.
310764_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	Income Taxes Our annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes.
310764_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements.
310764_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense.
310764_17_ITEM7_P43_S2	These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.
310764_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement.
310764_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment was deferred, the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction was taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment.
310764_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes.
310764_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	Realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods.
310764_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.
310764_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments.
310764_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority.
310764_17_ITEM7_P47_S2	These differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment.
310764_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes.
310764_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly.
310764_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions.
310764_17_ITEM7_P49_S1	Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
310764_17_ITEM7_P49_S2	Due to the number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events, such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans, could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate.
310764_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	Acquisitions, Goodwill and Intangibles, and Long-Lived Assets Our financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition.
310764_17_ITEM7_P50_S1	In addition, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded on the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill.
310764_17_ITEM7_P50_S2	Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives.
310764_17_ITEM7_P50_S3	Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant items.
310764_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain.
310764_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets.
310764_17_ITEM7_P52_S1	Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.
310764_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.
310764_17_ITEM7_P54_S1	Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment.
310764_17_ITEM7_P54_S2	With the exception of certain trade names, the majority of our acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer and distributor relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives.
310764_17_ITEM7_P54_S3	Our assessment as to the useful lives of these intangible assets is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, trademark, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarked or branded products are sold.
310764_17_ITEM7_P54_S4	Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors.
310764_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life.
310764_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	In certain of our acquisitions, we acquire in-process research and development (IPRD) intangible assets.
310764_17_ITEM7_P56_S1	IPRD is considered to be an indefinite-lived intangible asset until such time as the research is completed (at which time it becomes a determinable-lived intangible asset) or determined to have no future use (at which time it is impaired).
310764_17_ITEM7_P56_S2	The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment.
310764_17_ITEM7_P56_S3	Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles.
310764_17_ITEM7_P56_S4	We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year.
310764_17_ITEM7_P56_S5	We consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill.
310764_17_ITEM7_P56_S6	In certain circumstances, we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability.
310764_17_ITEM7_P56_S7	In those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level.
310764_17_ITEM7_P56_S8	We test individual indefinite-lived intangibles by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value.
310764_17_ITEM7_P56_S9	We determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the income approach.
310764_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows.
310764_17_ITEM7_P57_S1	Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value.
310764_17_ITEM7_P57_S2	Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans.
310764_17_ITEM7_P57_S3	We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants.
310764_17_ITEM7_P57_S4	We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in the years presented, as our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill fair values exceeded their respective recorded values.
310764_17_ITEM7_P57_S5	Future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates and future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values.
310764_17_ITEM7_P57_S6	A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our results of operations.
310764_17_ITEM7_P57_S7	We review our other long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
310764_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level.
310764_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections.
310764_17_ITEM7_P59_S1	If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique.
310764_17_ITEM7_P59_S2	Assets classified as held for sale, if any, are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
310764_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	Legal and Other Contingencies We are involved in various ongoing proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property, and other matters that are more fully described in Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_17_ITEM7_P60_S1	The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time.
310764_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory and equitable relief, that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief.
310764_17_ITEM7_P61_S1	For legal matters for which management had sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management's best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded.
310764_17_ITEM7_P61_S2	The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies.
310764_17_ITEM7_P61_S3	If actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.
310764_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	We are currently self-insured for product liability-related claims and expenses.
310764_17_ITEM7_P62_S1	The ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
310764_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We sell our products globally and, as a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak economic conditions or changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
310764_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the United States Dollar, European currencies, in particular the Euro, Swiss Franc and the British Pound, the Japanese Yen, the Australian Dollar and the Canadian Dollar.
310764_17_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We develop and manufacture products in the United States, Canada, Turkey, China, France, Germany, Ireland, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Switzerland and incur costs in the applicable local currencies.
310764_17_ITEM7A_P0_S3	This global deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on our cost of sales.
310764_17_ITEM7A_P0_S4	Refer to Notes 1, 3 and 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our use of derivative instruments to mitigate these risks.
310764_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies relative to the United States Dollar would change the December 31, 2016 fair value by approximately $188.
310764_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Stryker Corporation : We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 .
310764_17_ITEM8_P0_S1	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a).
310764_17_ITEM8_P0_S2	These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.
310764_17_ITEM8_P0_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
310764_17_ITEM8_P0_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
310764_17_ITEM8_P0_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
310764_17_ITEM8_P1_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
310764_17_ITEM8_P1_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
310764_17_ITEM8_P1_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
310764_17_ITEM8_P1_S3	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
310764_17_ITEM8_P1_S4	Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
310764_17_ITEM8_P1_S5	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Stryker Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 9, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
310764_17_ITEM8_P2_S0	Anti-dilutive shares excluded from the calculation of dilutive employee stock options were de minimis in all periods.

310764_17_ITEM8_P11_S0	NOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature of Operations: Stryker Corporation (the "Company," "we," "us," or "our") is a global leader in medical technology.
310764_17_ITEM8_P11_S1	Our products include implants used in joint replacement and trauma surgeries; surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems; endoscopic and communications systems; patient handling, emergency medical equipment and intensive care disposable products; neurosurgical, neurovascular and spinal devices; as well as other medical device products used in a variety of medical specialties.
310764_17_ITEM8_P12_S0	Basis of Presentation and Consolidation: The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its subsidiaries.
310764_17_ITEM8_P12_S1	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
310764_17_ITEM8_P12_S2	We have no material interests in variable interest entities and none that require consolidation.
310764_17_ITEM8_P12_S3	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the presentation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in 2016 .
310764_17_ITEM8_P13_S0	Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses in the reporting period.
310764_17_ITEM8_P13_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
310764_17_ITEM8_P14_S0	Sales are recognized when revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned.
310764_17_ITEM8_P14_S1	Our policy is to recognize revenue when title to the product, ownership and risk of loss transfer to the customer, which can be on the date of shipment, the date of receipt by the customer or, for most orthopaedics products, when we receive appropriate notification that the product has been used or implanted.
310764_17_ITEM8_P14_S2	A provision for estimated sales returns, discounts, rebates and other sales incentives is recorded as a reduction of net sales in the same period that the revenue is recognized.
310764_17_ITEM8_P14_S3	Shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in net sales.
310764_17_ITEM8_P15_S0	Cost of Sales: Cost of sales is primarily comprised of direct materials and supplies consumed in the manufacture of product, as well as manufacturing labor, depreciation expense and direct overhead expense necessary to acquire and convert the purchased materials and supplies into finished product.
310764_17_ITEM8_P15_S1	Cost of sales also includes the cost to distribute products to customers, inbound freight costs, warehousing costs and other shipping and handling activity.
310764_17_ITEM8_P16_S0	Research, Development and Engineering Expenses: Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred.
310764_17_ITEM8_P16_S1	Costs include research, development and engineering activities relating to the development of new products, improvement of existing products, technical support of products and compliance with governmental regulations for the protection of customers and patients.
310764_17_ITEM8_P16_S2	Costs primarily consist of salaries, wages, consulting and depreciation and maintenance of research facilities and equipment.
310764_17_ITEM8_P16_S3	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: Selling, general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of selling expenses, marketing expenses, administrative and other indirect overhead costs, amortization of loaner instrumentation, depreciation and amortization expense of non-manufacturing assets and other miscellaneous operating items.
310764_17_ITEM8_P17_S0	Currency Translation: Financial statements of subsidiaries outside the United States generally are measured using the local currency as the functional currency.
310764_17_ITEM8_P18_S0	Transactional exchange gains and losses are included in earnings.
310764_17_ITEM8_P19_S0	Cash Equivalents: Highly liquid investments with remaining stated maturities of three months or less when purchased are considered cash equivalents and recorded at cost.
310764_17_ITEM8_P20_S0	Marketable Securities: Marketable securities consist of marketable debt securities, certificates of deposit and mutual funds.
310764_17_ITEM8_P20_S1	Mutual funds are acquired to offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements and are expected to be used to settle these liabilities.
310764_17_ITEM8_P21_S0	Pursuant to our investment policy, all individual marketable security investments must have a minimum credit quality of single A (Standard Poor s and Fitch) and A2 (Moody s Corporation) at the time of acquisition, while the overall portfolio of marketable securities must maintain a minimum average credit quality of double A (Standard Poor s and Fitch) or Aa (Moody s Corporation).
310764_17_ITEM8_P21_S1	In the event of a rating downgrade below the minimum credit quality subsequent to purchase, the marketable security investment is evaluated to determine the appropriate action to take to minimize the overall risk to our marketable security investment portfolio.
310764_17_ITEM8_P22_S0	Our marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and trading securities.
310764_17_ITEM8_P22_S1	Investments in trading securities represent participant-directed investments of deferred employee compensation.
310764_17_ITEM8_P23_S0	Accounts receivable consists of trade and other miscellaneous receivables.
310764_17_ITEM8_P23_S1	An allowance is maintained for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable.
310764_17_ITEM8_P23_S2	Estimates are made regarding the ability of customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends.
310764_17_ITEM8_P23_S3	Accounts receivable are written off when all reasonable collection efforts are exhausted.
310764_17_ITEM8_P24_S0	Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost generally determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method.
310764_17_ITEM8_P25_S0	For excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell specific products at prices in excess of current carrying costs, reserves are maintained to reduce current carrying cost to market prices.
310764_17_ITEM8_P26_S0	Financial Instruments: Our financial instruments consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, other investments, accounts payable, debt and foreign currency exchange contracts.
310764_17_ITEM8_P26_S1	With the exception of our long-term debt, which is discussed in further detail in Notes 2 and 9, our estimates of fair value for financial instruments approximate their carrying amounts on December 31, 2016 and 2015 .
310764_17_ITEM8_P27_S0	All marketable securities are recognized at fair value.
310764_17_ITEM8_P27_S1	Adjustments to the fair value of marketable securities that are classified as available-for-sale are recorded as increases or decreases, net of income taxes, within accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) in shareholders equity and adjustments to the fair value of marketable securities that are classified as trading are recorded in earnings.
310764_17_ITEM8_P28_S0	The amortized cost of marketable debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity computed under the effective interest method.
310764_17_ITEM8_P28_S1	Such amortization and interest and realized gains and losses are included in other income (expense), net.
310764_17_ITEM8_P29_S0	The cost of securities sold is determined by the specific identification method.
310764_17_ITEM8_P30_S0	We review declines in the fair value of our investments classified as available-for-sale to determine whether the decline in fair value is an other-than-temporary impairment.
310764_17_ITEM8_P30_S1	The resulting losses from other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale marketable securities are included in earnings.
310764_17_ITEM8_P31_S0	Derivatives: All derivatives are recognized at fair value and reported on a gross basis.
310764_17_ITEM8_P32_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_17_ITEM8_P33_S0	transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting our risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates.
310764_17_ITEM8_P34_S0	The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies.
310764_17_ITEM8_P34_S1	All forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period.
310764_17_ITEM8_P35_S0	Forward currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are designed to hedge the variability of cash flows associated with forecasted transactions denominated in a foreign currency that will take place in the future.
310764_17_ITEM8_P35_S1	These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to forecasted intercompany purchases of manufactured products and generally have maturities up to eighteen months.
310764_17_ITEM8_P36_S0	Changes in value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until earnings are affected by the variability of the underlying cash flows.
310764_17_ITEM8_P36_S1	At that time, the applicable amount of gain or loss from the derivative instrument that is deferred in shareholders equity is reclassified into earnings and is included in other income (expense), net or cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, depending on the underlying transaction that is being hedged.
310764_17_ITEM8_P36_S2	Cash flows associated with these hedges are included in cash from operations in the same category as the cash flows from the items being hedged.
310764_17_ITEM8_P37_S0	Derivative forward contracts are used to offset our exposure to the change in value of specific foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, primarily intercompany payables and receivables.
310764_17_ITEM8_P37_S1	These derivatives are not designated as hedges and, therefore, changes in the value of these forward contracts are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related changes in value of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
310764_17_ITEM8_P38_S0	The estimated fair value of our forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points.
310764_17_ITEM8_P39_S0	We designated certain long-term intercompany loans payable and forward exchange contracts as net investment hedges of our investments in certain international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency.
310764_17_ITEM8_P40_S0	For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a net investment hedge, the effective portion of the derivative's gain or loss is recognized in OCI and reported as a component of AOCI.
310764_17_ITEM8_P41_S0	We use the forward method to measure ineffectiveness.
310764_17_ITEM8_P41_S1	Under this method the change in the carrying value of the Euro-denominated amounts due to remeasurement of the effective portion is reported as a component of AOCI.
310764_17_ITEM8_P41_S2	The remaining change in the carrying value of the ineffective portion, if any, is recognized in other income (expense), net.
310764_17_ITEM8_P41_S3	The gain or loss related to settled net investment hedges will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated.
310764_17_ITEM8_P42_S0	Forward starting interest rate derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are used to manage the exposure to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuance and refinancing of debt.
310764_17_ITEM8_P42_S1	The effective portion of the gain or loss on a forward starting interest rate derivative instrument that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge is reported as a component of AOCI.
310764_17_ITEM8_P42_S2	Beginning in the period in which the debt refinancing occurs and the related derivative instruments is terminated, the effective portion of the gains or losses is then reclassified into interest expense over the term of the related debt.
310764_17_ITEM8_P43_S0	Under these agreements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.
310764_17_ITEM8_P44_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost.
310764_17_ITEM8_P44_S1	Depreciation is generally computed by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of three to 30 years for buildings and improvements and three to 10 years for machinery and equipment.
310764_17_ITEM8_P45_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of tangible net assets of acquired businesses at the acquisition date, after amounts allocated to other identifiable intangible assets.
310764_17_ITEM8_P45_S1	Factors that contribute to the recognition of goodwill include synergies that are specific to our business and not available to other market participants and are expected to increase net sales and profits; acquisition of a talented workforce; cost savings opportunities; the strategic benefit of expanding our presence in core and adjacent markets; and diversifying our product portfolio.
310764_17_ITEM8_P46_S0	The fair values of other identifiable intangible assets are primarily determined using the income approach.
310764_17_ITEM8_P46_S1	Other intangible assets include, but are not limited to, developed technology, customer and distributor relationships (which reflect expected continued customer or distributor patronage) and trademarks and patents.
310764_17_ITEM8_P47_S0	Intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of four to 40 years.
310764_17_ITEM8_P47_S1	Certain acquired trade names are considered to have indefinite lives and are not amortized, but are assessed annually for potential impairment as described below.
310764_17_ITEM8_P48_S0	In certain of our acquisitions, we acquire in-process research and development (IPRD), which is an indefinite-lived intangible asset.
310764_17_ITEM8_P48_S1	IPRD where research has been completed becomes a determinable-lived intangible asset and IPRD determined to have no future use becomes impaired.
310764_17_ITEM8_P49_S0	Goodwill, Intangibles and Long-Lived Asset Impairment Tests: We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year.
310764_17_ITEM8_P49_S1	We consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill.
310764_17_ITEM8_P49_S2	In certain circumstances, we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability.
310764_17_ITEM8_P49_S3	Indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested at least annually for impairment by comparing the individual carrying values to the fair value.
310764_17_ITEM8_P49_S4	We review long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
310764_17_ITEM8_P49_S5	The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows.
310764_17_ITEM8_P49_S6	Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the asset's useful life based on updated projections.
310764_17_ITEM8_P49_S7	If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique.
310764_17_ITEM8_P50_S0	Assets classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
310764_17_ITEM8_P51_S0	Share-Based Compensation: We use share based compensation in the form of stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance-based restricted stock units (PSUs).
310764_17_ITEM8_P52_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_17_ITEM8_P53_S0	The options are granted for periods of up to 10 years and become exercisable in varying installments.
310764_17_ITEM8_P53_S1	We grant RSUs to key employees and non-employee directors and PSUs to certain key employees under our long-term incentive plans.
310764_17_ITEM8_P53_S2	The fair value of RSUs is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted closing price of our common stock on the date of grant, adjusted for the fact that RSUs do not include anticipated dividends.
310764_17_ITEM8_P53_S3	RSUs generally vest in one-third increments over a three -year period and are settled in stock.
310764_17_ITEM8_P53_S4	PSUs are earned over a three -year performance cycle and vest in March of the year following the end of that performance cycle.
310764_17_ITEM8_P53_S5	The number of PSUs that will ultimately be earned is based on our performance relative to pre-established goals in that three-year performance cycle.
310764_17_ITEM8_P53_S6	The fair value of PSUs is determined based on the quoted closing price of our common stock on the day of grant.
310764_17_ITEM8_P53_S7	Compensation expense is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the grant date.
310764_17_ITEM8_P53_S8	Compensation expense recognized reflects an estimate of the number of awards expected to vest after taking into consideration an estimate of award forfeitures based on actual experience and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the period required to obtain full vesting.
310764_17_ITEM8_P53_S9	Management expectations related to the achievement of performance goals associated with PSU grants is assessed regularly and that assessment is used to determine whether PSU grants are expected to vest.
310764_17_ITEM8_P53_S10	If performance-based milestones related to PSU grants are not met or not expected to be met, any compensation expense recognized associated with such grants will be reversed.
310764_17_ITEM8_P54_S0	Income Taxes: Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted income tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.
310764_17_ITEM8_P54_S1	Deferred income tax benefits generally represent the change in net deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the year.
310764_17_ITEM8_P54_S2	Other amounts result from adjustments related to acquisitions and foreign currency as appropriate.
310764_17_ITEM8_P55_S0	We operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both within the United States and internationally.
310764_17_ITEM8_P55_S1	Accordingly, management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations.
310764_17_ITEM8_P55_S2	Income tax authorities in these jurisdictions regularly perform audits of our income tax filings.
310764_17_ITEM8_P55_S3	Income tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing, product royalty and foreign branch arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates.
310764_17_ITEM8_P56_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In January 2017 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2017-01, Business Combinations: Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which revises the definition of a business under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805 by providing a more robust framework to use in determining when a set of acquired assets and activities constitutes a business.
310764_17_ITEM8_P56_S1	We plan to adopt this update on January 1, 2018.
310764_17_ITEM8_P56_S2	We are still evaluating the impact that this update will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_17_ITEM8_P57_S0	We adopted this update on January 1, 2017 and the adoption of this update will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_17_ITEM8_P58_S0	In March 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.
310764_17_ITEM8_P58_S1	This update simplifies the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as simplifying classification in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow.
310764_17_ITEM8_P58_S2	We adopted this update on January 1, 2017.
310764_17_ITEM8_P58_S3	If we adopted this update on January 1, 2016, the impact on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings would have been a tax benefit of $36 in 2016.
310764_17_ITEM8_P58_S4	The impact of adopting this update in 2017 on our Consolidated Financial Statements will depend on market factors, the timing and intrinsic value of future share-based compensation award vests and exercises.
310764_17_ITEM8_P59_S0	In February 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases.
310764_17_ITEM8_P59_S1	This update requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with lease terms greater than 12 months on the balance sheet.
310764_17_ITEM8_P59_S2	We plan to adopt this update on January 1, 2019.
310764_17_ITEM8_P59_S3	We are still evaluating the impact that this update will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_17_ITEM8_P60_S0	In May 2014 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
310764_17_ITEM8_P60_S1	This update outlines a single, comprehensive model for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers.
310764_17_ITEM8_P60_S2	We plan to adopt this update on January 1, 2018.
310764_17_ITEM8_P61_S0	The guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (modified retrospective method).
310764_17_ITEM8_P61_S1	We anticipate adopting the standard using the modified retrospective method.
310764_17_ITEM8_P61_S2	There may be differences in timing of revenue recognition under the new standard compared to recognition under ASC 605 - Revenue Recognition.
310764_17_ITEM8_P61_S3	No other new accounting pronouncements were issued or became effective in the period that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_17_ITEM8_P62_S0	NOTE 2 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1 Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
310764_17_ITEM8_P62_S1	Level 2 Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
310764_17_ITEM8_P62_S2	Level 3 Unobservable inputs reflecting our assumptions or external inputs from active markets.
310764_17_ITEM8_P63_S0	When applying the fair value principles in the valuation of assets and liabilities, we are required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
310764_17_ITEM8_P63_S1	We calculate the fair value of our Level 1 and Level 2 instruments based on the exchange traded price of identical or similar instruments, where available, or based on other observable inputs taking into account our credit risk and that of our counterparties.
310764_17_ITEM8_P63_S2	Foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate hedges are included in Level 2 as we use inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability.
310764_17_ITEM8_P64_S0	The Level 2 derivative instruments are primarily valued using standard calculations and models that use readily observable market data as their basis.
310764_17_ITEM8_P65_S0	Our Level 3 liabilities represent milestone payments for acquisitions.
310764_17_ITEM8_P65_S1	For certain Level 3 liabilities the Black-Scholes option pricing model was used to value the liabilities, while the fair value of other liabilities was estimated using a discounted cash flow technique.
310764_17_ITEM8_P66_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_17_ITEM8_P67_S0	related to the occurrence of certain triggering events, appropriately discounted considering the uncertainties associated with the obligation, which we estimate to be near 100% .
310764_17_ITEM8_P68_S0	We remeasure the fair value of our assets and liabilities each reporting period.
310764_17_ITEM8_P68_S1	We record the changes in fair value within selling, general and administrative expense and the changes in the time value of money within other income (expense), net.
310764_17_ITEM8_P69_S0	On December 31, 2016 the aggregate difference between the cost and fair value of available-for-sale marketable securities was nominal.
310764_17_ITEM8_P69_S1	Interest receivable was less than $1 and $2 in 2016 and 2015 related to our marketable security portfolio.
310764_17_ITEM8_P69_S2	The total of interest and marketable securities income was $29 , $14 , and $28 in 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 .
310764_17_ITEM8_P69_S3	The amounts were included in other income (expense), net.
310764_17_ITEM8_P69_S4	Less than 1% of our investments in available-for-sale marketable securities had a credit quality rating of less than A2 (Moody's), A (Standard Poor's) and A (Fitch).
310764_17_ITEM8_P69_S5	We do not plan to sell the investments, and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity.
310764_17_ITEM8_P69_S6	We do not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired on December 31, 2016 .
310764_17_ITEM8_P69_S7	On December 31, 2016 substantially all our investments with unrealized losses that were not deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired were in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months, and the losses were nominal.
310764_17_ITEM8_P70_S0	We use operational and economic hedges, foreign currency exchange forward contracts, net investment hedges (both long-term intercompany loans payable and forward exchange contracts) and interest rate derivative instruments to manage the impact of currency exchange and interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flow.
310764_17_ITEM8_P70_S1	We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes.
310764_17_ITEM8_P71_S0	On December 31, 2016 the total after-tax amount in AOCI related to our designated net investment hedges was $ 48 .
310764_17_ITEM8_P71_S1	We evaluate the effectiveness of our net investment hedges quarterly and did not recognize any ineffectiveness in 2016 .
310764_17_ITEM8_P71_S2	We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on our outstanding derivative instruments but do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our counterparties.
310764_17_ITEM8_P71_S3	Should a counterparty default, our maximum exposure to loss is the asset balance of the instrument.
310764_17_ITEM8_P72_S0	On December 31, 2016 pretax gains on derivatives designated as hedges that were recorded in AOCI are expected to be reclassified to earnings in the next 12 months were less than $1 compared with $ 17 on December 31, 2015.
310764_17_ITEM8_P72_S1	This reclassification is primarily due to the sale of inventory that includes previously hedged purchases.
310764_17_ITEM8_P72_S2	There were no ineffective portions of derivatives that resulted in gains or losses in any of the periods presented.
310764_17_ITEM8_P73_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_17_ITEM8_P74_S0	Interest Rate Hedges On December 31, 2016 we had interest rate swaps with notional amounts of $ 600 designated as forward starting interest rate swaps in anticipation of future debt issuances.
310764_17_ITEM8_P74_S1	The market value of outstanding interest rate swap agreements on December 31, 2016 was $ 48 , which was recorded in other long term assets with an offsetting amount recorded in AOCI.
310764_17_ITEM8_P74_S2	Upon the probable issuance of the debt, these amounts will be released to interest expense over the term of the debt.
310764_17_ITEM8_P74_S3	The cash flow effect of this hedge is recorded in cash flow from operations.
310764_17_ITEM8_P74_S4	In 2016 we terminated multiple designated interest rate cash flow hedges, recognized $7 in OCI related to hedges on our debt issuances and recognized a nominal amount of ineffectiveness in interest expense.
310764_17_ITEM8_P74_S5	The remaining amounts in AOCI will be reclassified to interest expense over the term of the debt.
310764_17_ITEM8_P75_S0	The cash flow effect of these hedges is recognized in cash flow from operations.
310764_17_ITEM8_P76_S0	On December 31, 2016 we had interest rate swaps with gross notional amounts of $500 designated as fair value hedges of underlying fixed rate obligations representing a portion of our $600 senior unsecured notes due in 2024.
310764_17_ITEM8_P76_S1	There was no hedge ineffectiveness recorded as a result of these fair value hedges.
310764_17_ITEM8_P77_S0	NOTE 5 - ACQUISITIONS In April 2016 we completed the acquisition of Sage Products, LLC (Sage) for total consideration of approximately $2,875 .
310764_17_ITEM8_P77_S1	Sage develops, manufactures and distributes intensive care disposable products.
310764_17_ITEM8_P77_S2	This acquisition enhanced our product offerings within our MedSurg segment.
310764_17_ITEM8_P77_S3	Purchase price allocations for this acquisition were based on preliminary valuations.
310764_17_ITEM8_P78_S0	Our estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period.
310764_17_ITEM8_P79_S0	In April 2016 we completed the acquisition of Physio-Control International, Inc. (Physio) for total net consideration of approximately $1,299 .
310764_17_ITEM8_P79_S1	Physio develops, manufactures and markets monitors/defibrillators, AEDs and CPR-assist devices along with data management and support services.
310764_17_ITEM8_P79_S2	This acquisition enhances our product offerings within our MedSurg segment.
310764_17_ITEM8_P79_S3	Purchase price allocations for this acquisition were based on preliminary valuations.
310764_17_ITEM8_P80_S0	Our estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period.
310764_17_ITEM8_P81_S0	The Other acquisitions in 2016 include the acquisition of the Synergetics neuro portfolio (Synergetics).
310764_17_ITEM8_P81_S1	The Synergetics acquisition enhances our product offerings within our MedSurg segment.
310764_17_ITEM8_P82_S0	Purchase price allocations for the Other acquisitions were based on preliminary valuations.
310764_17_ITEM8_P83_S0	Our estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period.
310764_17_ITEM8_P84_S0	The Other acquisitions in 2015 include the acquisition of certain assets of CHG Hospital Beds, Inc. (CHG).
310764_17_ITEM8_P84_S1	The CHG acquisition enhances our product offerings within our MedSurg segment.
310764_17_ITEM8_P85_S0	The measurement period for CHG is complete.
310764_17_ITEM8_P86_S0	Revisions to the original purchase price allocation were nominal.
310764_17_ITEM8_P86_S1	Goodwill acquired with the Sage, Synergetics and CHG acquisitions is deductible for tax purposes.
310764_17_ITEM8_P86_S2	Supplemental pro forma combined statements of earnings have not been presented for the Sage and Physio acquisitions as the impact of their results of operations were not material to the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
310764_17_ITEM8_P87_S0	NOTE 6 - CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS We are involved in various ongoing proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor, intellectual property and other matters that are more fully described below.
310764_17_ITEM8_P87_S1	The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time.
310764_17_ITEM8_P88_S0	In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages as well as other compensatory and equitable relief that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief.
310764_17_ITEM8_P88_S1	For legal matters for which management had sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management's best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, is recorded.
310764_17_ITEM8_P89_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_17_ITEM8_P90_S0	consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies.
310764_17_ITEM8_P91_S0	If actual outcomes are less favorable than those estimated by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.
310764_17_ITEM8_P92_S0	We are self-insured for product liability claims and expenses.
310764_17_ITEM8_P92_S1	The ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_17_ITEM8_P92_S2	In June 2012 we voluntarily recalled our Rejuvenate and ABG II Modular-Neck hip stems and terminated global distribution of these hip products.
310764_17_ITEM8_P92_S3	Product liability lawsuits relating to this voluntary recall have been filed against us.
310764_17_ITEM8_P93_S0	On November 3, 2014 we announced that we had entered into a settlement agreement to compensate eligible United States patients who had revision surgery to replace their Rejuvenate and/or ABG II Modular-Neck hip stem prior to that date and in December 2016 the settlement program was extended to patients who had revision surgery prior to December 19, 2016.
310764_17_ITEM8_P93_S1	We continue to offer support for recall-related care and reimburse patients who are not eligible to enroll in the settlement program for testing and treatment services, including any necessary revision surgeries.
310764_17_ITEM8_P93_S2	In addition, some lawsuits will remain and we will continue to defend against them.
310764_17_ITEM8_P93_S3	Based on the information that has been received, the actuarially determined range of probable loss to resolve this matter globally is currently estimated to be approximately $ 1,968 to $ 2,224 ($ 2,200 to $ 2,456 before $ 232 of third-party insurance recoveries).
310764_17_ITEM8_P93_S4	In 2016 we recorded additional charges to earnings of $ 144 , representing the excess of the minimum of the range over the previously recorded reserves.
310764_17_ITEM8_P93_S5	The final outcome of this matter is dependent on many factors that are difficult to predict including the number of enrollees in the settlement program and the total awards to them, the number and costs of patients not eligible for the settlement program who seek testing and treatment services and require revision surgery and the number and actual costs to resolve the remaining lawsuits.
310764_17_ITEM8_P93_S6	Accordingly, the ultimate cost to resolve this entire matter globally may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_17_ITEM8_P94_S0	In 2010 we filed a lawsuit in federal court against Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (Zimmer), alleging that a Zimmer product infringed on three of our patents.
310764_17_ITEM8_P94_S1	In 2013 following a jury trial favorable to us, the trial judge entered a final judgment that, among other things, awarded us damages of $ 76 and ordered Zimmer to pay us enhanced damages.
310764_17_ITEM8_P94_S2	In December 2014 the Federal Circuit affirmed the damages awarded to us, reversed the order for enhanced damages and remanded the issue of attorney fees to the trial court.
310764_17_ITEM8_P94_S3	In May 2015 the trial court entered a stipulated judgment that, among other things, required Zimmer to pay us the base amount of damages and interest, while the issues of enhanced damages and attorney fees continue to be pursued.
310764_17_ITEM8_P94_S4	In June 2015 we recorded a $ 54 gain, net of legal costs, which was recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses.
310764_17_ITEM8_P94_S5	On June 13, 2016 the United States Supreme Court vacated the decision of the Federal Circuit that reversed our judgment for enhanced damages and remanded the case to the Federal Circuit to reconsider the issue.

310764_17_ITEM8_P115_S2	The establishment of the European regional headquarters contributed to the lower effective income tax rates in 2015 and 2016.
310764_17_ITEM8_P116_S0	Interest and penalties included in other income (expense), net were ($ 1 ), ($ 4 ) and $ 8 in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .

310764_17_ITEM8_P118_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_17_ITEM8_P119_S0	Our income tax expense would have been reduced by $281 and $304 on December 31, 2016 and 2015 had these uncertain income tax positions been favorably resolved.
310764_17_ITEM8_P120_S0	It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change due to one or more of the following events in the next twelve months: expiring statutes, audit activity, tax payments, competent authority proceedings related to transfer pricing or final decisions in matters that are the subject of controversy in various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate, including inventory transfer pricing, cost sharing, product royalty and foreign branch arrangements.
310764_17_ITEM8_P120_S1	We are not able to reasonably estimate the amount or the future periods in which changes in unrecognized tax benefits may be resolved.

310764_17_ITEM8_P122_S0	In the normal course of business, income tax authorities in various income tax jurisdictions both within the United States and internationally conduct routine audits of our income tax returns filed in prior years.
310764_17_ITEM8_P122_S1	These audits are generally designed to determine if individual income tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretations of complex income tax regulations regarding the allocation of income to the various income tax jurisdictions.
310764_17_ITEM8_P123_S0	Income tax years are open from 2012 through the current year for the United States federal jurisdiction.

310764_17_ITEM8_P124_S0	NOTE 11 - RETIREMENT PLANS Defined Contribution Plans We provide certain employees with defined contribution plans and other types of retirement plans.
310764_17_ITEM8_P124_S1	A portion of our retirement plan expense under the defined contribution plans is funded with Stryker common stock.
310764_17_ITEM8_P124_S2	The use of Stryker common stock represents a non-cash operating activity that is not reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
310764_17_ITEM8_P125_S0	Defined Benefit Plans Certain of our subsidiaries have both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans covering some or all of their employees.
310764_17_ITEM8_P125_S1	Substantially all of the defined benefit pension plans have projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets.
310764_17_ITEM8_P125_S2	The discount rates were selected using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds on December 31 that would provide the necessary cash flows to match our projected benefit payments.
310764_17_ITEM8_P126_S0	Effective January 1, 2017, in countries where it was possible, we elected to change the method to calculate the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for our defined benefit plans and will measure these costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve of the projected cash flows for the respective plans.
310764_17_ITEM8_P126_S1	Our defined benefit plans previously utilized the yield curve approach to establish discount rates and we believe the new approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates.
310764_17_ITEM8_P126_S2	The change does not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations for those plans and is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate inseparable from a change in accounting principle, which is applied prospectively.
310764_17_ITEM8_P126_S3	The reductions in service and interest costs for 2017 associated with this change in estimate are nominal.
310764_17_ITEM8_P127_S0	The expected return on plan assets is determined by applying the target allocation in each asset category of plan investments to the anticipated return for each asset category based on historical and projected returns.
310764_17_ITEM8_P128_S0	The investment strategy for our defined benefit pension plans is to meet the liabilities of the plans as they fall due and to maximize the return on invested assets within appropriate risk tolerances.
310764_17_ITEM8_P129_S0	The estimated net actuarial loss for the defined benefit pension plans to be reclassified from AOCI into net periodic benefit cost is $8 in 2017.
310764_17_ITEM8_P130_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_17_ITEM8_P131_S0	pension plans will be reclassified from AOCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2017.
310764_17_ITEM8_P132_S0	Our Level 3 pension plan assets (Refer to Note 2 for an explanation of our fair value hierarchy) consist primarily of guaranteed investment contracts with insurance companies.
310764_17_ITEM8_P132_S1	The insurance contracts guarantee us principal repayment and a fixed rate of return.
310764_17_ITEM8_P133_S0	The $ 7 increase in Level 3 pension plan assets is primarily related to actual returns and acquired assets.
310764_17_ITEM8_P133_S1	We expect to contribute $20 to our defined benefit pension plans in 2017 .

310764_17_ITEM8_P139_S1	The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

310764_17_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Accordingly, management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Sage, Physio and other 2016 acquisitions, which are included in the December 31, 2016 consolidated financial statements of Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries.
310764_17_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Assets and shareholders' equity excluded from management's assessment constitute 2.2% and 0.5% of total assets and shareholders' equity, respectively, on December 31, 2016 and 6.6% and (0.1%) of net sales and net earnings, respectively.

310764_17_ITEM9A_P4_S1	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Stryker Corporation: We have audited Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).

310764_17_ITEM9A_P5_S3	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
310764_17_ITEM9A_P5_S4	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
310764_17_ITEM9A_P5_S5	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
310764_17_ITEM9A_P6_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
310764_17_ITEM9A_P6_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
310764_17_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
310764_17_ITEM9A_P6_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

310764_18_ITEM1_P0_S0	Stryker Corporation (Stryker or the Company) is one of the world's leading medical technology companies and, together with its customers, is driven to make healthcare better.
310764_18_ITEM1_P0_S1	The Company offers innovative products and services in Orthopaedics, Medical and Surgical, and Neurotechnology and Spine that help improve patient and hospital outcomes.
310764_18_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our core values guide our behaviors and actions and are fundamental to how we execute our mission.
310764_18_ITEM1_P2_S0	Stryker was incorporated in Michigan in 1946 as the successor company to a business founded in 1941 by Dr. Homer H. Stryker, a prominent orthopaedic surgeon and the inventor of several medical products.
310764_18_ITEM1_P2_S1	Our products are sold in over 85 countries through company-owned subsidiaries and branches, as well as third-party dealers and distributors, and include implants used in joint replacement and trauma surgeries; surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems; endoscopic and communications systems; patient handling, emergency medical equipment and intensive care disposable products; neurosurgical, neurovascular and spinal devices; as well as other products used in a variety of medical specialties.
310764_18_ITEM1_P3_S0	In the United States most of our products are marketed directly to doctors, hospitals and other healthcare facilities.
310764_18_ITEM1_P4_S0	As used herein, and except where the context otherwise requires, "Stryker," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Stryker Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
310764_18_ITEM1_P4_S1	We segregate our operations into three reportable business segments: Orthopaedics, MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Spine.
310764_18_ITEM1_P4_S2	Financial information regarding our reportable business segments and certain geographic information is included under "Results of Operations" in Item 7 of this report and Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_18_ITEM1_P5_S0	Orthopaedics Orthopaedics products consist primarily of implants used in hip and knee joint replacements and trauma and extremities surgeries.
310764_18_ITEM1_P6_S0	specialized instrumentation that make orthopaedic surgery and recovery simpler, faster and more effective.
310764_18_ITEM1_P6_S1	We support surgeons with the technology and services they need as they develop new surgical techniques.
310764_18_ITEM1_P6_S2	In 2015 we received clearance by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for our Mako total knee application and completed the full commercial launch in 2017.
310764_18_ITEM1_P6_S3	This expands our Mako product offerings of partial knee and total hip applications to provide a comprehensive solution in the robotic arm-assisted reconstructive surgery line.
310764_18_ITEM1_P7_S0	Stryker is one of four leading global competitors for joint replacement and trauma and extremities products; the other three being Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (Zimmer), DePuy Synthes (a Johnson Johnson company) and Smith Nephew plc (Smith Nephew).
310764_18_ITEM1_P8_S0	MedSurg MedSurg products include surgical equipment and navigation systems (Instruments), endoscopic and communications systems (Endoscopy), patient handling, emergency medical equipment and intensive care disposable products (Medical), reprocessed and remanufactured medical devices (Sustainability) and other medical device products used in a variety of medical specialties.
310764_18_ITEM1_P9_S0	Stryker is one of five leading global competitors in Instruments; the other four being Zimmer, Medtronic plc., Johnson Johnson and ConMed Linvatec, Inc. (a subsidiary of CONMED Corporation).
310764_18_ITEM1_P9_S1	In Endoscopy we compete with Smith Nephew, ConMed Linvatec, Arthrex, Inc., Karl Storz GmbH Co., Olympus Optical Co. Ltd. and STERIS plc.
310764_18_ITEM1_P9_S2	In Medical our primary competitors are Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc., Zoll Medical Corporation, Medline Industries and Koninklijke Philips N.V.
310764_18_ITEM1_P10_S0	In 2017 Instruments launched System 8, the next generation of power tools comprised of a sagittal saw, reciprocating saw, rotary drill and sternum saw.
310764_18_ITEM1_P10_S1	The new power tools offer improved ergonomics, a quick and efficient keyless chuck system preventing loosening through a secondary locking mechanism and advanced material and coating to prevent sticking and slipping.
310764_18_ITEM1_P10_S2	In addition, the handpieces are built to be actively washed and temporarily submerged prior to sterilization.
310764_18_ITEM1_P11_S0	Neurotechnology and Spine Neurotechnology and Spine products include neurosurgical, neurovascular, and spinal implant devices.
310764_18_ITEM1_P11_S1	Our neurotechnology offering includes products used for minimally invasive endovascular techniques; a comprehensive line of products for traditional brain and open skull based surgical procedures; orthobiologic and biosurgery products, including synthetic bone grafts and vertebral augmentation products; and minimally invasive products for the treatment of acute ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.
310764_18_ITEM1_P12_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_18_ITEM1_P13_S0	implant offering includes cervical, thoracolumbar and interbody systems used in spinal injury, deformity and degenerative therapies.
310764_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	Stryker is one of five leading global competitors in Neurotechnology; the other four being Medtronic, Johnson Johnson, Terumo Corporation and Penumbra, Inc.
310764_18_ITEM1_P14_S1	Stryker is one of five leading global competitors in Spine; the other four being Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc. (a subsidiary of Medtronic), DePuy Synthes, Nuvasive, Inc. and Globus Medical, Inc.
310764_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	In 2017 the New England Journal of Medicine published the results of the DAWN Trial, the first to provide compelling evidence in treating late window and wake-up stroke patients with mechanical thrombectomy.
310764_18_ITEM1_P15_S1	The purpose of the study is to demonstrate superior clinical outcomes at 90 days with Trevo Retriever plus medical management compared to medical management alone in appropriately selected stroke patients treated six to 24 hours after last seen well (for cases of unknown time of onset).
310764_18_ITEM1_P15_S2	The Trevo Retriever s indication within the DAWN Trial, for use in patients treated six to 24 hours after last seen well, is currently under an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE), and the submission for expanding the indication for the later time window is pending.
310764_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	Raw Materials and Inventory Raw materials essential to our business are generally readily available from multiple sources; however, certain of our raw materials are currently sourced from single suppliers.
310764_18_ITEM1_P16_S1	Substantially all products we manufacture are stocked in inventory, while certain MedSurg products are assembled to order.
310764_18_ITEM1_P17_S0	Patents and Trademarks Patents and trademarks are significant to our business to the extent that a product or an attribute of a product represents a unique design or process.
310764_18_ITEM1_P17_S1	Patent protection of such products restricts competitors from duplicating these unique designs and features.
310764_18_ITEM1_P17_S2	We seek to obtain patent protection on our products whenever appropriate for protecting our competitive advantage.
310764_18_ITEM1_P17_S3	On December 31, 2017 we owned approximately 2,674 United States patents and approximately 3,886 international patents.
310764_18_ITEM1_P18_S0	Seasonality Our business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is typically lower in the summer months, and sales of capital equipment are generally higher in the fourth quarter.
310764_18_ITEM1_P18_S1	In each of our product lines we compete with local and global companies.
310764_18_ITEM1_P18_S2	The development of new and innovative products is important to our success in all areas of our business.
310764_18_ITEM1_P18_S3	Competition in research involving the development and improvement of new and existing products and processes is particularly significant.
310764_18_ITEM1_P18_S4	The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and maintaining sales forces.
310764_18_ITEM1_P18_S5	We believe our commitment to innovation, quality and service and our reputation differentiates us in the highly competitive product categories in which we operate and enables us to compete effectively.
310764_18_ITEM1_P18_S6	We believe that our competitive position in the future will depend to a large degree on our ability to develop new products and make improvements to existing products.
310764_18_ITEM1_P19_S0	Research and Development Continued investment in research and development activities is critical to drive future growth and supports our strategy to make healthcare better through development of products and services that improve patient outcomes.
310764_18_ITEM1_P19_S1	Most of our products and product improvements were developed internally at research facilities in the United States, China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Puerto Rico, Sweden, Switzerland and United Kingdom.
310764_18_ITEM1_P19_S2	We also invest through acquisitions in technologies developed by third parties that have the potential to expand the markets in which we operate.
310764_18_ITEM1_P19_S3	We maintain close working relationships with physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist us in product development efforts.
310764_18_ITEM1_P19_S4	The total cost of research, development and engineering activities were $787 , $715 and $625 in 2017, 2016 and 2015.
310764_18_ITEM1_P20_S0	Our businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation.
310764_18_ITEM1_P21_S0	In the United States the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its subsequent amendments and the regulations issued and proposed thereunder provide for regulation by the FDA of the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices, including most of our products.
310764_18_ITEM1_P21_S1	Many of our new products fall into FDA classifications that require notification submitted as a 510(k) and review by the FDA before we begin marketing them.
310764_18_ITEM1_P21_S2	Certain of our products require extensive clinical testing, consisting of safety and efficacy studies, followed by pre-market approval (PMA) applications for specific surgical indications.
310764_18_ITEM1_P21_S3	The FDA's Quality System regulations set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the FDA.
310764_18_ITEM1_P21_S4	There are also certain requirements of state, local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the manufacture and marketing of our products.
310764_18_ITEM1_P22_S0	The member states of the European Union (EU) adopted the European Medical Device Directives, which form a single set of medical device regulations for all EU member countries.
310764_18_ITEM1_P22_S1	These regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member countries to meet certain quality system requirements and obtain CE marking for their products.
310764_18_ITEM1_P22_S2	We have authorization to apply the CE marking to substantially all of our products.
310764_18_ITEM1_P22_S3	In addition, we comply with the unique regulatory requirements of each of the countries in Europe and other countries in which we market our products.
310764_18_ITEM1_P22_S4	Initiatives to limit the growth of general healthcare expenses and hospital costs are ongoing in the markets in which we do business.
310764_18_ITEM1_P22_S5	These initiatives are sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector and include price regulation and competitive pricing.
310764_18_ITEM1_P22_S6	It is not possible to predict at this time the long-term impact of such cost containment measures on our future business.
310764_18_ITEM1_P23_S0	In addition, business practices in the healthcare industry are scrutinized, particularly in the United States, by federal and state government agencies.
310764_18_ITEM1_P23_S1	The resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.
310764_18_ITEM1_P24_S0	We are subject to various rules and regulation in the United States and internationally related to the protection of human health and the environment.
310764_18_ITEM1_P24_S1	Our operations involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes.
310764_18_ITEM1_P25_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_18_ITEM1_P26_S0	procedures are properly designed to comply, in all material respects, with applicable environmental laws and regulations.
310764_18_ITEM1_P26_S1	We do not expect compliance with these requirements to have a material effect on purchases of property, plant and equipment, cash flows, net earnings or competitive position.
310764_18_ITEM1_P27_S0	Employees On December 31, 2017 we had approximately 33,000 employees globally.
310764_18_ITEM1_P28_S0	Each of our executive officers was elected by our Board of Directors to serve in the office indicated until the first meeting of the Board of Directors following the annual meeting of shareholders in 2018 or until a successor is chosen and qualified or until his or her resignation or removal.
310764_18_ITEM1_P28_S1	Each of our executive officers held the position above or served Stryker in various executive or administrative capacities for at least five years, except for Ms. Fink and Mr. Sagar.
310764_18_ITEM1_P28_S2	Prior to joining Stryker in October 2013, Ms. Fink held a variety of senior level human resources roles for the previous six years at Johnson Johnson, most recently as the Worldwide Vice President, Human Resources of Ethicon.
310764_18_ITEM1_P28_S3	While at Stryker, Ms. Fink held two different senior level Human Resource roles.
310764_18_ITEM1_P28_S4	Prior to joining Stryker in May 2014, Mr. Sagar served as the Chief Information officer for Merck Millipore, and before that as Global Head of Information Systems and a member of the divisional board for the chemicals division of Merck KGaA.
310764_18_ITEM1_P28_S5	Mr. McLean was appointed to the position of President, Asia-Pacific, effective January 1, 2017.
310764_18_ITEM1_P28_S6	Prior to this role, Mr. McLean held a variety of senior level leadership roles at Stryker since 2005.
310764_18_ITEM1_P28_S7	Our main corporate website address is www.stryker.com.
310764_18_ITEM1_P29_S0	Copies of our filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are available free of charge on our website within the "Investors Relations" section as soon as reasonably practicable after having been electronically filed or furnished to the SEC.
310764_18_ITEM1_P29_S1	All SEC filings are also available at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov .
310764_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	This report contains statements that are not historical facts and are considered "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	are based on current projections about operations, industry conditions, financial condition and liquidity.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Words that identify forward-looking statements include words such as "may," "could," "will," "should," "possible," "plan," "predict," "forecast," "potential," "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "believe," "may impact," "on track," "goal," "strategy" and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance, an acquisition or our businesses.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P1_S2	In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Those statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Therefore, actual results could differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forward-looking statements include the risks discussed below.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties discussed below that could materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem not to be material may also materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P2_S2	LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS Current economic and political conditions make tax rules in jurisdictions subject to significant change: Our future results of operations could be affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was signed into law in the United States.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We are continuing to evaluate the impact of tax reform and expect our effective tax rate to increase.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	In addition, further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise, including as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
310764_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, has issued recommendations that, in some cases, would make substantial changes to numerous long-standing tax positions and principles.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P4_S3	These contemplated changes, to the extent adopted by OECD members and/or other countries, could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The impact of United States healthcare reform legislation on our business remains uncertain: In 2010 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	While the provisions of the ACA are intended to expand access to health insurance coverage and improve the quality of healthcare over time, other provisions of the legislation, including Medicare provisions aimed at decreasing costs, comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies, are having a meaningful effect on the way healthcare is developed and delivered and could have a significant effect on our business.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Among other things, the ACA imposed a 2.3 percent excise tax on medical devices that applies only to United States sales, which are a majority of our medical device sales.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Congress suspended the excise tax for 2016 and 2017.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P5_S4	The suspension was once again upheld in January 2018 for two years.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P5_S5	If the excise tax is not repealed or further suspended, the tax will adversely impact future results of operations after the current suspension expires in December 2019.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P5_S6	We also face uncertainties that might result from modification or repeal of any of the provisions of the ACA, including as a result of current and future executive orders and legislative actions.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the United States may have on our business.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We are subject to extensive governmental regulation relating to the manufacturing, labeling and marketing of our products: The manufacturing, labeling and marketing of our products are subject to extensive and evolving regulations and rigorous regulatory enforcement by the FDA, European Union and other governmental authorities in the United States and internationally.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted timely.

310764_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Regardless of outcome, such claims are expensive to defend and divert management and operating personnel from other business issues.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P11_S2	A successful claim or claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could result in payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments or negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products in the affected category.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Dependence on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to such rights may impact offerings in our product portfolios: Our long-term success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P11_S4	If we fail to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property protection, it could allow others to sell products that directly compete with proprietary features in our product portfolio.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Also, our issued patents may be subject to claims challenging their validity and scope and raising other issues.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P11_S6	In addition, currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents.

310764_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Cross border transactions with external parties and intercompany relationships result in increased exposure to foreign currency exchange effects.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	While we use derivative instruments to manage the impact of currency exchange; our hedging strategies may not be successful, and our unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P12_S3	In addition, the weakening or strengthening of the United States Dollar results in favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the results of our foreign locations are translated into United States Dollars.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Additional capital that we may require in the future may not be available to us or may only be available to us on unfavorable terms: Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including operating requirements, current and future acquisitions and the need to refinance existing debt.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Our ability to issue additional debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected by our debt levels, unfavorable changes in economic conditions or uncertainties that affect the capital markets.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating agencies could also adversely affect our access to and cost of financing.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P12_S7	Higher borrowing costs or the inability to access capital markets could adversely affect our ability to support future growth and operating requirements.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P12_S8	We are subject to cost containment measures in the United States and other countries resulting in pricing pressures: Initiatives to limit the growth of general healthcare expenses and hospital costs are ongoing in the markets in which we do business.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P12_S9	These initiatives are sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector and include price regulation and competitive pricing.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P12_S10	Pricing pressure has also increased due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers, trends toward managed care, the shift toward governments becoming the primary payers of healthcare expenses, reduction in reimbursement levels and medical procedure volumes and government laws and regulations relating to sales and promotion, reimbursement and pricing generally.

310764_18_ITEM1A_P14_S7	Our business could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks of international operations in an increasingly volatile environment.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P14_S8	We may be unable to capitalize on previous or future acquisitions:
310764_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	In addition to internally developed products, we invest in new products and technologies through acquisitions.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Such investments are inherently risky, and we cannot guarantee that any acquisition will be successful or will not have a material unfavorable impact on us.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P15_S2	The risks include the activities required and resources allocated to integrate new businesses, diversion of management time that could adversely affect management's ability to focus on other projects, the inability to realize the expected benefits, savings or synergies from the acquisition, the loss of key personnel and exposure to unexpected liabilities of acquired companies.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P15_S3	In addition, we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become or remain profitable.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P15_S4	We may incur goodwill impairment charges related to one or more of our business units: We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P15_S5	In evaluating the potential for impairment we make assumptions regarding revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows, tax rates and discount rates.

310764_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We could be negatively impacted by future changes in the allocation of income to each of the income tax jurisdictions in which we operate: We operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both in the United States and internationally.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Accordingly, our management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each jurisdiction based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Income tax authorities regularly perform audits of our income tax filings.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing, product royalty and foreign branch arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We could experience a failure of a key information technology system, process or site or a breach of information security, including a cybersecurity breach or failure of one or more key information technology systems, networks, processes, associated sites or service providers: We rely extensively on information technology (IT) systems to conduct business.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	In addition, we rely on networks and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third-parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats pose potential risks to the security of our IT systems, networks and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	While we have made investments seeking to address these threats, including monitoring of networks and systems, hiring of experts, employee training and security policies for employees and third-party providers, the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time and we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	If our IT systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly, or we or one of our third-party providers suffer a loss or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action.

310764_18_ITEM1A_P19_S6	Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of our new ERP system could adversely affect our ability to process orders, ship products, provide services and customer support, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P19_S7	We may be unable to attract and retain key employees: Our sales, technical and other key personnel play an integral role in the development, marketing and selling of new and existing products.

310764_18_ITEM1A_P22_S2	In the event of an interruption in manufacturing, we may be unable to move quickly to alternate means of producing affected products to meet customer demand.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P22_S3	In the event of a significant interruption, we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due to the need for regulatory approvals.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P22_S4	We may experience loss of market share, additional expense and harm to our reputation.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P22_S5	We use a variety of raw materials, components or devices in our global supply chains, production and distribution processes; significant shortages or price increases could increase our operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the competitive position of our products: Our reliance on certain suppliers to secure raw materials, components and finished devices exposes us to product shortages and unanticipated increases in prices.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P22_S6	In addition, several raw materials, components, and finished devices are procured from a sole-source due to the quality considerations, unique intellectual property considerations or constraints associated with regulatory requirements.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P22_S7	If sole-source suppliers are acquired or were unable or unwilling to deliver these materials, we may not be able to manufacture or have available one or more products during such period of unavailability and our business could suffer.
310764_18_ITEM1A_P22_S8	In certain cases we may not be able to establish additional or replacement suppliers for such materials in a timely or cost effective manner, largely as a result of FDA and other regulations that require, among other things, validation of materials and components prior to their use in our products.

310764_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	Research, Development and Engineering Expenses Research, development and engineering expenses represented 6.3% of net sales in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
310764_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	Projects to develop new products, investments in new technologies and recent acquisitions contributed to the spending levels, reflecting our continued commitment to innovation.
310764_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2017 increased to 36.6% from 36.5% in 2016 .
310764_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	Excluding the impact of certain items in the table below, expenses as a percentage of net sales were 34.8% in 2017 and 2016 .
310764_18_ITEM7_P9_S2	This reflects favorable leverage from higher sales volumes and continued focus on operating expense improvement initiatives, including leverage from our recent acquisitions, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange.
310764_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2016 increased to 36.5% from 36.3% in 2015 .
310764_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	Excluding the impact of certain items noted below, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased in 2016 due to favorable leverage from the continued focus on operating expense improvement initiatives, cost containment efforts and business mix, including leverage from our recent acquisitions.
310764_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	Recall Charges, Net of Insurance Proceeds Recall charges, net of insurance proceeds, were $173 , $158 and $296 in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
310764_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	Charges were primarily due to the previously disclosed Rejuvenate and ABGII Modular-Neck hip stems voluntary recalls.

310764_18_ITEM7_P11_S6	Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net was ($227) , ($245) and ($126) in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
310764_18_ITEM7_P11_S7	The decrease in 2017 was primarily driven by higher interest income and decreased foreign currency transaction losses, partially offset by higher interest expense due to higher debt levels as a result of our January 2017 debt offering.
310764_18_ITEM7_P11_S8	Refer to Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
310764_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	17.1% for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
310764_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	The effective income tax rate for 2017 includes the impact of complying with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 signed into law in December 2017, partially offset by the benefits from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 Compensation-Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting on January 1, 2017 and continued lower effective income tax rates as a result of the European regional headquarters.
310764_18_ITEM7_P12_S2	The establishment of the European regional headquarters contributed to the lower effective income tax rates in 2016 and 2015 .
310764_18_ITEM7_P12_S3	Net Earnings Net earnings in 2017 decreased to $1,020 or $2.68 per diluted share from $1,647 or $4.35 per diluted share in 2016 and $1,439 or $3.78 per diluted share in 2015 .
310764_18_ITEM7_P12_S4	The impact of foreign currency exchange rates reduced net earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.07 , $0.11 and $0.26 in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
310764_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	Non-GAAP Financial Measures We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including percentage sales growth in constant currency; percentage organic sales growth; adjusted gross profit; adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses; adjusted amortization of intangible assets; adjusted operating income; adjusted effective income tax rate; adjusted net earnings; and adjusted net earnings per diluted share (Diluted EPS).
310764_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance.
310764_18_ITEM7_P13_S2	Management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses.
310764_18_ITEM7_P13_S3	Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these non-GAAP financial measures.
310764_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales.
310764_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	Percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current and prior year results at the same foreign currency exchange rate.
310764_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	affect the comparability and trend of sales.
310764_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	Percentage organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates excluding the impact of acquisitions.
310764_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	To measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings.
310764_18_ITEM7_P17_S1	These adjustments are irregular in timing and may not be indicative of our past and future performance.
310764_18_ITEM7_P17_S2	The following are examples of the types of adjustments that may be included in a period: 1. Acquisition and integration-related costs .
310764_18_ITEM7_P17_S3	Costs related to integrating recently acquired businesses and specific costs (e.g., inventory step-up and deal costs) related to the consummation of the acquisition process.
310764_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	Amortization of purchased intangible assets .
310764_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	Periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets.
310764_18_ITEM7_P18_S2	Costs associated with the termination of sales relationships in certain countries, workforce reductions, elimination of product lines, weather-related asset impairments and associated costs and other restructuring-related activities.
310764_18_ITEM7_P18_S3	Rejuvenate and other recall matters .
310764_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	Our best estimate of the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve certain product recalls.
310764_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve certain regulatory matters and other legal settlements.
310764_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	Charges represent the impact of accounting for the compliance with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, certain significant and discrete tax items and adjustments to interest expense related to the settlement of certain tax matters.
310764_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names.
310764_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth, gross profit, cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, amortization of intangible assets, operating income, effective income tax rate, net earnings and net earnings per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
310764_18_ITEM7_P21_S2	These non-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures at the end of the discussion of Results of Operations below.
310764_18_ITEM7_P21_S3	We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.
310764_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	The weighted-average basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of non-GAAP earnings per share are the same as those used in the calculation of the reported per share amounts.
310764_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	We believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates.
310764_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures.
310764_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	Excess operating cash is used first to fund acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses.
310764_18_ITEM7_P25_S2	Other discretionary uses include dividends and share repurchases.
310764_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	We supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund our activities as necessary.
310764_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	Our overall cash position reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.
310764_18_ITEM7_P26_S2	Operating Activities Cash provided by operations was $1,559 , $1,915 , and $981 in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
310764_18_ITEM7_P26_S3	The decrease in cash from operations in 2017 was primarily due to higher Rejuvenate and ABG II recall-related payments compared to 2016 and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency remeasurement.
310764_18_ITEM7_P26_S4	The net of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable resulted in the consumption of $461 , $507 , and $231 of cash in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
310764_18_ITEM7_P26_S5	Investing Activities Cash (used in) provided by investing activities was ($1,613) , ($4,191) and $1,956 in 2017 , 2016 and in 2015 .
310764_18_ITEM7_P26_S6	Acquisitions, Net of Cash Acquired: Acquisitions resulted in cash consumption of $831 , $4,332 and $153 in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
310764_18_ITEM7_P26_S7	In 2017 we acquired NOVADAQ and certain other businesses and related assets.
310764_18_ITEM7_P26_S8	In 2016 the primary acquisitions were Sage and Physio.
310764_18_ITEM7_P26_S9	In 2015 the primary acquisition was CHG Hospital Beds, Inc.
310764_18_ITEM7_P26_S10	Purchases of Property, Plant and Equipment: Purchases of property, plant and equipment were $598 , $490 and $270 in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
310764_18_ITEM7_P26_S11	Capital expenditures in 2017 were primarily due to capital expenditures associated with the development of our global ERP system and investments in new and existing plants and equipment to support sales growth.
310764_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	Marketable Securities, Net: Net cash (used in) provided by the (purchase) sale of marketable securities was ($183) , $634 , and $2,379 in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
310764_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	Cash provided by the sale of marketable securities in 2016 was used to repay all of our senior unsecured notes that were due in September 2016 .
310764_18_ITEM7_P27_S2	Cash provided by sales of marketable securities in 2015 was primarily used to make recall-related payments.
310764_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	Financing Activities Dividends and Share Repurchases: Dividends paid per common share increased 11.8% to $1.70 per share in 2017 compared to $1.52 per share in 2016 , an increase of 10.1% from $1.38 in 2015 .
310764_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	Borrowings and Repayments of Debt: We maintain debt levels that we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors including cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and overall cost of capital.
310764_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	Net proceeds from borrowings were $299 , $2,912 and $48 in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
310764_18_ITEM7_P29_S2	In 2017 the proceeds were primarily from the issuance of $500 of senior unsecured notes in January 2017 partially offset by payment of $200 of commercial paper.
310764_18_ITEM7_P29_S3	In 2016 the proceeds were primarily from the issuance of $3,500 of senior unsecured notes in March 2016 partially offset by repayment of $750 of our senior unsecured notes due in September 2016.
310764_18_ITEM7_P29_S4	Refer to Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
310764_18_ITEM7_P29_S5	Liquidity Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $2,793 and $3,384 , and our current assets exceeded current liabilities by $4,508 and $4,713 on December 31, 2017 and 2016 .
310764_18_ITEM7_P29_S6	We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs, including acquisitions and recall-related payments, from a variety of sources, including cash from operations, commercial paper and existing credit lines.
310764_18_ITEM7_P29_S7	We have raised funds in the capital markets and may continue to do so from time to time.
310764_18_ITEM7_P29_S8	As a result of the issuance of senior unsecured notes in March 2016, Moody's downgraded our unsecured note ratings to Baa1 from A3, and Standard Poor's downgraded our corporate credit and long-term issue-level rating to A from A+ and our short-term rating to A-1 from A-1+.
310764_18_ITEM7_P29_S9	Nevertheless, we continue to have strong investment-grade short-term and long-term debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as needed.
310764_18_ITEM7_P29_S10	We have existing credit facilities should additional funds be required.
310764_18_ITEM7_P29_S11	We have a borrowing capacity available under our main credit facility of $1,500 .
310764_18_ITEM7_P29_S12	The amount of commercial paper we have issuable under the commercial paper program is $1,500 .
310764_18_ITEM7_P29_S13	Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held in locations outside the United States was approximately 62% and 84% on December 31, 2017 and 2016 .
310764_18_ITEM7_P29_S14	The majority of our cash held in locations outside the United States is considered to be indefinitely reinvested.
310764_18_ITEM7_P29_S15	We intend to use this cash to expand operations organically and through acquisitions.
310764_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	We do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.
310764_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND FORWARD-LOOKING CASH REQUIREMENTS As further described in Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2017 we recorded additional charges to earnings totaling $104 related to the Rejuvenate and ABG II recalls.
310764_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	Based on the information received, the actuarially determined range of probable loss to resolve this matter was estimated to be approximately $2,072 to $2,307 ( $2,304 to $2,539 before $232 of third-party insurance recoveries).
310764_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	The final outcome of this matter is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict.
310764_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	The ultimate cost to entirely resolve this matter may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	We are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which payments will be made.
310764_18_ITEM7_P34_S1	As further described in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, on December 31, 2017 we had a reserve for uncertain income tax positions of $540 .
310764_18_ITEM7_P34_S2	Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits, we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which any income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made.
310764_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	As further described in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, on December 31, 2017 our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by $338 , of which approximately $331 related to plans outside the United States.
310764_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	Due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and potential changes in legislation in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, we are not able to reasonably estimate the amounts that may be required to fund defined benefit pension plans.
310764_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES In preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, there are certain accounting policies, which may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application.
310764_18_ITEM7_P37_S1	We believe these accounting policies and the others set forth in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements are critical to understanding our results of operations and financial condition.
310764_18_ITEM7_P37_S2	Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.
310764_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	Inventory Reserves We maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs.
310764_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	We make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends.
310764_18_ITEM7_P38_S2	If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.
310764_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	Income Taxes Our annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes.
310764_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements.
310764_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense.
310764_18_ITEM7_P40_S2	These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.
310764_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement.
310764_18_ITEM7_P41_S1	Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment was deferred, the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction was taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment.
310764_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes.
310764_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	Realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods.
310764_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.
310764_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments.
310764_18_ITEM7_P44_S1	In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority.
310764_18_ITEM7_P44_S2	These differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment.
310764_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes.
310764_18_ITEM7_P45_S1	We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly.
310764_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions.
310764_18_ITEM7_P46_S1	Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
310764_18_ITEM7_P46_S2	Due to the number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events, such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans, could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate.
310764_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	Our financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition.
310764_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	In addition, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded on the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill.
310764_18_ITEM7_P48_S2	Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives.
310764_18_ITEM7_P48_S3	Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant items.
310764_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain.
310764_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets.
310764_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.
310764_18_ITEM7_P50_S2	Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.
310764_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment.
310764_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	With the exception of certain trade names, the majority of our acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer and distributor relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives.
310764_18_ITEM7_P51_S2	Our assessment as to the useful lives of these intangible assets is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, trademark, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarked or branded products are sold.
310764_18_ITEM7_P51_S3	Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors.
310764_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life.
310764_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	In some of our acquisitions, we acquire in-process research and development (IPRD) intangible assets.
310764_18_ITEM7_P53_S1	IPRD is considered to be an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the research is completed (then it becomes a determinable-lived intangible asset) or determined to have no future use (then it is impaired).
310764_18_ITEM7_P53_S2	The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment.
310764_18_ITEM7_P53_S3	Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles.
310764_18_ITEM7_P53_S4	We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year.
310764_18_ITEM7_P53_S5	We consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill.
310764_18_ITEM7_P53_S6	In certain circumstances, we also use a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability.
310764_18_ITEM7_P53_S7	In those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level.
310764_18_ITEM7_P53_S8	We test individual indefinite-lived intangibles by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value.
310764_18_ITEM7_P53_S9	We determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the income approach.
310764_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value.
310764_18_ITEM7_P54_S1	Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans.
310764_18_ITEM7_P54_S2	We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants.
310764_18_ITEM7_P54_S3	We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in the years presented, as our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill fair values exceeded their respective recorded values.
310764_18_ITEM7_P54_S4	Future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates and future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values.
310764_18_ITEM7_P54_S5	A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our results of operations.
310764_18_ITEM7_P54_S6	We review our other long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
310764_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level.
310764_18_ITEM7_P55_S1	The undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections.
310764_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique.
310764_18_ITEM7_P56_S1	Assets classified as held for sale, if any, are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
310764_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	Legal and Other Contingencies We are involved in various ongoing proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property, and other matters that are more fully described in Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_18_ITEM7_P57_S1	The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time.
310764_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory and equitable relief, that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief.
310764_18_ITEM7_P58_S1	For legal matters for which management had sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management's best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded.
310764_18_ITEM7_P58_S2	The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies.
310764_18_ITEM7_P58_S3	If actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.
310764_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	We are currently self-insured for product liability-related claims and expenses.
310764_18_ITEM7_P59_S1	The ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
310764_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We sell our products globally and, as a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak economic conditions or changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
310764_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the United States Dollar, European currencies, in particular the Euro, Swiss Franc and the British Pound, the Japanese Yen, the Australian Dollar and the Canadian Dollar.
310764_18_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We develop and manufacture products in the United States, Canada, China, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey and incur costs in the applicable local currencies.
310764_18_ITEM7A_P0_S3	This global deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on our cost of sales.
310764_18_ITEM7A_P0_S4	Refer to Notes 1, 3 and 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our use of derivative instruments to mitigate these risks.
310764_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies relative to the United States Dollar would change the December 31, 2017 fair value by approximately $349 .
310764_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income, shareholder s equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the "financial statements").
310764_18_ITEM8_P0_S1	In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
310764_18_ITEM8_P0_S2	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 8, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
310764_18_ITEM8_P1_S0	Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
310764_18_ITEM8_P1_S1	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits.
310764_18_ITEM8_P1_S2	We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
310764_18_ITEM8_P1_S3	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
310764_18_ITEM8_P1_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
310764_18_ITEM8_P1_S5	Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
310764_18_ITEM8_P1_S6	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
310764_18_ITEM8_P1_S7	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
310764_18_ITEM8_P1_S8	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
310764_18_ITEM8_P2_S0	Anti-dilutive shares excluded from the calculation of dilutive employee stock options were de minimis in all periods.

310764_18_ITEM8_P11_S0	NOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature of Operations: Stryker Corporation (the "Company," "we," "us," or "our") is one of the world's leading medical technology companies and, together with its customers, is driven to make healthcare better.
310764_18_ITEM8_P11_S1	The Company offers innovative products and services in Orthopaedics, Medical and Surgical, and Neurotechnology and Spine that improve patient and hospital outcomes.
310764_18_ITEM8_P11_S2	Our products include implants used in joint replacement and trauma surgeries; surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems; endoscopic and communications systems; patient handling, emergency medical equipment and intensive care disposable products; neurosurgical, neurovascular and spinal devices; as well as other products used in a variety of medical specialties.
310764_18_ITEM8_P12_S0	Basis of Presentation and Consolidation: The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its subsidiaries.
310764_18_ITEM8_P12_S1	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
310764_18_ITEM8_P12_S2	We have no material interests in variable interest entities and none that require consolidation.
310764_18_ITEM8_P12_S3	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the presentation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in 2017 .
310764_18_ITEM8_P13_S0	Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses in the reporting period.
310764_18_ITEM8_P13_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
310764_18_ITEM8_P14_S0	Sales are recognized when revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned.
310764_18_ITEM8_P14_S1	Our policy is to recognize revenue when title to the product, ownership and risk of loss transfer to the customer, which can be on the date of shipment, the date of receipt by the customer or, for most Orthopaedics products, when we receive appropriate notification that the product has been used or implanted.
310764_18_ITEM8_P14_S2	A provision for estimated sales returns, discounts, rebates and other sales incentives is recorded as a reduction of net sales in the same period that the revenue is recognized.
310764_18_ITEM8_P14_S3	Shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in net sales.
310764_18_ITEM8_P15_S0	Cost of Sales: Cost of sales is primarily comprised of direct materials and supplies consumed in the manufacture of product, as well as manufacturing labor, depreciation expense and direct overhead expense necessary to acquire and convert the purchased materials and supplies into finished product.
310764_18_ITEM8_P15_S1	Cost of sales also includes the cost to distribute products to customers, inbound freight costs, warehousing costs and other shipping and handling activity.
310764_18_ITEM8_P16_S0	Research, Development and Engineering Expenses: Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred.
310764_18_ITEM8_P16_S1	Costs include research, development and engineering activities relating to the development of new products, improvement of existing products, technical support of products and compliance with governmental regulations for the protection of customers and patients.
310764_18_ITEM8_P16_S2	Costs primarily consist of salaries, wages, consulting and depreciation and maintenance of research facilities and equipment.
310764_18_ITEM8_P16_S3	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: Selling, general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of selling expenses, marketing expenses, administrative and other indirect overhead costs, amortization of loaner instrumentation, depreciation and amortization expense of non-manufacturing assets and other miscellaneous operating items.
310764_18_ITEM8_P17_S0	Currency Translation: Financial statements of subsidiaries outside the United States generally are measured using the local currency as the functional currency.
310764_18_ITEM8_P17_S1	Adjustments to translate those statements into United States Dollars are recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI).
310764_18_ITEM8_P18_S0	Transactional exchange gains and losses are included in earnings.
310764_18_ITEM8_P19_S0	Cash Equivalents: Highly liquid investments with remaining stated maturities of three months or less when purchased are considered cash equivalents and recorded at cost.
310764_18_ITEM8_P20_S0	Marketable Securities: Marketable securities consist of marketable debt securities, certificates of deposit and mutual funds.
310764_18_ITEM8_P20_S1	Mutual funds are acquired to offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements and are expected to be used to settle these liabilities.
310764_18_ITEM8_P21_S0	Pursuant to our investment policy, all individual marketable security investments must have a minimum credit quality of single A (Standard Poor s and Fitch) and A2 (Moody s Corporation) at the time of acquisition, while the overall portfolio of marketable securities must maintain a minimum average credit quality of double A (Standard Poor s and Fitch) or Aa (Moody s Corporation).
310764_18_ITEM8_P21_S1	In the event of a rating downgrade below the minimum credit quality subsequent to purchase, the marketable security investment is evaluated to determine the appropriate action to take to minimize the overall risk to our marketable security investment portfolio.
310764_18_ITEM8_P22_S0	Our marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and trading securities.
310764_18_ITEM8_P22_S1	Investments in trading securities represent participant-directed investments of deferred employee compensation.
310764_18_ITEM8_P23_S0	Accounts receivable consists of trade and other miscellaneous receivables.
310764_18_ITEM8_P23_S1	An allowance is maintained for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable.
310764_18_ITEM8_P23_S2	Estimates are made regarding the ability of customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends.
310764_18_ITEM8_P23_S3	Accounts receivable are written off when all reasonable collection efforts are exhausted.
310764_18_ITEM8_P24_S0	Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost generally determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method.
310764_18_ITEM8_P25_S0	For excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell specific products at prices in excess of current carrying costs, reserves are maintained to reduce current carrying cost to market prices.
310764_18_ITEM8_P26_S0	Financial Instruments: Our financial instruments consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, other investments, accounts payable, debt and foreign currency exchange contracts.
310764_18_ITEM8_P26_S1	The carrying value of our financial instruments, with the exception of our senior unsecured notes, approximates fair value on December 31, 2017 and 2016 .
310764_18_ITEM8_P26_S2	Refer to Note 2 and 9 for further details.
310764_18_ITEM8_P27_S0	All marketable securities are recognized at fair value.
310764_18_ITEM8_P27_S1	Adjustments to the fair value of marketable securities that are classified as available-for-sale are recorded as increases or decreases, net of income taxes, within accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) in shareholders equity and adjustments to the fair value of marketable securities that are classified as trading are recorded in earnings.
310764_18_ITEM8_P28_S0	The amortized cost of marketable debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity computed under the effective interest method.
310764_18_ITEM8_P28_S1	Such amortization and interest and realized gains and losses are included in other income (expense), net.
310764_18_ITEM8_P29_S0	The cost of securities sold is determined by the specific identification method.
310764_18_ITEM8_P30_S0	We review declines in the fair value of our investments classified as available-for-sale to determine whether the decline in fair value is an other-than-temporary impairment.
310764_18_ITEM8_P31_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_18_ITEM8_P32_S0	other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale marketable securities are included in earnings.
310764_18_ITEM8_P33_S0	Derivatives: All derivatives are recognized at fair value and reported on a gross basis.
310764_18_ITEM8_P34_S0	We enter into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting our risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates.
310764_18_ITEM8_P34_S1	The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies.
310764_18_ITEM8_P34_S2	All forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period.
310764_18_ITEM8_P35_S0	Forward currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are designed to hedge the variability of cash flows associated with forecasted transactions denominated in a foreign currency that will take place in the future.
310764_18_ITEM8_P35_S1	These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to forecasted intercompany purchases of manufactured products and generally have maturities up to eighteen months.
310764_18_ITEM8_P36_S0	Changes in value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until earnings are affected by the variability of the underlying cash flows.
310764_18_ITEM8_P36_S1	At that time, the applicable amount of gain or loss from the derivative instrument that is deferred in shareholders equity is reclassified into earnings and is included in other income (expense), net or cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, depending on the underlying transaction that is being hedged.
310764_18_ITEM8_P36_S2	Cash flows associated with these hedges are included in cash from operations in the same category as the cash flows from the items being hedged.
310764_18_ITEM8_P37_S0	Derivative forward contracts are used to offset our exposure to the change in value of specific foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, primarily intercompany payables and receivables.
310764_18_ITEM8_P37_S1	These derivatives are not designated as hedges and, therefore, changes in the value of these forward contracts are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related changes in value of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
310764_18_ITEM8_P38_S0	The estimated fair value of our forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points.
310764_18_ITEM8_P39_S0	We designated certain long-term intercompany loans payable and forward exchange contracts as net investment hedges of our investments in certain international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency.
310764_18_ITEM8_P40_S0	For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a net investment hedge, the effective portion of the derivative's gain or loss is recognized in OCI and reported as a component of AOCI.
310764_18_ITEM8_P41_S0	We use the forward method to measure ineffectiveness.
310764_18_ITEM8_P41_S1	Under this method the change in the carrying value of the Euro-denominated amounts due to remeasurement of the effective portion is reported as a component of AOCI.
310764_18_ITEM8_P41_S2	The remaining change in the carrying value of the ineffective portion, if any, is recognized in other income (expense), net.
310764_18_ITEM8_P41_S3	The gain or loss related to settled net investment hedges will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated.
310764_18_ITEM8_P42_S0	Forward starting interest rate derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are used to manage the exposure to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuance and refinancing of debt.
310764_18_ITEM8_P42_S1	The effective portion of the gain or loss on a forward starting interest rate derivative instrument that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge is reported as a component of AOCI.
310764_18_ITEM8_P43_S0	gains or losses is then reclassified into interest expense over the term of the related debt.
310764_18_ITEM8_P43_S1	Interest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges are being used to manage the exposure to interest rate movements and to reduce borrowing costs by converting fixed-rate debt into floating-rate debt.
310764_18_ITEM8_P43_S2	Under these agreements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.
310764_18_ITEM8_P44_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost.
310764_18_ITEM8_P44_S1	Depreciation is generally computed by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of three to 30 years for buildings and improvements and three to 10 years for machinery and equipment.
310764_18_ITEM8_P45_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of tangible net assets of acquired businesses at the acquisition date, after amounts allocated to other identifiable intangible assets.
310764_18_ITEM8_P45_S1	Factors that contribute to the recognition of goodwill include synergies that are specific to our business and not available to other market participants and are expected to increase net sales and profits; acquisition of a talented workforce; cost savings opportunities; the strategic benefit of expanding our presence in core and adjacent markets; and diversifying our product portfolio.
310764_18_ITEM8_P46_S0	The fair values of other identifiable intangible assets are primarily determined using the income approach.
310764_18_ITEM8_P46_S1	Other intangible assets include, but are not limited to, developed technology, customer and distributor relationships (which reflect expected continued customer or distributor patronage) and trademarks and patents.
310764_18_ITEM8_P47_S0	Intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of four to 40 years.
310764_18_ITEM8_P47_S1	Certain acquired trade names are considered to have indefinite lives and are not amortized, but are assessed annually for potential impairment as described below.
310764_18_ITEM8_P48_S0	In some of our acquisitions, we acquire in-process research and development (IPRD), which is an indefinite-lived intangible asset.
310764_18_ITEM8_P48_S1	IPRD where research has been completed becomes a determinable-lived intangible asset and IPRD determined to have no future use becomes impaired.
310764_18_ITEM8_P49_S0	Goodwill, Intangibles and Long-Lived Asset Impairment Tests: We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year.
310764_18_ITEM8_P49_S1	We consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill.
310764_18_ITEM8_P49_S2	In certain circumstances, we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability.
310764_18_ITEM8_P49_S3	Indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested at least annually for impairment by comparing the individual carrying values to the fair value.
310764_18_ITEM8_P49_S4	We review long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
310764_18_ITEM8_P49_S5	The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows.
310764_18_ITEM8_P49_S6	Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the asset's useful life based on updated projections.
310764_18_ITEM8_P49_S7	If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique.
310764_18_ITEM8_P50_S0	Assets classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
310764_18_ITEM8_P51_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_18_ITEM8_P52_S0	Share-Based Compensation: We use share based compensation in the form of stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance-based restricted stock units (PSUs).
310764_18_ITEM8_P53_S0	Stock options are granted under long-term incentive plans to certain key employees and non-employee directors at an exercise price not less than the fair market value of the underlying common stock, which is the quoted closing price of our common stock on the day prior to the date of grant.
310764_18_ITEM8_P53_S1	The options are granted for periods of up to 10 years and become exercisable in varying installments.
310764_18_ITEM8_P53_S2	We grant RSUs to key employees and non-employee directors and PSUs to certain key employees under our long-term incentive plans.
310764_18_ITEM8_P53_S3	The fair value of RSUs is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted closing price of our common stock on the date of grant, adjusted for the fact that RSUs do not include anticipated dividends.
310764_18_ITEM8_P53_S4	RSUs generally vest in one-third increments over a three -year period and are settled in stock.
310764_18_ITEM8_P53_S5	PSUs are earned over a three -year performance cycle and vest in March of the year following the end of that performance cycle.
310764_18_ITEM8_P53_S6	The number of PSUs that will ultimately be earned is based on our performance relative to pre-established goals in that three -year performance cycle.
310764_18_ITEM8_P53_S7	The fair value of PSUs is determined based on the quoted closing price of our common stock on the day of grant.
310764_18_ITEM8_P53_S8	Compensation expense is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the grant date.
310764_18_ITEM8_P53_S9	Compensation expense recognized reflects an estimate of the number of awards expected to vest after taking into consideration an estimate of award forfeitures based on actual experience and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the period required to obtain full vesting.
310764_18_ITEM8_P53_S10	Management expectations related to the achievement of performance goals associated with PSU grants is assessed regularly and that assessment is used to determine whether PSU grants are expected to vest.
310764_18_ITEM8_P53_S11	If performance-based milestones related to PSU grants are not met or not expected to be met, any compensation expense recognized associated with such grants will be reversed.
310764_18_ITEM8_P54_S0	Income Taxes: Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted income tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.
310764_18_ITEM8_P54_S1	Deferred income tax benefits generally represent the change in net deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the year.
310764_18_ITEM8_P54_S2	Other amounts result from adjustments related to acquisitions and foreign currency as appropriate.
310764_18_ITEM8_P55_S0	We operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both within the United States and internationally.
310764_18_ITEM8_P55_S1	Accordingly, management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations.
310764_18_ITEM8_P55_S2	Income tax authorities in these jurisdictions regularly perform audits of our income tax filings.
310764_18_ITEM8_P55_S3	Income tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing, product royalty and foreign branch arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates.
310764_18_ITEM8_P56_S0	The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 including interim periods within those fiscal years.
310764_18_ITEM8_P56_S1	We have performed a preliminary assessment of the impact from this update and do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_18_ITEM8_P56_S2	We are currently evaluating our timing of adopting this standard.
310764_18_ITEM8_P56_S3	In May 2017 the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation, which revises the guidance related to changes in terms or conditions of a share-based payment award.
310764_18_ITEM8_P56_S4	We plan to adopt this update on January 1, 2018 and do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_18_ITEM8_P57_S0	In March 2017 the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits, which revises the recognition and presentation of the elements of net pension benefit costs.
310764_18_ITEM8_P57_S1	We plan to adopt this update on January 1, 2018 and do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_18_ITEM8_P58_S0	In February 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases.
310764_18_ITEM8_P58_S1	This update requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with terms greater than 12 months.
310764_18_ITEM8_P58_S2	We are in the process of evaluating the impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and anticipate most of our current operating leases, as well as some service contracts, will result in the recognition of right to use assets and corresponding lease liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
310764_18_ITEM8_P58_S3	We also anticipate changes in classification between financial statement line items in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, but do not anticipate adoption of the update will have a material impact on net earnings and cash flows.
310764_18_ITEM8_P58_S4	We plan to adopt this update on January 1, 2019.
310764_18_ITEM8_P59_S0	In October 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes, Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which requires companies to account for the income tax effect of intercompany sales and transfers of assets other than inventory when the transfer occurs.
310764_18_ITEM8_P59_S1	Under current guidance, we defer the income tax effects of intercompany transfers of assets until the asset has been sold to an outside party or otherwise recognized.
310764_18_ITEM8_P59_S2	We will adopt this update on January 1, 2018.
310764_18_ITEM8_P59_S3	We have finalized our assessment of the impact from this update and have recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to decrease retained earnings in the amount of approximately $696 as of January 1, 2018.
310764_18_ITEM8_P60_S0	In May 2014 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
310764_18_ITEM8_P60_S1	This update outlines a single, comprehensive model for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers.
310764_18_ITEM8_P60_S2	The guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (modified retrospective method).
310764_18_ITEM8_P60_S3	We plan to adopt this update on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach by recognizing the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for 2018.
310764_18_ITEM8_P60_S4	We have finalized our assessment of the impact from this update and have recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to decrease retained earnings in the amount of $55 as of January 1, 2018.
310764_18_ITEM8_P60_S5	We expect the impact from adoption of this standard will be recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings in 2018.
310764_18_ITEM8_P60_S6	Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted On January 1, 2017 we adopted ASU 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.

310764_18_ITEM8_P62_S2	The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_18_ITEM8_P62_S3	No other new accounting pronouncements were issued or became effective in the period that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
310764_18_ITEM8_P63_S0	NOTE 2 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
310764_18_ITEM8_P64_S0	Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1 Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
310764_18_ITEM8_P64_S1	Level 2 Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
310764_18_ITEM8_P64_S2	Level 3 Unobservable inputs reflecting our assumptions or external inputs from active markets.
310764_18_ITEM8_P65_S0	Use of observable market data, when available, is required in making fair value measurements.
310764_18_ITEM8_P66_S0	When inputs used fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
310764_18_ITEM8_P67_S0	We determine fair value for Level 1 instruments using exchange-traded prices for identical instruments.
310764_18_ITEM8_P67_S1	We determine fair value of Level 2 instruments using exchange-traded prices of similar instruments, where available, or utilizing other observable inputs that take into account our credit risk and that of our counterparties.
310764_18_ITEM8_P67_S2	Foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate hedges are included in Level 2 and we use inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability.
310764_18_ITEM8_P68_S0	The Level 2 derivative instruments are primarily valued using standard calculations and models that use readily observable market data as their basis.
310764_18_ITEM8_P69_S0	Our Level 3 liabilities are comprised of contingent consideration arising from recently completed acquisitions.
310764_18_ITEM8_P69_S1	We determine fair value of these Level 3 liabilities using a discounted cash flow technique or the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
310764_18_ITEM8_P69_S2	Significant unobservable inputs were used in our assessment of fair value, including assumptions regarding future business results, discount rates, discount periods and probability assessments based on likelihood of reaching various targets.
310764_18_ITEM8_P70_S0	We remeasure the fair value of our assets and liabilities each reporting period.
310764_18_ITEM8_P70_S1	We record the changes in fair value within selling, general and administrative expense and the changes in the time value of money within other income (expense), net.
310764_18_ITEM8_P71_S0	On December 31, 2017 the aggregate difference between the cost and fair value of available-for-sale marketable securities was nominal.

310764_18_ITEM8_P71_S4	We do not plan to sell the investments, and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity.
310764_18_ITEM8_P71_S5	We do not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired on December 31, 2017 .
310764_18_ITEM8_P71_S6	On December 31, 2017 substantially all our investments with unrealized losses that were not deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired were in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months, and the losses were nominal.

310764_18_ITEM8_P74_S1	We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on our outstanding derivative instruments but do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our counterparties.
310764_18_ITEM8_P74_S2	Should a counterparty default, our maximum exposure to loss is the asset balance of the instrument.
310764_18_ITEM8_P75_S0	On December 31, 2017 the total after-tax amount in AOCI related to our designated net investment hedges was $30 .
310764_18_ITEM8_P76_S0	We evaluate the effectiveness of our net investment hedges quarterly.
310764_18_ITEM8_P76_S1	We have not recognized any ineffectiveness in 2017 .
310764_18_ITEM8_P77_S0	On December 31, 2017 pretax gains recorded in AOCI on derivatives designated as hedges that are expected to be reclassified to earnings within 12 months of the balance sheet date were $7 compared with less than $1 on December 31, 2016 .
310764_18_ITEM8_P77_S1	This reclassification is primarily due to the sale of inventory that includes previously hedged purchases.
310764_18_ITEM8_P77_S2	There were de minimis ineffective portions of derivatives, which are included in the table above.
310764_18_ITEM8_P78_S0	Interest Rate Hedges On December 31, 2017 we had interest rate swaps with notional amounts of $600 designated as forward starting interest rate swaps in anticipation of future debt issuances.

310764_18_ITEM8_P78_S3	The cash flow effect of this hedge is recorded in cash flow from operations.
310764_18_ITEM8_P79_S0	On December 31, 2017 we had interest rate swaps with gross notional amounts of $500 designated as fair value hedges of underlying fixed rate obligations representing a portion of our $600 senior unsecured notes due in 2024.
310764_18_ITEM8_P79_S1	There was no hedge ineffectiveness recorded as a result of these fair value hedges in 2017 .
310764_18_ITEM8_P80_S0	NOTE 5 - ACQUISITIONS In 2017 and 2016 total cash paid for acquisitions was $831 and $4,332 .

310764_18_ITEM8_P81_S1	In December 2017 we announced a definitive merger agreement to acquire Entellus Medical, Inc. (Entellus), a high-growth global medical technology company focused on delivering superior patient and physician experiences through products designed for the minimally invasive treatment of various ear, nose and throat (ENT) disease states, for $24.00 per share, or total consideration of approximately $662 .
310764_18_ITEM8_P81_S2	Entellus, which had net sales of approximately $75 in 2016, will be integrated into the Instruments business within MedSurg.

310764_18_ITEM8_P81_S4	In September 2017 we completed the acquisition of NOVADAQ Technologies Inc. (NOVADAQ) for total consideration of approximately $716 .
310764_18_ITEM8_P81_S5	NOVADAQ is a leading developer of fluorescence imaging technology that provides surgeons with visualization of blood flow in vessels and related tissue perfusion in cardiac, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, plastic, microsurgical, and reconstructive procedures.
310764_18_ITEM8_P81_S6	This acquisition enhances product offerings within our MedSurg segment.
310764_18_ITEM8_P81_S7	Goodwill related to the NOVADAQ acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes.
310764_18_ITEM8_P82_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_18_ITEM8_P83_S0	Purchase price allocations for NOVADAQ and other acquisitions in 2017 and 2016 were based on preliminary valuations.
310764_18_ITEM8_P84_S0	Our estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period.
310764_18_ITEM8_P85_S0	The purchase price allocation for the acquisitions of Sage Products, LLC (Sage) and Physio-Control International, Inc. (Physio) was finalized in 2017.
310764_18_ITEM8_P85_S1	Goodwill related to the Sage acquisition is deductible for tax purposes.
310764_18_ITEM8_P86_S0	NOTE 6 - CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS We are involved in various ongoing proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor, intellectual property and other matters that are more fully described below.
310764_18_ITEM8_P86_S1	The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time.
310764_18_ITEM8_P87_S0	In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages as well as other compensatory and equitable relief that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief.
310764_18_ITEM8_P87_S1	For legal matters for which management had sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management's best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, is recorded.
310764_18_ITEM8_P87_S2	The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies.
310764_18_ITEM8_P87_S3	If actual outcomes are less favorable than those estimated by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.
310764_18_ITEM8_P88_S0	We are self-insured for product liability claims and expenses.
310764_18_ITEM8_P88_S1	The ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_18_ITEM8_P88_S2	In June 2012 we voluntarily recalled our Rejuvenate and ABG II Modular-Neck hip stems and terminated global distribution of these hip products.
310764_18_ITEM8_P88_S3	Product liability lawsuits relating to this voluntary recall have been filed against us.
310764_18_ITEM8_P89_S0	On November 3, 2014 we announced that we had entered into a settlement agreement to compensate eligible United States patients who had revision surgery to replace their Rejuvenate and/or ABG II Modular-Neck hip stem prior to that date and in December 2016 the settlement program was extended to patients who had revision surgery prior to December 19, 2016.
310764_18_ITEM8_P89_S1	We continue to offer support for recall-related care and reimburse patients who are not eligible to enroll in the settlement program for testing and treatment services, including any necessary revision surgeries.
310764_18_ITEM8_P90_S0	Based on the information that has been received, the actuarially determined range of probable loss to resolve this matter globally is currently estimated to be approximately $2,072 to $2,307 ( $2,304 to $2,539 before $232 of third-party insurance recoveries).
310764_18_ITEM8_P90_S1	We recorded additional charges to earnings of $104 in 2017 , representing the excess of the minimum of the range over the previously recorded reserves.
310764_18_ITEM8_P90_S2	The final outcome of this matter is dependent on many factors that are difficult to predict including the number of enrollees in the settlement program and the total awards to them, the number and costs of patients not eligible for the settlement program who seek testing and treatment services and require revision surgery and the number and actual costs to resolve the remaining lawsuits.
310764_18_ITEM8_P90_S3	Accordingly, the ultimate cost to resolve this entire matter globally may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
310764_18_ITEM8_P91_S0	In 2010 we filed a lawsuit in federal court against Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (Zimmer), alleging that a Zimmer product infringed on three of our patents.
310764_18_ITEM8_P91_S1	In 2013 following a jury trial favorable to us, the trial judge entered a final judgment that, among other things, awarded us damages of $76 and ordered Zimmer to pay us enhanced damages.
310764_18_ITEM8_P91_S2	In December 2014 the Federal Circuit affirmed the damages awarded to us, reversed the order for enhanced damages and remanded the issue of attorney fees to the trial court.
310764_18_ITEM8_P91_S3	In May 2015 the trial court entered a stipulated judgment that, among other things, required Zimmer to pay us the base amount of damages and interest, while the issues of enhanced damages and attorney fees continue to be pursued.
310764_18_ITEM8_P91_S4	In June 2015 we recorded a $54 gain, net of legal costs, which was recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses.
310764_18_ITEM8_P91_S5	On June 13, 2016 the United States Supreme Court vacated the decision of the Federal Circuit that reversed our judgment for enhanced damages and remanded the case to the Federal Circuit to reconsider the issue.
310764_18_ITEM8_P91_S6	On September 12, 2016 the Federal Circuit issued an opinion that, among other things, remanded the issue of enhanced damages to the trial court.
310764_18_ITEM8_P91_S7	On July 12, 2017 the trial court reaffirmed its award of enhanced damages and entered a judgment of $164 in our favor.
310764_18_ITEM8_P91_S8	On July 24, 2017 Zimmer filed a notice of appeal of this decision.
310764_18_ITEM8_P92_S0	We have purchase commitments for materials, supplies, services and property, plant and equipment as part of the normal course of business.

310764_18_ITEM8_P98_S0	We measure the cost of employee stock options based on the grant-date fair value and recognize that cost using the straight-line method over the period in which a recipient is required to provide services in exchange for the options, typically the vesting period.
310764_18_ITEM8_P99_S0	weighted-average fair value per share of options is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
310764_18_ITEM8_P100_S0	The risk-free interest rate for periods within the expected life of options granted is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
310764_18_ITEM8_P101_S0	Expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock.
310764_18_ITEM8_P101_S1	The expected option life, representing the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, is based on historical option exercise and employee termination data.

310764_18_ITEM8_P109_S1	Interest expense, including required fees incurred on outstanding debt and credit facilities that were included in other expense, totaled $247 , $228 , and $108 in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
310764_18_ITEM8_P110_S0	Our effective tax rate was 50.6% , 14.3% and 17.1% for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
310764_18_ITEM8_P110_S1	The effective income tax rate for 2017 reflects the impact of complying with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, signed into law in December 2017, partially offset by the benefits from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 Compensation-Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting on January 1, 2017 and continued lower effective income tax rates as a result of the European headquarters.
310764_18_ITEM8_P110_S2	The establishment of the European regional headquarters contributed to the lower effective income tax rates in 2016 and 2015.
310764_18_ITEM8_P111_S0	In December 2017 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Act) was signed into law in the United States.
310764_18_ITEM8_P111_S1	The law includes significant changes to the United States corporate income tax system, including a federal corporate rate reduction, limitations on the deductibility of certain expenses, and the transition of United States international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system.
310764_18_ITEM8_P112_S0	As part of the transition to a territorial tax system, the Act requires taxpayers to calculate a one-time transition tax based on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
310764_18_ITEM8_P112_S1	We recorded the transition tax in our current year results which significantly impacted our effective tax rate.
310764_18_ITEM8_P112_S2	Additionally, we recorded additional tax expense to adjust certain deferred tax accounts to the new corporate tax rate.
310764_18_ITEM8_P112_S3	These amounts are our best estimate based on the current information and guidance available at this time and represent provisional estimates of the transition tax related charge and change in deferred tax accounts charge associated with the Act and will be finalized in 2018.
310764_18_ITEM8_P113_S0	Interest and penalties included in other income (expense), net were expense of ($28) , ($1) and ($4) in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
310764_18_ITEM8_P114_S0	The United States federal deferred income tax expense (benefit) includes the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards of $32 , $28 and $79 in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
310764_18_ITEM8_P115_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_18_ITEM8_P116_S0	Accrued interest and penalties were $60 and $34 on December 31, 2017 and 2016 , which were reported in current and non-current accrued expenses and other liabilities.
310764_18_ITEM8_P116_S1	Net operating loss carryforwards totaling $219 on December 31, 2017 are available to reduce future taxable earnings of certain domestic and foreign subsidiaries.
310764_18_ITEM8_P116_S2	United States loss carryforwards of $106 expire through 2028.
310764_18_ITEM8_P116_S3	International loss carryforwards of $113 began to expire in 2017 ; however, some have no expiration.
310764_18_ITEM8_P116_S4	Of these carryforwards, $36 are subject to a full valuation allowance.
310764_18_ITEM8_P116_S5	We also have a tax credit carryforward of $43 with $40 being subject to a full valuation allowance.
310764_18_ITEM8_P116_S6	The credits with a full valuation allowance have no expiration; however, we do not anticipate generating income tax in excess of the credits in the foreseeable future.
310764_18_ITEM8_P116_S7	We recorded a transition tax on undistributed foreign earnings as required by the Act.
310764_18_ITEM8_P116_S8	No other provision was made for income taxes that may result from future remittances of the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are determined to be indefinitely reinvested, which were $8,484 on December 31, 2017 .
310764_18_ITEM8_P116_S9	Determination of the total amount of unrecognized deferred income tax on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries is not practicable.
310764_18_ITEM8_P117_S0	Our income tax expense would have been reduced by $232 and $209 on December 31, 2017 and 2016 had these uncertain income tax positions been favorably resolved.
310764_18_ITEM8_P118_S0	that are the subject of controversy in various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate, including inventory transfer pricing, cost sharing, product royalty and foreign branch arrangements.
310764_18_ITEM8_P118_S1	We are not able to reasonably estimate the amount or the future periods in which changes in unrecognized tax benefits may be resolved.
310764_18_ITEM8_P119_S0	Interest and penalties incurred associated with uncertain tax positions are included in other income (expense), net.
310764_18_ITEM8_P120_S0	In the normal course of business, income tax authorities in various income tax jurisdictions both within the United States and internationally conduct routine audits of our income tax returns filed in prior years.
310764_18_ITEM8_P120_S1	These audits are generally designed to determine if individual income tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretations of complex income tax regulations regarding the allocation of income to the various income tax jurisdictions.
310764_18_ITEM8_P121_S0	Income tax years are open from 2012 through the current year for the United States federal jurisdiction.
310764_18_ITEM8_P121_S1	Income tax years open for our other major jurisdictions range from 2005 through the current year.
310764_18_ITEM8_P122_S0	NOTE 11 - RETIREMENT PLANS Defined Contribution Plans We provide certain employees with defined contribution plans and other types of retirement plans.
310764_18_ITEM8_P122_S1	A portion of our retirement plan expense under the defined contribution plans is funded with Stryker common stock.
310764_18_ITEM8_P122_S2	The use of Stryker common stock represents a non-cash operating activity that is not reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
310764_18_ITEM8_P123_S0	Defined Benefit Plans Certain of our subsidiaries have both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans covering some or all of their employees.
310764_18_ITEM8_P123_S1	Substantially all of the defined benefit pension plans have projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets.
310764_18_ITEM8_P123_S2	The discount rates were selected using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds on December 31 that would provide the necessary cash flows to match our projected benefit payments.
310764_18_ITEM8_P123_S3	Effective January 1, 2017, in countries where it was possible, we elected to change the method to calculate the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for our defined benefit plans and will measure these costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve of the projected cash flows for the respective plans.
310764_18_ITEM8_P123_S4	Our defined benefit plans previously utilized the yield curve approach to establish discount rates and we believe the new approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates.
310764_18_ITEM8_P123_S5	The change does not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations for those plans and is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate inseparable from a change in accounting principle, which is applied prospectively.
310764_18_ITEM8_P123_S6	The reductions in service and interest costs for 2017 associated with this change in estimate are nominal.
310764_18_ITEM8_P124_S0	The expected return on plan assets is determined by applying the target allocation in each asset category of plan investments to the anticipated return for each asset category based on historical and projected returns.
310764_18_ITEM8_P125_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_18_ITEM8_P126_S0	The investment strategy for our defined benefit pension plans is to meet the liabilities of the plans as they fall due and to maximize the return on invested assets within appropriate risk tolerances.
310764_18_ITEM8_P127_S0	total estimated amortization of prior service credit and transition asset for the defined benefit pension plans to be reclassified from AOCI into net periodic benefit credit is $1 in 2018 .
310764_18_ITEM8_P128_S0	Our Level 3 pension plan assets consist primarily of guaranteed investment contracts with insurance companies.
310764_18_ITEM8_P128_S1	The insurance contracts guarantee us principal repayment and a fixed rate of return.
310764_18_ITEM8_P129_S0	The $11 increase in Level 3 pension plan assets is primarily related to actual returns and acquired assets.
310764_18_ITEM8_P129_S1	We expect to contribute $24 to our defined benefit pension plans in 2018 .
310764_18_ITEM8_P130_S0	Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
310764_18_ITEM8_P131_S0	NOTE 13 - SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA We segregate our operations into three reportable business segments: Orthopaedics, MedSurg, and Neurotechnology and Spine.
310764_18_ITEM8_P131_S1	The Corporate and Other category shown in the table below includes corporate and administration, corporate initiatives and share-based compensation, which includes compensation related to employee stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock unit grants and director stock options and restricted stock unit grants.
310764_18_ITEM8_P132_S0	We measure the financial results of our reportable segments using an internal performance measure that excludes acquisition and integration-related charges, restructuring-related charges, reserves for certain product recall matters, reserves for certain legal and regulatory matters and a donation to an educational institution.
310764_18_ITEM8_P133_S0	Identifiable assets are those assets used exclusively in the operations of each business segment or allocated when used jointly.
310764_18_ITEM8_P133_S1	Corporate assets are principally cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and property, plant and equipment.
310764_18_ITEM8_P133_S2	The countries in which we have local revenue generating operations have been combined into the following geographic areas: the United States (including Puerto Rico); Europe, Middle East, Africa; Asia Pacific; and other foreign countries, which include Canada and countries in the Latin American region.
310764_18_ITEM8_P134_S0	Net sales are reported based off the geographic area of the Stryker location where the sales to the customer originated.
310764_18_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company's management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (the Certifying Officers), evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) (Exchange Act) at December 31, 2017 .
310764_18_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on that evaluation, the Certifying Officers concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2017 .
310764_18_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change to our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2017 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

310764_18_ITEM9A_P2_S0	MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
310764_18_ITEM9A_P2_S1	The Company's internal control over financial reporting was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company's management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
310764_18_ITEM9A_P2_S2	The Company's management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on December 31, 2017 .
310764_18_ITEM9A_P2_S3	In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) .
310764_18_ITEM9A_P2_S4	Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017 .
310764_18_ITEM9A_P2_S5	The Company's management excluded NOVADAQ Technologies, Inc. (NOVADAQ) acquired on September 1, 2017 and VEXIM, acquired on October 24, 2017, from its evaluation of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 .
310764_18_ITEM9A_P2_S6	As of December 31, 2017 NOVADAQ and VEXIM represented approximately 4.2% of our consolidated total assets and a de minimus percentage of our consolidated net sales for 2017.
310764_18_ITEM9A_P3_S0	We have audited Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
310764_18_ITEM9A_P3_S1	In our opinion, Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on the COSO criteria.
310764_18_ITEM9A_P3_S2	As indicated in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of NOVADAQ and VEXIM which are included in the December 31, 2017 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted 4.2% and 0.2% of total assets and net sales, respectively, as of, and for the year-ended, December 31, 2017.
310764_18_ITEM9A_P3_S3	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of NOVADAQ and VEXIM.
310764_18_ITEM9A_P4_S0	(PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income, shareholder s equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) of the Company and our report dated February 8, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
310764_18_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Basis for Opinion The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
310764_18_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
310764_18_ITEM9A_P4_S3	We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
310764_18_ITEM9A_P4_S4	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
310764_18_ITEM9A_P4_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
310764_18_ITEM9A_P4_S6	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
310764_18_ITEM9A_P4_S7	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
310764_18_ITEM9A_P5_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
310764_18_ITEM9A_P5_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
310764_18_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
310764_18_ITEM9A_P5_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
