21510_11_ITEM1_P0_S0	Business Overview Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30.
21510_11_ITEM1_P0_S1	Fiscal years 2011 , 2010 and 2009 ended on October 1 , October 2 , and October 3 , respectively, and are referred to in this annual report as fiscal 2011 , fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 for convenience.
21510_11_ITEM1_P0_S2	Fiscal years 2011 and 2010 included 52 weeks; fiscal year 2009 included 53 weeks.
21510_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	We are one of the world's leading suppliers of photonics-based solutions in a broad range of commercial and scientific research applications.
21510_11_ITEM1_P1_S1	We design, manufacture, service and market lasers and related accessories for a diverse group of customers.
21510_11_ITEM1_P1_S2	Since inception in 1966, we have grown through internal expansion and through strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies, intellectual property, manufacturing processes and product offerings.
21510_11_ITEM1_P1_S3	We are organized into two operating segments: Commercial Lasers and Components ("CLC") and Specialty Lasers and Systems ("SLS").
21510_11_ITEM1_P1_S4	This segmentation reflects the go-to-market strategies for various products and markets.
21510_11_ITEM1_P1_S5	While both segments deliver cost-effective photonics solutions, CLC focuses on higher volume products that are offered in set configurations.
21510_11_ITEM1_P1_S6	The product architectures are designed for easy exchange at the point of use such that substantially all product service and repairs are based upon advanced replacement and depot (i.e., factory) repair.
21510_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	CLC's primary markets include materials processing and original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") components and instrumentation.
21510_11_ITEM1_P2_S1	SLS develops and manufactures configurable, advanced performance products largely serving the microelectronics, OEM components and instrumentation and scientific research and government programs markets.
21510_11_ITEM1_P2_S2	The size and complexity of many of the SLS products require service to be performed at the customer site by factory-trained field service engineers.
21510_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	Effective as of the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we moved our diode pumped solid state ("DPSS") Germany and Crystal product families from the CLC segment into the SLS segment.
21510_11_ITEM1_P3_S1	This concentrated all DPSS product families in the SLS segment.
21510_11_ITEM1_P3_S2	All reporting has been aligned to reflect the revised reportable operating segments (CLC and SLS) and prior periods have been restated.
21510_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	See additional discussion in Note 18 "Segment and Geographic Information" of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Income (loss) from operations is the measure of profit and loss that our chief operating decision maker ("CODM") uses to assess performance and make decisions.
21510_11_ITEM1_P4_S1	Income (loss) from operations represents the sales less the cost of sales and direct operating expenses incurred within the operating segments as well as allocated expenses such as shared sales and manufacturing costs.
21510_11_ITEM1_P4_S2	We do not allocate to our operating segments certain operating expenses, which we manage separately at the corporate level.
21510_11_ITEM1_P4_S3	These unallocated costs include stock-based compensation and corporate functions (certain advanced research and development, management, finance, legal and human resources) and are included in Corporate and other.
21510_11_ITEM1_P4_S4	Management does not consider unallocated Corporate and other costs in its measurement of segment performance.
21510_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	We were originally incorporated in California on May 26, 1966 and reincorporated in Delaware on October 1, 1990.

21510_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	Any product, product name, process, or technology described in these materials is the property of Coherent, Inc.
21510_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	A laser emits an intense coherent beam of light with some unique and highly useful properties.
21510_11_ITEM1_P7_S1	Most importantly, a laser is orders of magnitude brighter than any lamp.
21510_11_ITEM1_P7_S2	As a result of its coherence, the beam can be focused to a very small and intense spot, useful for applications requiring very high power densities including cutting and other materials processing procedures.
21510_11_ITEM1_P7_S3	The laser's high spatial resolution is also useful for microscopic imaging and inspection applications.
21510_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	Laser light can be monochromatic all the beam energy is confined to a narrow wavelength band.
21510_11_ITEM1_P8_S1	Some lasers can be used to create ultrafast output a series of pulses with pulse durations as short as attoseconds (i.e., 10 -18 seconds).
21510_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	There are many types of lasers and one way of classifying them is by the material or medium used to create the lasing action.
21510_11_ITEM1_P9_S1	This can be in the form of a gas, liquid, semiconductor or solid state crystal.
21510_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	output wavelength: ultraviolet, visible, infrared or wavelength tunable.
21510_11_ITEM1_P10_S1	We manufacture all of these laser types.
21510_11_ITEM1_P10_S2	There are also many options in terms of pulsed output versus continuous wave, pulse duration, output power, beam dimensions, etc.
21510_11_ITEM1_P10_S3	In fact, each application has its specific requirements in terms of laser performance.
21510_11_ITEM1_P10_S4	The broad technical depth at Coherent enables us to offer a diverse set of product lines characterized by lasers targeted at growth opportunities and key applications.
21510_11_ITEM1_P10_S5	In all cases, we aim to be the supplier of choice by offering a high-value combination of superior technical performance and high reliability.
21510_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	Photonics has taken its place alongside electronics as a critical enabling technology for the twenty-first century.
21510_11_ITEM1_P11_S1	Photonics based solutions are entrenched in broad industries that include industrial automation, textile processing, microelectronics, flat panel displays and medical diagnostics, with adoption continuing in ever more diverse applications.
21510_11_ITEM1_P11_S2	Growth in these applications stems from two sources.
21510_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	First, there are many applications where the laser is displacing conventional technology because it can do the job faster, better or more economically.
21510_11_ITEM1_P12_S1	Second, there are new applications where the laser is the enabling tool that makes the work possible (e.g., the production of sub 50 micron microvias) used in the manufacture of high density printed circuit boards found in the latest smartphones and tablet computers.
21510_11_ITEM1_P12_S2	Key laser applications include: micro and nanotechnologies; solar cell production; semiconductor inspection; microlithography; measurement, test and repair of electronic circuits; flat panel display manufacturing; medical and bio-instrumentation; industrial process and quality control; materials processing; imaging and printing; graphic arts and display; and, research and development.
21510_11_ITEM1_P12_S3	For example, ultraviolet ("UV") lasers are enabling the move towards miniaturization, which drives innovation and growth in many markets.
21510_11_ITEM1_P12_S4	The short wavelength of lasers that produce light in the UV spectral region makes it possible to manufacture extremely small structures with maximum precision consistent with the latest state-of-the-art technology.
21510_11_ITEM1_P12_S5	We strive to develop innovative and proprietary products and solutions that meet the needs of our customers and that are based on our core expertise in lasers and optical technologies.
21510_11_ITEM1_P12_S6	In pursuit of our strategy, we intend to:
21510_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	Leverage our technology portfolio and application engineering to lead the proliferation of photonics into broader markets We will continue to identify opportunities in which our technology portfolio and application engineering can be used to offer innovative solutions and gain access to new markets.
21510_11_ITEM1_P13_S1	We plan to utilize our expertise to expand into new markets, such as laser-based processing development tools for solar manufacturing and high power materials processing solutions.
21510_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	Optimize our leadership position in existing markets There are a number of markets where we have historically been at the forefront of technological development and product deployment and from which we have derived a substantial portion of our revenues.
21510_11_ITEM1_P14_S1	We plan to optimize our financial returns from these markets.
21510_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	Maintain and develop additional strong collaborative customer and industry relationships We believe that the Coherent brand name and reputation for product quality, technical performance and customer satisfaction will help us to further develop our loyal customer base.
21510_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	We plan to maintain our current customer relationships and develop new ones with customers who are industry leaders and work together with these customers to design and develop innovative product systems and solutions as they develop new technologies.
21510_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	Develop and acquire new technologies and market share We will continue to enhance our market position through our existing technologies and develop new technologies through our internal research and development efforts, as well as through the acquisition of additional complementary technologies, intellectual property, manufacturing processes and product offerings.
21510_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	Streamline our manufacturing structure and improve our cost structure We will focus on optimizing the mix of products that we manufacture internally and externally.
21510_11_ITEM1_P17_S1	We will utilize vertical integration where our internal manufacturing process is considered proprietary and seek to leverage external sources when the capabilities and cost structure are well developed and on a path towards commoditization.
21510_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	Focus on long-term improvement of adjusted EBITDA, in dollars and as a percentage of net sales We define adjusted EBITDA as operating income adjusted for depreciation, amortization, stock compensation expenses, major restructuring costs and certain other non-operating income and expense items.
21510_11_ITEM1_P18_S1	Key initiatives to reach our goals for EBITDA improvements include utilization of our Asian manufacturing locations, rationalizing our supply chain and continued leveraging of our infrastructure.
21510_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	APPLICATIONS Our products address a broad range of applications that we group into the following markets: Microelectronics, Scientific Research and Government Programs, OEM Components and Instrumentation and Materials Processing.
21510_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	Microelectronics Nowhere is the trend towards miniaturization more prevalent than in the Microelectronics market where smart phones, tablets, ultrabooks, personal computers ("PC's") and televisions ("TV's") are driving advances in displays, integrated circuits and printed circuit boards ("PCB's").
21510_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	In response to market demands and expectations, semiconductor and device manufacturers are continually seeking to improve their process and design technologies in order to manufacture smaller, more powerful and more reliable devices at lower cost.
21510_11_ITEM1_P21_S1	New laser applications and new laser technologies are a key element in delivering higher resolution and higher precision at lower manufacturing cost.
21510_11_ITEM1_P21_S2	We support four major markets in the microelectronics industry: (1) flat panel display manufacturing, (2) advanced packaging and interconnects, (3) semiconductor front-end, and (4) solar cell production and other emerging processes.
21510_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	Microelectronics flat panel display manufacturing The high-volume consumer market is driving the production of flat panel displays ("FPDs") in applications such as mobile telephones, tablets, ultrabooks, laptop computers, television monitors, digital cameras, personal digital assistants ("PDAs") and car navigation systems.
21510_11_ITEM1_P22_S1	There are several types of established and emerging displays based on quite different technologies, including plasma ("PDP"), liquid crystal ("LCD") and organic polymers ("OLED").
21510_11_ITEM1_P22_S2	Lasers have found applications in each of these technologies given that the laser provides higher process speed, better yield, improved battery life, lower cost and/or superior display brightness and resolution.
21510_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	Several display types require a high-density pattern of silicon Thin Film Transistors ("TFTs").
21510_11_ITEM1_P23_S1	If this silicon is polycrystalline, the performance is greatly enhanced.
21510_11_ITEM1_P23_S2	In the past, these polysilicon layers could only be produced on expensive special glass at high temperatures.
21510_11_ITEM1_P23_S3	However, excimer based processes, such as excimer laser annealing ("ELA") have allowed high-volume production of low-temperature polysilicon ("LTPS") on conventional glass substrates.
21510_11_ITEM1_P23_S4	Our excimer lasers provide an invaluable solution for LTPS because they are the only industrial-grade excimer lasers with the high pulse energy optimized for this application.
21510_11_ITEM1_P23_S5	The current state-of-the-art product for this application is our excimer VYPER laser, which delivers over 1000W of power, enabling customers to scale to current Generation 5 5.5 substrates and in the near future up to Generation 8 sizes, when coupled with our latest 750mm length Line Beam optical delivery system (LB-750).
21510_11_ITEM1_P23_S6	These systems are integral to the manufacturing process on all leading LTPS based smartphone displays, with the highest commercially available pixel densities of greater than 300 pixels per inch (ppi) and hold the potential for widespread deployment in tablet computing and future OLED TV manufacturing.
21510_11_ITEM1_P23_S7	Our AVIA and DIAMOND lasers are also used in other production processes for FPDs.
21510_11_ITEM1_P23_S8	These processes include drilling, cutting, patterning, marking and yield improvement.
21510_11_ITEM1_P23_S9	Lasers have also become a valuable tool in high-brightness (HB) LED manufacturing, improving LED performance and yield.
21510_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	LED has seen rapid growth in the last year due to widespread adoption as the light source in all categories of LCD displays, from phones all the way to full size TV's.
21510_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	Our lasers are used in the back-end processing of HB-LEDs.
21510_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	Microelectronics advanced packaging and interconnects After a wafer is patterned, there are then a host of other processes, referred to as back-end processing, which finally result in a packaged encapsulated silicon chip.
21510_11_ITEM1_P26_S1	Ultimately, these chips are then assembled into finished products.
21510_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	The advent of high-speed logic and high-memory content devices has caused chip manufacturers to look for alternative technologies to improve performance and lower process costs.
21510_11_ITEM1_P27_S1	In terms of materials, this search includes new types of wafers based on low-k materials and thinner silicon.
21510_11_ITEM1_P27_S2	Our AVIA and Matrix lasers are providing economic methods of cutting and scribing these wafers while delivering higher yields than traditional mechanical methods.
21510_11_ITEM1_P27_S3	Our DIAMOND carbon dioxide ("CO 2 ") lasers are used for singulating packages and printed circuit boards into individual components for final assembly.
21510_11_ITEM1_P27_S4	Our Talisker lasers are used in a broad range of applications requiring high precision and low heat damage, such as in thin wafer cutting and drilling.
21510_11_ITEM1_P27_S5	These same trends are also driving integration and miniaturization, blurring the traditional lines between formerly discrete applications such as assembly and PCB fabrication.
21510_11_ITEM1_P27_S6	Lasers are playing several enabling roles in this integration and miniaturization.
21510_11_ITEM1_P27_S7	For instance, lasers are now the only economically practical method for drilling microvias in chip assemblies and in both rigid and flexible printed circuit boards.
21510_11_ITEM1_P27_S8	These microvias are tiny interconnects that are essential for enabling high-density circuitry commonly used in mobile handsets and advanced computing systems.
21510_11_ITEM1_P27_S9	Our AVIA and DIAMOND lasers are the lasers of choice in this application.
21510_11_ITEM1_P27_S10	The ability of these lasers to operate at very high repetition rates translates into faster drilling speeds and increased throughput in Microvia processing applications.
21510_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	Other applications have developed as well.
21510_11_ITEM1_P28_S1	For instance, the high density of the latest circuit boards is reaching the limits of conventional printing technologies, causing wider adoption of laser direct write methods.
21510_11_ITEM1_P28_S2	Our Paladin laser is used for this application.
21510_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	Microelectronics semiconductor front-end The term "front-end" refers to the production of semiconductor devices which occurs prior to packaging.
21510_11_ITEM1_P29_S1	As semiconductor device geometries decrease in size, devices become increasingly susceptible to smaller defects during each phase of the manufacturing process and these defects can negatively impact yield.
21510_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	One of the semiconductor industry's responses to the increasing vulnerability of semiconductor devices to smaller defects has been to use defect detection and inspection techniques that are closely linked to the manufacturing process.
21510_11_ITEM1_P30_S1	For example, automated laser-based inspection systems are now used to detect and locate defects as small as 0.01 micron, which may not be observable by conventional optical microscopes.
21510_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	Detecting the presence of defects is only the first step in preventing their recurrence.
21510_11_ITEM1_P31_S1	After detection, defects must be examined in order to identify their size, shape and the process step in which the defect occurred.
21510_11_ITEM1_P31_S2	This examination is called defect classification.
21510_11_ITEM1_P31_S3	Identification of the sources of defects in the lengthy and complex semiconductor manufacturing process has become essential for maintaining high yield production.
21510_11_ITEM1_P31_S4	Semiconductor manufacturing has become an around-the-clock operation and it is important for products used for inspection, measurement and testing to be reliable and to have long lifetimes.
21510_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	Our Azure, Paladin, Sapphire, and Excimer lasers are used to detect and characterize defects in semiconductor chips.
21510_11_ITEM1_P32_S1	Some of these are transitioning to volume production in the present timeframe while others are more forward-looking.
21510_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	Today's higher energy costs have led to heightened interest in solar panels.
21510_11_ITEM1_P33_S1	The interest in solar cell technology coupled with the intense focus on improving cell efficiency, is driving the adoption of laser technology in the manufacturing of solar cells.
21510_11_ITEM1_P33_S2	Our lasers, such as AVIA, Paladin, Matrix and Talisker, are used in the production of solar panels with applications such as dopant activation in the Crystalline Silicon (C:Si) cells and transparent conductive oxide ("TCO") scribing purposes in Thin Film designs.
21510_11_ITEM1_P33_S3	We have introduced a number of complete solutions for certain processes in the manufacturing of solar cells including the Coherent Equinox laser system and the Aethon laser system.
21510_11_ITEM1_P33_S4	These systems are based on Coherent lasers and can be used in a production or process development environment.
21510_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	Scientific research and government programs We are widely recognized as a technology innovator and the scientific market has historically provided an ideal "test market" for our leading-edge innovations.
21510_11_ITEM1_P34_S1	These have included ultrafast lasers, DPSS lasers, continuous-wave ("CW") systems, excimer gas lasers and water-cooled ion gas lasers.
21510_11_ITEM1_P34_S2	Our portfolio of lasers that address the scientific research market is broad and includes our Chameleon, COMPexPro, Evolution, Legend, Libra, MBD, MBR, Micra, Mira, Mantis and Verdi lasers.
21510_11_ITEM1_P34_S3	Many of the innovations and products pioneered in the scientific marketplace have become commercial successes for both our OEM customers and us.
21510_11_ITEM1_P34_S4	We have a large installed base of scientific lasers which are used in a wide range of applications spanning virtually every branch of science and engineering.
21510_11_ITEM1_P34_S5	These applications include biology and life science, engineering, physical chemistry and physics.
21510_11_ITEM1_P34_S6	Most of these applications require the use of ultrafast lasers that enable the generation of pulses short enough to be measured in attoseconds (10 -18 seconds).
21510_11_ITEM1_P34_S7	Because of these very short pulse durations, ultrafast lasers enable the study of fundamental physical and chemical processes with temporal resolution unachievable with any other tool.
21510_11_ITEM1_P34_S8	These lasers also deliver very high peak power and large bandwidths, which can be used to generate many exotic effects.
21510_11_ITEM1_P34_S9	Some of these are now finding their way into mainstream applications, such as microscopy or materials processing.
21510_11_ITEM1_P34_S10	In fact, the use of ultrafast lasers such as the Chameleon in microscopy is now a common occurrence in bio-imaging labs.
21510_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	OEM components and instrumentation Instrumentation is one of our more mature commercial applications.
21510_11_ITEM1_P35_S1	Representative applications within this market include bio-instrumentation, medical OEMs, graphic arts and display and machine vision.
21510_11_ITEM1_P35_S2	We also support the laser-based instrumentation market with a range of laser-related components, including diode lasers for optical pumping.
21510_11_ITEM1_P35_S3	Some of our OEM component business includes sales to other, less integrated laser manufacturers participating in OEM markets such as materials processing, scientific, and medical.
21510_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	Bio-instrumentation applications for lasers include bio-agent detection for point source and standoff detection of pathogens or other bio-toxins; confocal microscopy for biological imaging that allows researchers and clinicians to visualize cellular and subcellular structures and processes with an incredible amount of detail; DNA sequencing that provides automation and data acquisition rates that would be impossible by any other method; drug discovery genomic and proteomic analyses that enable drug discovery to proceed at very high throughput rates; and flow cytometry for analyzing single cells or populations of cells in a heterogeneous mixture, including blood samples.
21510_11_ITEM1_P36_S1	Specifically, our Sapphire, Compass and Coherent CUBE lasers are used in several bio-instrumentation applications.
21510_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	Medical Therapy We sell a variety of components and lasers to medical laser companies in end-user applications such as ophthalmology, aesthetic, surgical, therapeutic and dentistry.
21510_11_ITEM1_P37_S1	Our DIAMOND series CO 2 lasers are widely used in ophthalmic, aesthetic and surgical markets.
21510_11_ITEM1_P37_S2	Our Compass and Sapphire series of lasers are used in the retinal scanning market in diagnostic imaging systems as well as new ground breaking in-vivo imaging applications.
21510_11_ITEM1_P37_S3	In addition, we have a leading position in Lasik and photorefractive keratectomy ("PRK") surgery methods with our ExciStar XS excimer laser platform.
21510_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	The unique ability of our optically pumped semiconductor lasers ("OPSL") technology to match a wavelength to an application has led to the development of a high-power yellow (577nm) laser for the treatment of eye related diseases, such as Age Related Macular Degeneration and retinal diseases associated with diabetes.
21510_11_ITEM1_P38_S1	The 577nm wavelength was designed to match the peak in absorption of oxygenated hemoglobin thereby allowing treatment to occur at a lower power level, and thus reducing stress and heat-load placed on the eye with traditional green-based (530nm) solid state lasers.
21510_11_ITEM1_P38_S2	This technology is finding traction with both medical OEMs and ophthalmologists.
21510_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	Materials Processing Lasers are widely accepted today in many important industrial manufacturing applications including cutting, welding, joining, drilling, perforating, and marking of metals and nonmetals.
21510_11_ITEM1_P39_S1	We supply high-power lasers for metal processing and low-to-medium power lasers for laser marking, nonmetals processing and precision micromachining.
21510_11_ITEM1_P39_S2	Our high power industrial laser systems are used for cutting, cladding and hardening of metals, joining materials, and other materials processing applications.
21510_11_ITEM1_P39_S3	Other applications include welding of plastics and direct metal welding.
21510_11_ITEM1_P40_S0	Our Semiconductor business provides higher power arrays with powers in excess of 50Kilowatts through its proprietary cooling and stacking technology.
21510_11_ITEM1_P40_S1	This unique technology provides the engine for both our Highlight direct diode systems as well as our upcoming kW class fiber laser.
21510_11_ITEM1_P40_S2	Complementing our high power solid state lasers is our industry leading DIAMOND E1000 CO 2 laser.
21510_11_ITEM1_P40_S3	Introduced in 2009, this laser remains in high demand due to its high power, small size and completely sealed design - all ideal for material processing.
21510_11_ITEM1_P40_S4	Combining the high power Direct Diode, Fiber and CO 2 offerings with our MetaBeam 1000 flatbed cutting tool provides a strong, compelling four-pronged approach to meeting the needs of our diverse materials processing customers.
21510_11_ITEM1_P41_S0	In 2010 we acquired Beam Dynamics, Inc., a manufacturer of flexible laser cutting tools for the materials processing market.
21510_11_ITEM1_P41_S1	These tools, when combined with Coherent's medium to high power CO 2 lasers, offer a unique blend of performance and precision in a small lightweight tool for cutting of metals and non-metals.
21510_11_ITEM1_P42_S0	Enabled with the DIAMOND E1000, the new METABEAM 1000 offers the industry's most compact 1kW tool, with tools footprints at least 50% smaller than competitive designs.
21510_11_ITEM1_P42_S1	Operating costs, due to the sealed nature of the DIAMOND series of CO 2 lasers are 75% less than similar, but larger tools.
21510_11_ITEM1_P42_S2	We also participate in the low to medium power area, including such applications as the cutting, drilling and joining of host of materials using our DIAMOND CO 2 lasers; Highlight FAP semiconductor lasers in OEM opportunities and direct end user applications with the lower power OMNIBEAM and METABEAM cutting tools; applications including cutting, perforating and scoring of paper, thin metals and packaging materials; and various cutting and patterning applications in the textile, wood and sign industries.
21510_11_ITEM1_P42_S3	In the specific area of textiles and clothing, our DIAMOND lasers service older applications, such as cutting complex shapes in leather for footwear, as well as newer applications such as creating detailed fade patterns on designer denims.
21510_11_ITEM1_P42_S4	Laser marking and coding are generally considered part of the precision materials processing applications market for which we remain a leading supplier.
21510_11_ITEM1_P42_S5	One such area where applications are growing rapidly is the displacement of ink-jet coding due to both aesthetic and environmental pressures.
21510_11_ITEM1_P43_S0	The optimum choice of laser depends on the material being marked, whether it is a surface mark (engraved) or a sub-surface mark, and the specific economics of the application.
21510_11_ITEM1_P44_S0	We provide lasers for all important marking applications.
21510_11_ITEM1_P44_S1	Our DIAMOND C and GEM Series of CO 2 lasers provide many systems manufacturers with a reliable cost effective source for marking and engraving on non-metals.
21510_11_ITEM1_P45_S0	compact and low-cost diode pumped solid state lasers provides an ideal solution for marking of other materials in high volume manufacturing.
21510_11_ITEM1_P45_S1	FUTURE TRENDS Microelectronics Lasers are widely used in mass production microelectronics applications largely because they enable entirely new application capabilities that cannot be realized by any other known means.
21510_11_ITEM1_P45_S2	These laser-based fabrication and testing methods provide a level of precision, typically on a micrometer and nanometer level, that are unique, faster, are touch free, deliver superior end products, increase yields, and/or cut production costs.
21510_11_ITEM1_P45_S3	We anticipate this trend to continue, driven primarily by the increasing sophistication of consumer electronic goods and their convergence via the internet, resulting in increasing demand for better displays, more bandwidth and memory, while at the same time consuming less power.
21510_11_ITEM1_P45_S4	Although this market follows the macro-economic trends and carries inherit risks, we believe that Coherent is well positioned to continue to capitalize on the current market trends and that we will see continued increased adoption of our pulsed fiber, solid-state, CO 2 , direct diode and excimer lasers, as all these lasers enable entirely new applications, performance improvements and reduced process costs.
21510_11_ITEM1_P45_S5	LTPS based high resolution mobile displays (greater than 300ppi), and especially the emergence of OLED technology, look set to dominate the FPD technology trends of the future.
21510_11_ITEM1_P45_S6	We believe we are well positioned, especially with our Vyper Excimer lasers and LB optical systems, to take advantage of this trend, including the possibility of LTPS based OLED TVs.
21510_11_ITEM1_P45_S7	CO 2 , Avia, Talisker and direct diode lasers all seem aligned with the need for related FPD touch panel, thin film cutting, light guide technology, frit welding and glass cutting applications.
21510_11_ITEM1_P45_S8	Semiconductor devices look set to continue Moore's Law, shrinking device geometries for at least another decade, as well as expanding vertically into new 3D structures.
21510_11_ITEM1_P45_S9	As a result we believe our many deep UV laser sources (such as Paladin, Avia, Talisker, ExiStar and Matrix) will continue to find increasing adoption, since their unique optical properties align well with the process demands of a nanometer scale world.
21510_11_ITEM1_P45_S10	The same lasers plus CO 2 are also widely adopted for back end Advanced Packaging and Interconnect (API) applications.
21510_11_ITEM1_P45_S11	With dimension roadmaps showing a decade of dimension shrink on PCBs, interconnects, Silicon LED scribe widths and glass thickness, we believe that our portfolio of lasers aligns well with these demands as well as new processes that seem likely to be enabled by our lasers, to meet the increasing demands and decreasing tolerances of these markets.
21510_11_ITEM1_P46_S0	The short term outlook for solar is uncertain given the global economy, credit availability and the significant oversupply of cell production that exists at this time.
21510_11_ITEM1_P46_S1	The longer term outlook for this ultimate clean, free and abundant source of energy is expected to be strong; however, the timing is uncertain.
21510_11_ITEM1_P47_S0	We believe that the vast majority of leading solar cell manufacturers have laser based processes on their roadmap to enable higher conversion efficiencies.
21510_11_ITEM1_P48_S0	Lasers provide a touch-free manufacturing process on increasingly fragile substrates (as they get thinner).
21510_11_ITEM1_P48_S1	They also hold the promise of lower manufacturing costs and higher yield for certain process steps.
21510_11_ITEM1_P48_S2	We believe we are well positioned as this market matures, standardizes processes and recovers economically.
21510_11_ITEM1_P48_S3	The scientific market benefited from stimulus funding during fiscal 2011, with applications in ultrashort pulses and in bio-research being the drivers of this anticipated expansion.
21510_11_ITEM1_P48_S4	We anticipate the total amount of government-related funding for scientific research to decline from prior stimulus levels, but believe that as we push the boundaries of performance and ease of use in our ultrafast lasers, we have the potential to capture a larger share of the funds that are available by enabling our customers to win funding for new research fields that drive discovery.
21510_11_ITEM1_P48_S5	While these markets remain highly competitive, we believe our leadership position and new product pipeline will drive Attosecond science boundaries and Biological Imaging ease of use, enabling new research frontiers to be forged and we would expect a gain in market share as a result.
21510_11_ITEM1_P49_S0	The instrumentation market is seeing a gradual migration from the use of mature laser technologies, such as water-cooled ion gas lasers, to new technologies, primarily based on solid state and semiconductor lasers.
21510_11_ITEM1_P49_S1	Using our unique portfolio of such lasers, as well as our patented OPSL technology, we are able to both assist and stimulate this transition as well as to be the technology of choice for developing applications such as security and clinical diagnostics.
21510_11_ITEM1_P49_S2	Our OPSL technology resulted in the first truly continuous solid-state UV laser which enables the use of UV in a clinical as well as a research environment.
21510_11_ITEM1_P49_S3	Furthermore we anticipate greater future opportunities in bio-instrumentation, including DNA sequencing, drug discovery, flow cytometry, and microscopy, based on our product enhancements and evolving market developments, particularly in increased migration from clinical to point-of-care diagnostics.
21510_11_ITEM1_P50_S0	Our newer laser technologies are the basis of a number of clinical procedures.
21510_11_ITEM1_P51_S0	suitable for the treatment of blood vessels.

21510_11_ITEM1_P59_S0	TECHNOLOGIES Diode-pumped solid-state ("DPSS") lasers DPSS lasers use semiconductor lasers to pump a crystal to produce a laser beam.
21510_11_ITEM1_P59_S1	By changing the energy, optical components and the types of crystals used in the laser, different wavelengths and types of laser light can be produced.
21510_11_ITEM1_P60_S0	The efficiency, reliability, longevity and relatively low cost of DPSS lasers make them ideally suited for a wide range of OEM and end-user applications, particularly those requiring 24-hour operations.
21510_11_ITEM1_P61_S0	Our DPSS systems are compact and self-contained sealed units.
21510_11_ITEM1_P61_S1	Unlike conventional tools and other lasers, our DPSS lasers require minimal maintenance since they do not have internal controls or components that require adjusting and cleaning to maintain consistency.
21510_11_ITEM1_P61_S2	They are also less affected by environmental changes in temperature and humidity, which can alter alignment and inhibit performance in many systems.
21510_11_ITEM1_P62_S0	We manufacture a variety of types of DPSS lasers for different applications including semiconductor inspection; advanced packaging and interconnects; laser pumping; spectroscopy; bio-agent detection; DNA sequencing; drug discovery; flow cytometry; forensics; computer-to-plate printing; entertainment lighting (display); medical; rapid prototyping and marking, welding, engraving, cutting and drilling.
21510_11_ITEM1_P63_S0	Fiber lasers Fiber lasers use semiconductor lasers to pump a doped optical fiber to produce a laser beam.
21510_11_ITEM1_P63_S1	In fiscal 2008, we launched our first product based on fiber laser technology, the Talisker.
21510_11_ITEM1_P63_S2	This is an industrial ultrafast laser system which incorporates fiber laser technologies as a key part of the laser design.
21510_11_ITEM1_P63_S3	The Talisker is a new laser platform based on a fiber oscillator and crystal amplifier and is illustrative of our strategy of developing and incorporating fiber lasers where they can generate unique and cost-effective performance.
21510_11_ITEM1_P63_S4	We expect the Talisker platform will lead to a series of new ultrafast lasers for a number of commercial markets including microelectronics and medical.
21510_11_ITEM1_P64_S0	In fiscal 2009, we launched a program to address the kilowatt high power materials processing market.
21510_11_ITEM1_P64_S1	We have successfully demonstrated a 1 kilowatt fiber laser product based on our high power diode laser system, the Highlight 1000F.
21510_11_ITEM1_P64_S2	This prototype demonstrated the platform for a scalable, kilowatt class fiber laser based on a bar pumping design.
21510_11_ITEM1_P65_S0	Due to packaging efficiency, diode bars reduce the overall cost of a fiber laser.
21510_11_ITEM1_P65_S1	This platform will address the growing high power metal cutting and joining market and delivers a field serviceable solution.
21510_11_ITEM1_P65_S2	Fiber laser technology continues to be an important investment and product development area and we anticipate more products that incorporate fiber as the active gain medium.
21510_11_ITEM1_P65_S3	In fiscal 2010, we acquired the business assets of Stocker-Yale, Inc. which included a fiber manufacturing facility capable of producing both active and passive fibers.
21510_11_ITEM1_P66_S0	Gas lasers (CO 2 , Excimer, Ion) The breadth of our gas laser portfolio is industry leading, encompassing CO 2 , excimer and ion laser technologies.
21510_11_ITEM1_P67_S0	Gas lasers derive their name from the use of one or more gases as a lasing medium.
21510_11_ITEM1_P67_S1	They collectively span an extremely diverse and useful emission range, from the very deep ultraviolet to the far infrared.
21510_11_ITEM1_P67_S2	This diverse range of available wavelengths, coupled with high optical output power, and an abundance of other attractive characteristics, makes gas lasers extremely useful and popular for a variety of microelectronics, scientific, medical therapeutic and materials processing applications.
21510_11_ITEM1_P68_S0	Our OPSL platform is a surface emitting semiconductor laser that is energized or pumped by a semiconductor laser.
21510_11_ITEM1_P68_S1	The use of optical pumping circumvents inherent power scaling limitations of electrically pumped lasers, enabling very high powered devices.
21510_11_ITEM1_P68_S2	A wide range of wavelengths can be achieved by varying the semiconductor materials used in the device and changing the frequency of the laser beam using techniques common in solid state lasers.

21510_11_ITEM1_P72_S0	Lasers Ultrafast lasers are lasers generating light pulses with durations of a few femtoseconds (10 -15 seconds) to a few tens of picoseconds (10 -11 seconds).
21510_11_ITEM1_P72_S1	These types of lasers are primarily used for scientific research and also are finding use in sophisticated materials processing applications.
21510_11_ITEM1_P72_S2	Ultrafast lasers are usually pumped by a green DPSS laser.
21510_11_ITEM1_P73_S0	UF laser oscillators generate a train of pulses at 50-100 MHz, with peak powers of tens of Kilowatts, and UF laser amplifiers generate pulses at 10-500 kHz, with peak powers up to several Terawatts.
21510_11_ITEM1_P73_S1	The extremely short duration of UF laser pulses enables temporally resolving fast events like the dynamics of atoms or electrons.
21510_11_ITEM1_P73_S2	In addition, the high peak power enables so-called non-linear effects where several photons can be absorbed by a molecule at the same time.
21510_11_ITEM1_P73_S3	This type of process enables applications like multi-photon excitation microscopy or UF ablation of materials with minimal thermal damage.

21510_11_ITEM1_P89_S1	We have historically experienced decreased bookings and revenue in the first fiscal quarter compared to other quarters in our fiscal year due to the impact of time off and business closures at many of our customers due to year-end holidays.
21510_11_ITEM1_P89_S2	This historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's future net sales or financial performance.
21510_11_ITEM1_P90_S0	As of fiscal 2011 year-end, we had 2,309 employees.
21510_11_ITEM1_P90_S1	Approximately 391 of our employees are involved in research and development; 1,358 of our employees are involved in operations, manufacturing, service and quality assurance; and 560 of our employees are involved in sales, order administration, marketing, finance, information technology and other administrative functions.
21510_11_ITEM1_P91_S0	Our success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain employees.
21510_11_ITEM1_P91_S1	We face competition in this regard from other companies, research and academic institutions, government entities and other organizations.
21510_11_ITEM1_P91_S2	We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
21510_11_ITEM1_P91_S3	In January 2011, we acquired all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Hypertronics Pte Ltd for approximately $14.5 million in cash.

21510_11_ITEM1_P92_S1	Hypertronics has been included in our Specialty Lasers and Systems segment.
21510_11_ITEM1_P93_S0	In April 2010, we acquired Beam Dynamics, Inc. for $5.9 million in cash and $0.3 million in deferred compensation related to an employment contract, which was recognized in expense as earned.
21510_11_ITEM1_P94_S0	Beam Dynamics manufactures flexible laser cutting tools for the materials processing market.
21510_11_ITEM1_P94_S1	Beam Dynamics has been included in our Commercial Lasers and Components segment.
21510_11_ITEM1_P95_S0	In October 2009, we acquired all the assets and certain liabilities of StockerYale, Inc.'s ("StockerYale") laser module product line in Montreal and its specialty fiber product line in Salem, New Hampshire for $15.0 million in cash.
21510_11_ITEM1_P96_S0	StockerYale designs, develops and manufactures low power laser modules, light emitting diode (LED) systems and specialty optical fiber products.
21510_11_ITEM1_P96_S1	These assets and liabilities have been included in our Commercial Lasers and Components segment.
21510_11_ITEM1_P96_S2	We consummated no acquisitions in fiscal 2009.
21510_11_ITEM1_P96_S3	Business Combinations" of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the acquisition completed during fiscal 2011 .
21510_11_ITEM1_P97_S0	Salem, Massachusetts, Wilsonville, Oregon and Sunnyvale, California.
21510_11_ITEM1_P97_S1	The transfer was completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2011.
21510_11_ITEM1_P98_S0	The fiscal 2010 severance related costs are primarily comprised of severance pay, outplacement services, medical and other related benefits for employees being terminated due to the transition of activities out of Montreal, Canada, and Tampere, Finland.
21510_11_ITEM1_P98_S1	The fiscal 2011 severance related costs are primarily comprised of severance pay, outplacement services, medical and other related benefits for employees being terminated due to the transition of activities out of Tampere, Finland.
21510_11_ITEM1_P99_S0	During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we announced our plans to close our facilities in Tampere, Finland and St. Louis, Missouri.
21510_11_ITEM1_P99_S1	The closure of our St. Louis, Missouri and Yokohama, Japan sites were completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.
21510_11_ITEM1_P99_S2	The closure of our Finland site was scheduled for completion by the end of fiscal 2010, but we decided to delay the closure due to increased demand for products manufactured in Finland.
21510_11_ITEM1_P99_S3	In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we ceased manufacturing operations in our Finland facility and we exited the facility in the third quarter of fiscal 2011.
21510_11_ITEM1_P99_S4	These closure plans have resulted in charges primarily for employee termination and other exit related costs associated with a plan approved by management.
21510_11_ITEM1_P100_S0	During fiscal 2008, we consolidated our German DPSS manufacturing into our L beck, Germany site.
21510_11_ITEM1_P100_S1	The transfer was completed in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.
21510_11_ITEM1_P100_S2	On October 13, 2008, we announced the consolidation of the remainder of our Munich facility into our G ttingen site.
21510_11_ITEM1_P100_S3	The transfer was completed in our third quarter of fiscal 2009.
21510_11_ITEM1_P100_S4	The consolidation and transfers have resulted in charges primarily for employee terminations, other exit related costs associated with a plan approved by management and a grant repayment liability.
21510_11_ITEM1_P101_S0	In April 2008, we announced that we entered into an agreement to sell certain assets of our Auburn Optics ("Auburn") manufacturing operation to Research Electro-Optics, Inc. ("REO"), a privately held optics manufacturing and technology company.
21510_11_ITEM1_P101_S1	We also entered into a strategic supply agreement with REO.
21510_11_ITEM1_P102_S0	REO is providing optical manufacturing capabilities for us, including fabrication and coating of optical components.
21510_11_ITEM1_P102_S1	The transition of the optics manufacturing assets from Auburn to REO was substantially completed in second quarter of fiscal 2009.
21510_11_ITEM1_P102_S2	The transition has resulted in charges primarily for employee terminations, supplier qualification, moving costs for related equipment, and other exit related costs associated with a plan approved by management.
21510_11_ITEM1_P103_S0	Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local environmental protection regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials, chemicals, various radioactive materials and certain waste products.
21510_11_ITEM1_P104_S0	In the United States, we are subject to the federal regulation and control of the Environmental Protection Agency.
21510_11_ITEM1_P104_S1	Comparable authorities are involved in other countries.
21510_11_ITEM1_P105_S0	We believe that compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive and financial position.
21510_11_ITEM1_P105_S1	Although we believe that our safety procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of such materials comply with the standards required by federal and state laws and regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials.
21510_11_ITEM1_P105_S2	In the event of such an accident involving such materials, we could be liable for damages and such liability could exceed the amount of our liability insurance coverage and the resources of our business.
21510_11_ITEM1_P106_S0	We may face potentially increasing complexity in our product designs and procurement operations as we adjust to requirements relating to the materials composition of products entering specific markets.
21510_11_ITEM1_P106_S1	Such regulations went into effect in the European Union ("EU") in 2006, and China in 2007.
21510_11_ITEM1_P107_S0	We could face significant costs and liabilities in connection with product take-back legislation.
21510_11_ITEM1_P108_S0	Beginning in 2006, the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive made producers of electrical goods financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products.
21510_11_ITEM1_P108_S1	In addition, the EU has added the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals Regulation, otherwise known as the REACH Regulation, which further regulates substances and products imported, manufactured or sold within the EU.
21510_11_ITEM1_P108_S2	Similar laws are now pending in various jurisdictions around the world, including the United States.
21510_11_ITEM1_P109_S0	We are organized into two operating segments: Commercial Lasers and Components ("CLC") and Specialty Lasers and Systems ("SLS").
21510_11_ITEM1_P109_S1	This segmentation reflects the go-to-market strategies for various products and markets.
21510_11_ITEM1_P109_S2	While both segments work to deliver cost-effective photonics solutions, CLC focuses on higher volume products that are offered in set configurations.
21510_11_ITEM1_P109_S3	The product architectures are designed for easy exchange at the point of use such that product service and repairs are based upon advanced replacement and depot (i.e., factory) repair.
21510_11_ITEM1_P110_S0	SLS develops and manufacturers configurable, advanced-performance products largely serving the microelectronics and scientific research markets.
21510_11_ITEM1_P110_S1	The size and complexity of many of the SLS products require service to be performed at the customer site by factory-trained field service engineers.
21510_11_ITEM1_P111_S0	We have identified CLC and SLS as operating segments for which discrete financial information was available.
21510_11_ITEM1_P111_S1	Both units have dedicated engineering, manufacturing, product business management and product line management functions.
21510_11_ITEM1_P112_S0	A small portion of our outside revenue is attributable to projects and recently developed products for which a segment has not yet been determined.
21510_11_ITEM1_P113_S0	The associated direct and indirect costs are presented in the category of Corporate and other, along with other corporate costs.
21510_11_ITEM1_P114_S0	Effective as of the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2009, in order to align all of our diode-pumped solid state ("DPSS") technology into the same reportable operating segment, management moved the DPSS Germany and Crystal product families from the CLC segment into the SLS segment.
21510_11_ITEM1_P114_S1	This allows for leverage and efficiencies in many parts of the business.
21510_11_ITEM1_P115_S0	Crystal is primarily an internal supplier that supports the DPSS product family.
21510_11_ITEM1_P115_S1	This concentrates all DPSS product families in the SLS segment effective as of the first quarter of fiscal 2009.
21510_11_ITEM1_P115_S2	All reporting has been aligned to reflect the revised reportable operating segments (CLC and SLS).
21510_11_ITEM1_P116_S0	FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND EXPORT SALES Financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations for fiscal years 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , is set forth in Note 18, "Segment and Geographic Information" of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	You should carefully consider the followings risks when considering an investment in our Common Stock.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These risks could materially affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, cause the trading price of our Common Stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Coherent.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P0_S2	These risks are not exclusive, and additional risks to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, the factors mentioned under Forward-Looking Statements and the risk of our businesses described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, these risks and uncertainties described herein are not the only ones facing us.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our business, results of operations or financial conditions.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our operating results, including net sales, net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA percentage in dollars and as a percentage of net sales, as well as our stock price have varied in the past, and our future operating results will continue to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations based upon numerous factors, including those discussed in this Item 1A and throughout this report.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our stock price will continue to be subject to daily variations as well.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Our future operating results and stock price may not follow any past trends or meet our guidance and expectations.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our net sales and operating results, such as adjusted EBITDA percentage, net income (loss) and operating expenses, and our stock price have varied in the past and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year in the future.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We believe a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, could cause these variations and make them difficult to predict, including:
21510_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	distraction of management related to acquisition or divestment activities.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In addition, we often recognize a substantial portion of our sales in the last month of our fiscal quarters.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Our expenses for any given quarter are typically based on expected sales and if sales are below expectations in any given quarter, the adverse impact of the shortfall on our operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We also base our manufacturing on our forecasted product mix for the quarter.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	result in delays in the shipment of our products.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Accordingly, variations in timing of sales, particularly for our higher priced, higher margin products, can cause significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Due to these and other factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year comparisons of our historical operating results may not be meaningful.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	You should not rely on our results for any quarter or year as an indication of our future performance.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Our operating results in future quarters and years may be below public market analysts' or investors' expectations, which would likely cause the price of our stock to fall.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P6_S3	In addition, over the past several years, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the stock prices of many technology companies.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P6_S4	There has not always been a direct correlation between this volatility and the performance of particular companies subject to these stock price fluctuations.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Further, over the last twelve months, equity markets around the world have significantly fluctuated across most sectors.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P6_S6	These factors, as well as general economic and political conditions or investors' concerns regarding the credibility of corporate financial statements, may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our stock in the future.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We are exposed to risks associated with worldwide economic conditions and related uncertainties.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets, depressed consumer confidence, negative economic conditions, volatile corporate profits and reduced capital spending could negatively impact demand for our products.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	In particular, it is difficult to develop and implement strategy, sustainable business models and efficient operations, as well as effectively manage supply chain relationships in the face of such conditions including uncertainty regarding the ability of some of our suppliers to continue operations and provide us with uninterrupted supply flow.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Our ability to maintain our research and development investments in our broad product offerings may be adversely impacted in the event that our sales decline and do not increase in the future.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Spending and the timing thereof by consumers and businesses has a significant impact on our results and, where such spending is delayed or canceled, it could cause a material negative impact on our operating results.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The current global economic conditions remain uncertain and challenging.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Weakness in our end markets could negatively impact our revenue, gross margin and operating expenses, and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The recent financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets and the possibility that additional financial institutions may consolidate or go out of business have resulted in continued tightening in the credit markets, and lower levels of liquidity in some financial markets.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	There could be a number of follow-on effects from the tightened credit environment on our business, including the insolvency of key suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and/or manufacture products resulting in product delays; inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and/or customer insolvencies; and failure of financial institutions negatively impacting our treasury functions.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P10_S2	In the event our customers are unable to obtain credit or otherwise pay for our shipped products it could significantly impact our ability to collect on our outstanding accounts receivable.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments; impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments; interest rates; cash balances; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Volatility in the financial markets and any overall economic uncertainty increase the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Uncertainty about current global economic conditions could also continue to increase the volatility of our stock price.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	In addition, political and social turmoil related to international conflicts, terrorist acts and civil unrest may put further pressure on economic conditions in the United States and abroad.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Unstable economic, political and social conditions make it difficult for our customers, our suppliers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P11_S2	If such conditions persist, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Additionally, unstable economic conditions can provide significant pressures and burdens on individuals, which could cause them to engage in inappropriate business conduct.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P11_S4	See Part II, Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES-Inherent Limitations over Internal Control.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are managed through various banks around the world and volatility in the capital and credit market conditions could cause financial institutions to fail or materially harm service levels provided by such banks, both of which could have an adverse affect on our ability to timely access funds.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	World capital and credit markets have been and may continue to experience volatility and disruption.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	In some cases, the markets have exerted downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers, as well as pressured the solvency of some financial institutions.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P13_S2	These financial institutions, including banks, have had difficulty timely performing regular services and in some cases have failed or otherwise been largely taken over by governments.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We maintain our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments with a number of financial institutions around the world.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	ability to timely access our cash deposited with such institutions, or, in extreme circumstances the failure of such institutions could cause us to be unable to access cash for the foreseeable future.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P15_S1	If we are unable to quickly access our funds when we need them, we may need to increase the use of our existing credit lines or access more expensive credit, if available.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P15_S2	If we are unable to access our cash or if we access existing or additional credit or are unable to access additional credit, it could have a negative impact on our operations, including our reported net income.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We are exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Although we have not recognized any material losses on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, future declines in their market values could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Given the global nature of our business, we have investments both domestically and internationally.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	There has recently been growing pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, particularly in Europe where a majority of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are invested, which results in corresponding pressure on the valuation of the securities issued by such nations.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Additionally, our overall investment portfolio is often concentrated in certificates of deposit and money market funds.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We maintain a mix of government-issued securities.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, financial results, or other factors.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Additionally, liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations could result in decreased values for our investments in certain government securities.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P19_S5	As a result, the value or liquidity of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments could decline or become materially impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P19_S6	See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We depend on sole source or limited source suppliers, both internal and external, for some of our key components and materials, including exotic materials, certain cutting-edge optics and crystals, in our products, which make us susceptible to supply shortages or price fluctuations that could adversely affect our business.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We currently purchase several key components and materials used in the manufacture of our products from sole source or limited source suppliers, both internal and external.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Our failure to timely receive these key components and materials, such as the large optics used in our flat panel display manufacturing applications, could cause delays in the shipment of our products.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Some of these suppliers are relatively small private companies that may discontinue their operations at any time and which may be particularly susceptible to prevailing economic conditions.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Some of our suppliers are located in regions which may be susceptible to natural disasters, such as the recent flooding in Thailand and the earthquake, tsunami and resulting nuclear disaster in Japan.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P21_S4	We typically purchase our components and materials through purchase orders or agreed upon terms and conditions and we do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with many of these suppliers.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P21_S5	We may fail to obtain these supplies in a timely manner in the future.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P21_S6	We may experience difficulty identifying alternative sources of supply for certain components used in our products.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P21_S7	We would experience further delays while identifying, evaluating and testing the products of these potential alternative suppliers.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P21_S8	Furthermore, financial or other difficulties faced by these suppliers or significant changes in demand for these components or materials could limit their availability.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P21_S9	We continue to consolidate our supply base and move supplier locations.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P21_S10	When we transition locations we may increase our inventory of such products as a safety stock during the transition, which may cause the amount of inventory reflected on our balance sheet to increase.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P21_S11	Additionally, many of our customers rely on sole source suppliers.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P21_S12	In the event of a disruption of supply, orders from our customers could decrease or be delayed.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P21_S13	Any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these components or materials, or the inability to obtain these components and materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time, or our failure to properly manage these moves, would impair our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and could cause customers to cancel orders.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We have historically relied exclusively on our own production capability to manufacture certain strategic components, crystals, semiconductor lasers, lasers and laser-based systems.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Because we manufacture, package and test these components, products and systems at our own facilities, and such components, products and systems are not readily available from other sources, any interruption in manufacturing would adversely affect our business.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P22_S2	In addition, our failure to achieve adequate manufacturing yields of these items at our manufacturing facilities may materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to increase our sales volumes and decrease our costs to offset potential declines in the average selling prices ( ASPs ) of our products and, if we are unable to realize greater sales volumes and lower costs, our operating results may suffer.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our ability to increase our sales volume and our future success depends on the continued growth of the markets for lasers, laser systems and related accessories, as well as our ability to identify, in advance, emerging markets for laser-based systems.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P24_S1	We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify, on a timely basis, new high-growth markets in the future.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Moreover, we cannot assure you that new markets will develop for our products or our customers' products, or that our technology or pricing will enable such markets to develop.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Future demand for our products is uncertain and will depend to a great degree on continued technological development and the introduction of new or enhanced products.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P25_S2	If this does not continue, sales of our products may decline and our business will be harmed.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We have in the past experienced decreases in the ASPs of some of our products.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	As competing products become more widely available, the ASPs of our products may decrease.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P26_S2	If we are unable to offset any decrease in our ASPs by increasing our sales volumes, our net sales will decline.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P26_S3	In addition, to maintain our gross margins, we must continue to reduce the cost of manufacturing our products while maintaining their high quality.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	From time to time, our products, like many complex technological products, may fail in greater frequency than anticipated.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P27_S1	This can lead to further charges, which can result in higher costs, lower gross margins and lower operating results.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Furthermore, as ASPs of our current products decline, we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements with higher margins.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P27_S3	If we cannot maintain our gross margins, our operating results could be seriously harmed, particularly if the ASPs of our products decrease significantly.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new and enhanced products that meet the needs of our customers.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our current products address a broad range of commercial and scientific research applications in the photonics markets.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We cannot assure you that the market for these applications will continue to generate significant or consistent demand for our products.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Demand for our products could be significantly diminished by disrupting technologies or products that replace them or render them obsolete.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Furthermore, the new and enhanced products generally continue to be smaller in size and have lower ASPs, and therefore, we have to sell more units to maintain revenue levels.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Accordingly, we must continue to invest in research and development in order to develop competitive products.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to anticipate our customers' needs and develop products that address those needs.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Introduction of new products and product enhancements will require that we effectively transfer production processes from research and development to manufacturing and coordinate our efforts with those of our suppliers to achieve volume production rapidly.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P30_S2	If we fail to transfer production processes effectively, develop product enhancements or introduce new products in sufficient quantities to meet the needs of our customers as scheduled, our net sales may be reduced and our business may be harmed.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We face risks associated with our foreign operations and sales that could harm our financial condition and results of operations.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	For fiscal 2011 , fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 , 74% , 67% and 66% , respectively, of our net sales were derived from customers outside of the United States.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P32_S1	We anticipate that foreign sales, particularly in Asia, will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	A global economic slowdown or a natural disaster could have a negative effect on various foreign markets in which we operate, such as the earthquake, tsunami and resulting nuclear disaster during fiscal 2011 in Japan and the recent flooding in Thailand.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Such a slowdown may cause us to reduce our presence in certain countries, which may negatively affect the overall level of business in such countries.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Our foreign sales are primarily through our direct sales force.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Additionally, some foreign sales are made through foreign distributors and resellers.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Our foreign operations and sales are subject to a number of risks, including:
21510_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our business could also be impacted by international conflicts, terrorist and military activity, civil unrest and pandemic illness which could cause a slowdown in customer orders or cause customer order cancellations.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We are also subject to the risks of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, which could materially adversely affect the sales price of our products in foreign markets, as well as the costs and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P36_S1	While we use forward exchange contracts and other risk management techniques to hedge our foreign currency exposure, we remain exposed to the economic risks of foreign currency fluctuations.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We may not be able to protect our proprietary technology which could adversely affect our competitive advantage.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Maintenance of intellectual property rights and the protection thereof is important to our business.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P38_S1	We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P38_S2	We cannot assure you that our patent applications will be approved, that any patents that may be issued will protect our intellectual property or that any issued patents will not be challenged by third parties.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Other parties may independently develop similar or competing technology or design around any patents that may be issued to us.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P38_S4	We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P38_S5	Further, we may be required to enforce our intellectual property or other proprietary rights through litigation, which, regardless of success, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management's attention.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P38_S6	Additionally, there may be existing patents of which we are unaware that could be pertinent to our business and it is not possible for us to know whether there are patent applications pending that our products might infringe upon since these applications are often not publicly available until a patent is issued or published.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We may, in the future, be subject to claims or litigation from third parties, for claims of infringement of their proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of competitors or other rights holders.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P39_S1	These claims could result in costly litigation and the diversion of our technical and management personnel.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Adverse resolution of litigation may harm our operating results or financial condition.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	In recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States involving patents and other intellectual property rights.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P40_S1	This has been seen in our industry, for example in the recently concluded patent-related litigation between IMRA America, Inc. and IPG Photonics Corporation.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	From time to time, like many other technology companies, we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights, copyrights, trademark rights or other intellectual property rights which such third parties believe may cover certain of our products, processes, technologies or information.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P41_S1	In the future, we may be a party to litigation to protect our intellectual property or as a result of an alleged infringement of others' intellectual property whether through direct claims or by way of indemnification claims of our customers, as, in some cases, we contractually agree to indemnify our customers against third-party infringement claims relating to our products.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P41_S2	These claims and any resulting lawsuit, if successful, could subject us to significant liability for damages or invalidation of our proprietary rights.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P41_S3	These lawsuits, regardless of their success, would likely be time-consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Any potential intellectual property litigation could also force us to do one or more of the following:
21510_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	redesign the products that use the technology.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	If we are forced to take any of these actions or are otherwise a party to lawsuits of this nature, we may incur significant losses for which we do not have insurance and our business may be seriously harmed.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We do not have insurance to cover potential claims of this type.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	If our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable include declines in our stock price and market capitalization or future cash flows projections.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P45_S3	We recorded a material charge during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 related to the impairment of goodwill in our CLC operating segment.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P45_S4	A decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in market conditions, particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we used to calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units, could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an impairment charge.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P45_S5	Any such material charges, whether related to goodwill or purchased intangible assets, may have a material negative impact on our financial and operating results.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We are exposed to lawsuits in the normal course of business which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We are exposed to lawsuits in the normal course of our business, including product liability claims, if personal injury, death or commercial losses occur from the use of our products.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P47_S1	While we typically maintain business insurance, including directors' and officers' policies, litigation can be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations, including the potential impact of indemnification obligations for individuals named in any such lawsuits.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P47_S2	We may not, however, be able to secure insurance coverage on terms acceptable to us in the future.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P47_S4	An unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit, including a recall or redesign of products if ultimately determined to be defective, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We depend on skilled personnel to operate our business effectively in a rapidly changing market, and if we are unable to retain existing or hire additional personnel when needed, our ability to develop and sell our products could be harmed.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel will be a critical factor in determining whether we will be successful in the future.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Recruiting and retaining highly skilled personnel in certain functions continues to be difficult.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P50_S1	At certain locations where we operate, the cost of living is extremely high and it may be difficult to retain key employees and management at a reasonable cost.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P50_S2	We may not be successful in attracting, assimilating or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Our failure to attract additional employees and retain our existing employees could adversely affect our growth and our business.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and support personnel, any of whom may leave, which could harm our business and our results of operations.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P52_S0	The long sales cycles for our products may cause us to incur significant expenses without offsetting revenues.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Customers often view the purchase of our products as a significant and strategic decision.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P53_S1	As a result, customers typically expend significant effort in evaluating, testing and qualifying our products before making a decision to purchase them, resulting in a lengthy initial sales cycle.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P53_S2	While our customers are evaluating our products and before they place an order with us, we may incur substantial sales and marketing and research and development expenses to customize our products to the customer's needs.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P53_S3	We may also expend significant management efforts, increase manufacturing capacity and order long lead-time components or materials prior to receiving an order.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P53_S4	Even after this evaluation process, a potential customer may not purchase our products.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P53_S5	As a result, these long sales cycles may cause us to incur significant expenses without ever receiving revenue to offset such expenses.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P54_S0	The markets in which we sell our products are intensely competitive and increased competition could cause reduced sales levels, reduced gross margins or the loss of market share.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Competition in the various photonics markets in which we provide products is very intense.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Some of our competitors are large companies that have significant financial, technical, marketing and other resources.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P56_S1	These competitors may be able to devote greater resources than we can to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Some of our competitors are much better positioned than we are to acquire other companies in order to gain new technologies or products that may displace our product lines.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P56_S3	Any of these acquisitions could give our competitors a strategic advantage.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P56_S4	Any business combinations or mergers among our competitors, forming larger companies with greater resources, could result in increased competition, price reductions, reduced margins or loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Additional competitors may enter the markets in which we serve, both foreign and domestic, and we are likely to compete with new companies in the future.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P57_S1	We may encounter potential customers that, due to existing relationships with our competitors, are committed to the products offered by these competitors.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P57_S2	Further, our current or potential customers may determine to develop and produce products for their own use which are competitive to our products.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P57_S3	As a result of the foregoing factors, we expect that competitive pressures may result in price reductions, reduced margins, loss of sales and loss of market share.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P57_S4	In addition, in markets where there are a limited number of customers, competition is particularly intense.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Some of our laser systems are complex in design and may contain defects that are not detected until deployed by our customers, which could increase our costs and reduce our revenues.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Laser systems are inherently complex in design and require ongoing regular maintenance.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P59_S1	The manufacture of our lasers, laser products and systems involves a highly complex and precise process.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P59_S2	As a result of the technological complexity of our products, changes in our or our suppliers' manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective materials by us or our suppliers could result in a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and product reliability.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P59_S3	To the extent that we do not achieve and maintain our projected yields or product reliability, our business, operating results, financial condition and customer relationships would be adversely affected.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P59_S4	We provide warranties on a majority of our product sales, and reserves for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P59_S5	The determination of such reserves requires us to make estimates of failure rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P59_S6	We typically establish warranty reserves based on historical warranty costs for each product line.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P59_S7	If actual return rates and/or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates, adjustments to cost of sales may be required in future periods which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Our customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated under the end user's peak stress conditions.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P60_S1	In addition, some of our products are combined with products from other vendors, which may contain defects.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P60_S2	As a result, should problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P60_S3	If we are unable to identify and fix defects or other problems, we could experience, among other things:
21510_11_ITEM1A_P61_S0	legal actions by our customers and/or their end users.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P62_S0	The occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P63_S0	If we fail to accurately forecast component and material requirements for our products, we could incur additional costs and incur significant delays in shipments, which could result in a loss of customers.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We use rolling forecasts based on anticipated product orders and material requirements planning systems to determine our product requirements.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P64_S1	It is very important that we accurately predict both the demand for our products and the lead times required to obtain the necessary components and materials.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P64_S2	We depend on our suppliers for most of our product components and materials.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P64_S3	Lead times for components and materials that we order vary significantly and depend on factors including the specific supplier requirements, the size of the order, contract terms and current market demand for components.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P64_S4	For substantial increases in our sales levels of certain products, some of our suppliers may need at least nine months lead-time.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P65_S0	overestimate our component and material requirements, we may have excess inventory, which would increase our costs.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P65_S1	If we underestimate our component and material requirements, we may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt and delay delivery of our products to our customers.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P65_S2	Any of these occurrences would negatively impact our net sales, business or operating results.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Our increased reliance on contract manufacturing and other outsourcing may adversely impact our financial results and operations due to our decreased control over the performance and timing of certain aspects of our manufacturing.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Our manufacturing strategy includes partnering with contract manufacturers to outsource non-core subassemblies and less complex turnkey products, including some performed at international sites located in Asia and Eastern Europe.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Additionally, we have outsourced the manufacture of certain of our optics components to a third party.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P67_S2	Our ability to resume internal manufacturing operations for certain products and components in a timely manner may be eliminated.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P67_S3	The cost, quality, performance and availability of contract manufacturing operations are and will be essential to the successful production and sale of many of our products.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P67_S4	Our financial condition or results of operation could be adversely impacted if any contract manufacturer or other supplier is unable for any reason, including as a result of the impact of worldwide economic conditions, to meet our cost, quality, performance, and availability standards.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P67_S5	We may not be able to provide contract manufacturers with product volumes that are high enough to achieve sufficient cost savings.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P67_S6	If shipments fall below forecasted levels, we may incur increased costs or be required to take ownership of the inventory.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P67_S7	Also, our ability to control the quality of products produced by contract manufacturers may be limited and quality issues may not be resolved in a timely manner, which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P68_S0	If we fail to effectively manage our growth or, alternatively, our spending during downturns, our business could be disrupted, which could harm our operating results.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P69_S0	The growth in sales, combined with the challenges of managing geographically dispersed operations, can place a significant strain on our management systems and resources, and our anticipated growth in future operations could continue to place such a strain.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P69_S1	The failure to effectively manage our growth could disrupt our business and harm our operating results.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P69_S2	Our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in evolving markets requires an effective planning and management process.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P69_S3	In economic downturns, we must effectively manage our spending and operations to ensure our competitive position during the downturn, as well as our future opportunities when the economy improves, remain intact.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P69_S4	The failure to effectively manage our spending and operations could disrupt our business and harm our operating results.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Historically, acquisitions have been an important element of our strategy.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P70_S1	However, we may not find suitable acquisition candidates in the future and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P70_S2	Any acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P71_S0	We have in the past made strategic acquisitions of other corporations and entities, as well as asset purchases, and we continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions of complementary companies, products and technologies.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P71_S1	In the event of any future acquisitions, we could:
21510_11_ITEM1A_P72_S0	incur expenses related to impairment of goodwill and amortization.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Acquisitions also involve numerous risks, including:
21510_11_ITEM1A_P74_S0	the failure to complete acquisitions even after signing definitive agreements which, among other things, would result in the expensing of potentially significant professional fees and other charges in the period in which the acquisition or negotiations are terminated.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P75_S0	We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify appropriate acquisition candidates, to integrate any businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future or achieve the anticipated benefits of such transactions, which may harm our business.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We use standard laboratory and manufacturing materials that could be considered hazardous and we could be liable for any damage or liability resulting from accidental environmental contamination or injury.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Although most of our products do not incorporate hazardous or toxic materials and chemicals, some of the gases used in our excimer lasers and some of the liquid dyes used in some of our scientific laser products are highly toxic.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P77_S1	In addition, our operations involve the use of standard laboratory and manufacturing materials that could be considered hazardous.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P77_S2	Also, if a facility fire were to occur at our Sunnyvale, California site and were to spread to a reactor used to grow semiconductor wafers, it could release highly toxic emissions.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P77_S3	We believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with all federal, state and offshore regulations and standards.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P77_S4	However, the risk of accidental environmental contamination or injury from such materials cannot be entirely eliminated.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P77_S5	In the event of such an accident involving such materials, we could be liable for damages and such liability could exceed the amount of our liability insurance coverage and the resources of our business which could have an adverse effect on our financial results or our business as a whole.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Compliance or the failure to comply with current and future environmental regulations could cause us significant expense.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P79_S0	We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process or requiring design changes or recycling of products we manufacture.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P79_S1	If we fail to comply with any present and future regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities, the suspension of production or a prohibition on the sale of products we manufacture.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P79_S2	In addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment, or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations, including expenses associated with the recall of any non-compliant product and the management of historical waste.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P80_S0	From time to time new regulations are enacted, and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P80_S1	We continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P80_S2	These regulations include, for example, the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical substances ( REACH ), the Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive ( RoHS ) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive ( WEEE ) enacted in the European Union which regulate the use of certain hazardous substances in, and require the collection, reuse and recycling of waste from, certain products we manufacture.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P80_S3	This and similar legislation that has been or is in the process of being enacted in Japan, China, Korea and various states of the United States may require us to re-design our products to ensure compliance with the applicable standards, for example by requiring the use of different types of materials.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P80_S4	These redesigns or alternative materials may detrimentally impact the performance of our products, add greater testing lead-times for product introductions or have other similar effects.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P80_S5	We believe we comply with all such legislation where our products are sold and we will continue to monitor these laws and the regulations being adopted under them to determine our responsibilities.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P80_S6	In addition, we are monitoring legislation relating to the reduction of carbon emissions from industrial operations to determine whether we may be required to incur any additional material costs or expenses associated with our operations.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Our failure to comply with any of the foregoing regulatory requirements or contractual obligations could result in our being directly or indirectly liable for costs, fines or penalties and third-party claims, and could jeopardize our ability to conduct business in the United States and foreign countries.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Our operations would be seriously harmed if our logistics or facilities or those of our suppliers, our customers' suppliers or our contract manufacturers were to experience catastrophic loss.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Our operations, logistics and facilities and those of our suppliers and contract manufacturers could be subject to a catastrophic loss from fire, flood, earthquake, volcanic eruption, work stoppages, power outages, acts of war, pandemic illnesses, energy shortages, theft of assets, other natural disasters or terrorist activity, such as the recent flooding in Thailand.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P83_S1	A substantial portion of our research and development activities, manufacturing, our corporate headquarters and other critical business operations are located near major earthquake faults in Santa Clara, California, an area with a history of seismic events.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P83_S2	Any such loss or detrimental impact to any of our operations, logistics or facilities could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P83_S3	While we have obtained insurance to cover most potential losses, after reviewing the costs and limitations associated with earthquake insurance, we have decided not to procure such insurance.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P83_S4	We believe that this decision is consistent with decisions reached by numerous other companies located nearby.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P83_S5	We cannot assure you that our existing insurance coverage will be adequate against all other possible losses.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P83_S6	Difficulties with our enterprise resource planning ( ERP ) system and other parts of our global information technology system could harm our business and results of operation.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P83_S7	If our network security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer's data or our data or our information technology systems, we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Like many modern multinational corporations, we maintain a global information technology system, including software products licensed from third parties.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P84_S1	Any system, network or Internet failures, misuse by system users, the hacking into or disruption caused by the unauthorized access by third parties or loss of license rights could disrupt our ability to timely and accurately manufacture and ship products or to report our financial information in compliance with the timelines mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P84_S2	Any such failure, misuse, hacking, disruptions or loss would likely cause a diversion of management's attention from the underlying business and could harm our operations.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P84_S3	In addition, a significant failure of our global information technology system could adversely affect our ability to complete an evaluation of our internal controls and attestation activities pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P85_S0	As part of our day-to-day business, we store our data and certain data about our customers in our global information technology system.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P85_S1	While our system is designed with access security, if a third party gain unauthorized access to our data, including any regarding our customers, such security breach could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, loss of business, litigation and possible liability.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P85_S2	These security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P85_S3	Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers' data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P85_S4	Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P85_S5	Any security breach could result in a loss of confidence by our customers, damage our reputation, disrupt our business, lead to legal liability and negatively impact our future sales.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Changes in tax rates, tax liabilities or tax accounting rules could affect future results.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P87_S0	As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries and jurisdictions.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P87_S1	Significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P87_S2	Our future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries or states with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in the tax laws.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P87_S3	In addition, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) and other tax authorities.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P88_S0	From time to time the United States, foreign and state governments make substantive changes to tax rules and the application of rules to companies, including the recent announcement from the United States government potentially impacting our ability to defer taxes on international earnings.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P88_S1	We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P88_S2	Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Federal securities laws, rules and regulations, as well as the rules and regulations of self-regulatory organizations such as NASDAQ and the NYSE, require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures, impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements, set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers, chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P89_S1	These laws, rules and regulations have increased and will continue to increase the scope, complexity and cost of our corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices, which could harm our results of operations and divert management's attention from business operations.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P90_S1	New or changed laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P90_S2	As a result, their application in practice may evolve over time.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P91_S0	We are committed to maintaining high standards of ethics, corporate governance and public disclosure.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P91_S1	Complying with evolving interpretations of new or changed legal requirements may cause us to incur higher costs as we revise current practices, policies and procedures, and may divert management time and attention from revenue generating to compliance activities.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P91_S2	If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, our reputation may also be harmed.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Governmental regulations, including duties, affecting the import or export of products could negatively affect our revenues.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P93_S0	The United States and many foreign governments impose tariffs and duties on the import and export of products, including some of those which we sell.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P93_S1	In particular, given our worldwide operations, we pay duties on certain products when they are imported into the United States for repair work as well as on certain of our products which are manufactured by our foreign subsidiaries.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P93_S2	These products can be subject to a duty on the product value.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P93_S3	Additionally, the United States and various foreign governments have imposed tariffs, controls, export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies, especially encryption technology.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P93_S4	From time to time, government agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology, such as requiring the escrow and governmental recovery of private encryption keys.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P93_S5	Governmental regulation of encryption technology and regulation of imports or exports, or our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products, could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P93_S6	From time to time our duty calculations and payments are audited by government agencies.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P94_S0	In addition, compliance with the directives of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls ( DDTC ) may result in substantial expenses and diversion of management.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P94_S1	Any failure to adequately address the directives of DDTC could result in civil fines or suspension or loss of our export privileges, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Our market is unpredictable and characterized by rapid technological changes and evolving standards demanding a significant investment in research and development, and, if we fail to address changing market conditions, our business and operating results will be harmed.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P96_S0	The photonics industry is characterized by extensive research and development, rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P96_S1	Because this industry is subject to rapid change, it is difficult to predict its potential size or future growth rate.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P96_S2	Our success in generating revenues in this industry will depend on, among other things:
21510_11_ITEM1A_P97_S0	our ability to accurately predict and develop our products to meet industry standards.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P98_S0	For our fiscal years 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , our research and development costs were $81.2 million ( 10.1% of net sales), $72.4 million ( 12.0% of net sales) and $61.4 million ( 14.1% of net sales), respectively.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P98_S1	We cannot assure you that our expenditures for research and development will result in the introduction of new products or, if such products are introduced, that those products will achieve sufficient market acceptance or to generate sales to offset the costs of development.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P98_S2	Our failure to address rapid technological changes in our markets could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P99_S0	negative impact on our business and results of operations.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P100_S0	The microelectronics market is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product introductions, the volatility of product supply and demand (particularly in the semiconductor industry), changing customer requirements and evolving industry standards.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P100_S1	The nature of this market requires significant research and development expenses to participate, with substantial resources invested in advance of material sales of our products to our customers in this market.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P100_S2	In the event either our customers' or our products fail to gain market acceptance, or the microelectronics market fails to grow, it would likely have a significant negative effect on our business and results of operations.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Continued volatility in the semiconductor manufacturing industry could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P102_S0	A portion of our net sales in the microelectronics market depend on the demand for our products by semiconductor equipment companies.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P103_S0	The semiconductor market has historically been characterized by sudden and severe cyclical variations in product supply and demand, which have often severely affected the demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment, including laser-based tools and systems.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P103_S1	The timing, severity and duration of these market cycles are difficult to predict, and we may not be able to respond effectively to these cycles.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P103_S2	The continuing uncertainty in this market severely limits our ability to predict our business prospects or financial results in this market.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P104_S0	During industry downturns, our revenues from this market may decline suddenly and significantly.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P104_S1	Our ability to rapidly and effectively reduce our cost structure in response to such downturns is limited by the fixed nature of many of our expenses in the near term and by our need to continue our investment in next-generation product technology and to support and service our products.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P104_S2	In addition, due to the relatively long manufacturing lead times for some of the systems and subsystems we sell to this market, we may incur expenditures or purchase raw materials or components for products we cannot sell.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P104_S3	Accordingly, downturns in the semiconductor capital equipment market may materially harm our operating results.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P104_S4	Conversely, when upturns in this market occur, we must be able to rapidly and effectively increase our manufacturing capacity to meet increases in customer demand that may be extremely rapid, and if we fail to do so we may lose business to our competitors and our relationships with our customers may be harmed.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Failure to maintain effective internal controls may cause a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements or to cause us to delay filing our periodic reports with the SEC and adversely affect our stock price.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P106_S0	The SEC, as directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on Form 10-K that contain an assessment by management of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P106_S1	In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P106_S2	Although we test our internal control over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with the Section 404 requirements, our failure to maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements or a delay in our ability to timely file our periodic reports with the SEC, which ultimately could negatively impact our stock price.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P107_S0	Provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law, and our Change-of-Control Severance Plan may have anti-takeover effects that could prevent or delay a change in control.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P108_S0	Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition or make removal of incumbent directors or officers more difficult.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P108_S1	These provisions may discourage takeover attempts and bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P109_S0	establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P110_S0	We are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a merger, asset or stock sale or other transaction with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date such person became an interested stockholder, unless prior approval of our board of directors is obtained or as otherwise provided.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P111_S0	acquiring or merging with us without obtaining the prior approval of our board of directors, which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P111_S1	In addition, we have adopted a change of control severance plan, which provides for the payment of a cash severance benefit to each eligible employee based on the employee's position.
21510_11_ITEM1A_P111_S2	If a change of control occurs, our successor or acquirer will be required to assume and agree to perform all of our obligations under the change of control severance plan which may discourage potential acquirors or result in a lower stock price.

21510_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	Derivative Lawsuits Between February 15, 2007 and March 2, 2007, three purported shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against certain of the Company's current and former officers and directors.
21510_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	The Company is named as a nominal defendant.
21510_11_ITEM3_P0_S2	The complaints generally allege that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties and violated the securities laws in connection with the granting of stock options, the accounting treatment for such grants, the issuance of allegedly misleading public statements and stock sales by certain of the individual defendants.
21510_11_ITEM3_P0_S3	On May 30, 2007, these lawsuits were consolidated under the caption In re Coherent, Inc.
21510_11_ITEM3_P0_S4	Shareholder Derivative Litigation, Lead Case No. C-07-0955-JF (N.D. Cal.).
21510_11_ITEM3_P0_S5	On June 25, 2007, plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint.
21510_11_ITEM3_P0_S6	The consolidated complaint asserts causes of action for alleged violations of federal securities laws, violations of California securities laws, breaches of fiduciary duty and/or aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, constructive fraud, corporate waste, unjust enrichment, insider selling and misappropriation of information.
21510_11_ITEM3_P0_S7	The consolidated complaint seeks, among other relief, disgorgement and damages in an unspecified amount, an accounting, rescission of allegedly improper stock option grants, punitive damages and attorneys' fees and costs.
21510_11_ITEM3_P1_S0	The Company's Board of Directors appointed a Special Litigation Committee ("SLC") comprised of independent director Sandeep Vij to investigate and evaluate the claims asserted in the derivative litigation and to determine what action(s) should be taken with respect to the derivative litigation.
21510_11_ITEM3_P1_S1	On September 8, 2009, Coherent, Inc., by and through the SLC, plaintiffs, and certain of Coherent's former and current officers and directors filed with the court a Stipulation of Settlement reflecting the terms of a settlement that would resolve all claims alleged in the consolidated complaint.
21510_11_ITEM3_P1_S2	The terms of the settlement include a financial benefit to Coherent of over $6 million, which is comprised of a cash payment of $5.25 million to the Company and the waiver by certain former officers and directors of potential claims relating to expired stock options valued at $762,305.
21510_11_ITEM3_P1_S3	The settlement terms also include the implementation and/or agreement to maintain certain corporate governance changes, and a payment by the Company to plaintiffs' counsel of $3 million in attorneys' fees and expenses.
21510_11_ITEM3_P1_S4	On September 14, 2009, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California issued an order granting preliminary approval of the settlement.
21510_11_ITEM3_P1_S5	On November 20, 2009, the court held a hearing for final approval of the settlement, and on November 24, 2009, the court entered an Order and Final Judgment, which approved the settlement and dismissed the action with prejudice.
21510_11_ITEM3_P1_S6	Coherent received the cash payment of $2.25 million on December 11, 2009.
21510_11_ITEM3_P2_S0	Income Tax Audits We are subject to taxation and file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions.
21510_11_ITEM3_P2_S1	For U.S. federal income tax purposes, all years prior to 2005 are closed.
21510_11_ITEM3_P3_S0	The IRS audited the research and development credits generated in the years 1999 through 2001 and carried forward to future years.
21510_11_ITEM3_P3_S1	We received a notice of proposed adjustment ( NOPA ) from the IRS in October 2008 to decrease the amount of research and development credits generated in years 2000 and 2001.
21510_11_ITEM3_P3_S2	We signed a Closing Agreement with the IRS which allows additional research and development credits for the years 2000 and 2001, respectively.
21510_11_ITEM3_P3_S3	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Joint Committee on Taxation approved this agreement.
21510_11_ITEM3_P3_S4	We provided adequate tax reserves for adjustments to these research and development credits for the years 2000 and 2001.
21510_11_ITEM3_P3_S5	This settlement resulted in the closure of U.S. federal statutes of limitations for years through 2004 and we released net unrecognized tax benefits under ASC 740-10 and related interest of approximately $9.7 million that affected the Company's effective tax rate for fiscal year 2011.
21510_11_ITEM3_P3_S6	In our major state jurisdictions and our major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 2000 and 2004, respectively, currently remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities.
21510_11_ITEM3_P3_S7	We believe that we have provided adequate reserves for any adjustments that may be determined by the tax authorities.
21510_11_ITEM3_P3_S8	Management believes that it has adequately provided for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.
21510_11_ITEM3_P4_S0	The Company regularly engages in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions.
21510_11_ITEM3_P4_S1	It is reasonably possible that certain federal, foreign and state tax matters may be concluded in the next 12 months.
21510_11_ITEM3_P4_S2	The Company estimates that the net unrecognized tax benefits and related interest at October 1, 2011 could be reduced by approximately $1.0 million to $2.0 million in the next 12 months.
21510_11_ITEM5_P0_S0	The number of stockholders of record as of November 25, 2011 was 1,010.
21510_11_ITEM5_P0_S1	No cash dividends have been declared or paid since Coherent was founded and we have no present intention to declare or pay cash dividends.
21510_11_ITEM5_P0_S2	There were no sales of unregistered securities in fiscal 2011.
21510_11_ITEM5_P1_S0	Stock repurchases during the three months ended October 1, 2011 were as follows:
21510_11_ITEM5_P2_S0	(1) On January 26, 2011, we announced that the Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $75.0 million of our common stock.
21510_11_ITEM5_P2_S1	The timing and size of any purchases will be subject to market conditions.
21510_11_ITEM5_P2_S2	The program was completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
21510_11_ITEM5_P2_S3	(2) On August 25, 2011, we announced that the Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $50.0 million of our common stock.
21510_11_ITEM5_P2_S4	The program is authorized for 12 months from the date of authorization.
21510_11_ITEM5_P2_S5	The timing and size of any purchases will be subject to market conditions.
21510_11_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following graph shows a five-year comparison of cumulative total stockholder return, calculated on a dividend reinvestment basis and based on a $100 investment, from September 30, 2006 through October 1, 2011 comparing the return on our common stock with the Russell 2000 Index, the Standard and Poors Technology Index and the Nasdaq Composite Index.
21510_11_ITEM5_P3_S1	No dividends have been declared or paid on our common stock during such period.

21510_11_ITEM6_P0_S0	We derived the selected consolidated financial data as of fiscal 2011 and 2010 year-end and for fiscal 2011 , 2010 and 2009 from our audited consolidated financial statements, and accompanying notes, contained in this annual report.
21510_11_ITEM6_P0_S1	The consolidated statements of operations data for fiscal 2008 and 2007 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 year-end are derived from our consolidated financial statements which are not included in this report.
21510_11_ITEM6_P1_S0	(1) Includes a gain of $6.1 million after tax related to the dissolution of our Finland operations, a $9.7 million tax benefit from the release of tax reserves and related interest as a result of an IRS settlement and the closure of open tax years and a $1.5 million tax charge due to an increase in valuation allowances against deferred tax assets.
21510_11_ITEM6_P1_S1	(2) Includes restructuring expenses of $5.8 million after tax primarily related to the closure of our Finland site and the consolidation of our Montreal, Canada site under the management of our Wilsonville, Oregon site and a net benefit after tax of $1.4 million related to a receipt from the settlement of litigation resulting from our internal stock option investigation.
21510_11_ITEM6_P1_S2	(3) Includes $19.3 million in after-tax expense related to the impairment of goodwill, restructuring expenses of $11.5 million after tax primarily related to the consolidation of our Munich site into our Gottingen and Lubeck, Germany sites and our Finland site, the exit of our Auburn, California facility, the exit of our St. Louis, Missouri facility and headcount reductions due to the evolving global economic conditions, $0.8 million in after-tax costs related to our stock option investigation and litigation and a tax charge of $3.8 million composed of the impact of a recently enacted change in state tax law and a valuation allowance in one of our European subsidiaries.
21510_11_ITEM6_P1_S3	(4) Includes $5.5 million in after-tax costs related to our stock option investigation and litigation, restructuring expenses of $3.9 million after-tax related to the exit of our Auburn, California facility, the consolidation of our German DPSS manufacturing into one location in Germany and headcount reductions due to the evolving global economic situation, and a tax charge of $1.4 million in connection with a dividend from one of our European subsidiaries.
21510_11_ITEM6_P1_S4	(5) Includes a $12.6 million loss on our sale of our Auburn campus in Auburn, California, $7.0 million in after-tax costs related to our stock option investigation and litigation, a $2.6 million after-tax charge to write off unamortized capitalized deferred issuance costs associated with our repayment of our convertible subordinated notes, a charge of $2.2 million for in-process research and development ("IPR D") related to our purchase of Nuvonyx, $0.2 million after-tax costs related to the termination of the Excel merger agreement, a $3.6 million capital gain on the sale of our Condensa building in Santa Clara, California, and a $0.7 million after-tax gain from the sale of substantially all of the net assets of our Coherent Imaging Optics Limited (COIL) subsidiary to CVI Laser.
21510_11_ITEM6_P2_S0	(6) See Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies" in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for an explanation of the determination of the number of shares used in computing net income (loss) per share.
21510_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following is a summary of some of the quantitative performance indicators (as defined below) that may be used to assess our results of operations and financial condition:
21510_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	Definitions and analysis of these performance indicators are as follows: Bookings and Book-to-Bill Ratio Bookings represent orders expected to be shipped within 12 months and services to be provided pursuant to service contracts.
21510_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	While we generally have not experienced a significant rate of cancellation, bookings are generally cancelable by our customers without substantial penalty and, therefore, we cannot assure all bookings will be converted to net sales.
21510_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	The book-to-bill ratio is calculated as annual bookings divided by annual net sales.
21510_11_ITEM7_P2_S1	This is an indication of the strength of our business but can sometimes be impacted by a single large order.
21510_11_ITEM7_P2_S2	A ratio greater than 1.0 indicating that demand for our products is greater than what we supply in the year.
21510_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	Fiscal 2011 bookings reached another new record for the Company.

21510_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	Net Sales Net sales include sales of lasers, laser tools, related accessories and service contracts.
21510_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	Net sales for fiscal 2011 increased 32.7% from fiscal 2010 .
21510_11_ITEM7_P17_S2	Net sales for fiscal 2010 increased 38.8% from fiscal 2009.
21510_11_ITEM7_P17_S3	For a description of the reasons for changes in net sales refer to the "Results of Operations" section below.
21510_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	Gross Profit as a Percentage of Net Sales Gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit percentage") is calculated as gross profit for the period divided by net sales for the period.
21510_11_ITEM7_P18_S1	Gross profit percentage for CLC increased to 41.1% in fiscal 2011 from 36.2% in fiscal 2010 and from 26.4% in fiscal 2009 .
21510_11_ITEM7_P18_S2	Gross profit percentage for SLS decreased to 45.4% in fiscal 2011 from 47.0% in fiscal 2010 and increased from 41.4% in fiscal 2009 .
21510_11_ITEM7_P18_S3	For a description of the reasons for changes in gross profit refer to the "Results of Operations" section below.
21510_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	Research and Development as a Percentage of Net Sales Research and development as a percentage of net sales ("R D percentage") is calculated as research and development expense for the period divided by net sales for the period.
21510_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	Management considers R D percentage to be an important indicator in managing our business as investing in new technologies is a key to future growth.
21510_11_ITEM7_P19_S2	R D percentage decreased to 10.1% from 12.0% in fiscal 2010 and 14.1% in fiscal 2009 .
21510_11_ITEM7_P19_S3	R D percentage decreased primarily due to higher sales volumes, partially offset by higher project development spending.
21510_11_ITEM7_P19_S4	For a description of the reasons for changes in R D spending refer to the "Results of Operations" section below.
21510_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows primarily represents the excess of cash collected from billings to our customers and other receipts over cash paid to our vendors for expenses and inventory purchases to run our business.
21510_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	We believe that cash flows from operations is an important performance indicator because cash generation over the long term is essential to maintaining a healthy business and providing funds to help fuel growth.
21510_11_ITEM7_P20_S2	For a description of the reasons for changes in Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities refer to the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section below.
21510_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	Days Sales Outstanding in Receivables We calculate days sales outstanding ("DSO") in receivables as net receivables at the end of the period divided by net sales during the period and then multiplied by the number of days in the period, using 360 days for years.
21510_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	DSO in receivables indicates how well we are managing our collection of receivables, with lower DSO in receivables resulting in higher working capital availability.
21510_11_ITEM7_P21_S2	The more money we have tied up in receivables, the less money we have available for research and development, acquisitions, expansion, marketing and other activities to grow our business.
21510_11_ITEM7_P21_S3	Our DSO in receivables for fiscal 2011 decreased 2.4 days from fiscal 2010 to 63.2 days.
21510_11_ITEM7_P21_S4	The decrease in DSO in receivables is primarily due to the higher mix of revenue and related receivables in Asia (excluding Japan) where the DSO is lower than the average DSO for the Company taken as a whole as well as due to the improved DSO in Europe due to faster collections.
21510_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	We calculate annualized inventory turns as cost of sales during the fourth quarter annualized and divided by net inventories at the end of the fourth quarter.
21510_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	This indicates how well we are managing our inventory levels, with higher inventory turns resulting in more working capital availability and a higher return on our investments in inventory.
21510_11_ITEM7_P22_S2	The more money we have tied up in inventory, the less money we have available for research and development, acquisitions, expansion, marketing and other activities to grow our business.
21510_11_ITEM7_P22_S3	Our annualized inventory turns for fiscal 2011 decreased 0.3 days from fiscal 2010 to 3.1 days.
21510_11_ITEM7_P22_S4	The deterioration in inventory turns is primarily due to increased inventory levels to support increased volumes.
21510_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	Capital Spending as a Percentage of Net Sales Capital spending as a percentage of net sales ("capital spending percentage") is calculated as capital expenditures for the period divided by net sales for the period.
21510_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	Capital spending percentage indicates the extent to which we are expanding or improving our operations, including investments in technology.
21510_11_ITEM7_P23_S2	Management monitors capital spending levels as this assists management in measuring our cash flows, net of capital expenditures.
21510_11_ITEM7_P23_S3	Our capital spending percentage increased from 2.5% in fiscal 2010 to 4.6% in fiscal 2011 and decreased from 5.0% in fiscal 2009 to 2.5% in fiscal 2010 .
21510_11_ITEM7_P23_S4	The fiscal 2011 increase was primarily due to purchases of production-related assets and building improvements to support higher sales volumes.
21510_11_ITEM7_P23_S5	The fiscal 2010 decrease was primarily due to higher sales volumes in fiscal 2010 net of fiscal 2009 spending for the purchase of assets in support of a more effective business model for our semiconductor business and building investments related to our facilities consolidation and relocation programs.
21510_11_ITEM7_P23_S6	We expect capital spending for fiscal 2012 to be approximately 4.5% of net sales including substantial investments in Germany and South Korea.
21510_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	During the first quarter of fiscal 2009 our stock price declined substantially, which combined with expectations of declines in forecasted operating results due to the slowdown in the global economy, led us to conclude that a triggering event for review for potential goodwill impairment had occurred.
21510_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	Accordingly, as of December 27, 2008, we performed an interim goodwill impairment evaluation.
21510_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	The performance of this test is a two-step process.
21510_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	Management reviewed the results of the Step 1 analysis and concluded that a Step 2 analysis was required only for the CLC reporting unit.
21510_11_ITEM7_P25_S2	Our analysis indicated that the entire balance of the goodwill in the CLC reporting unit at that date was impaired and we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $19.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2009.
21510_11_ITEM7_P25_S3	The estimated fair value of our SLS reporting unit exceeded its carrying value so no further impairment analysis was required for this reporting unit.
21510_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	Restructuring Activities In fiscal 2009, we initiated the planning phase of a multiyear project, with a targeted completion date of September 2010, to exit our epitaxial growth facility in Tampere, Finland and establish enhanced capabilities in Sunnyvale, California.
21510_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	We decided to delay the closure due to increased demand for our products manufactured in Finland and we exited the facility in the third quarter of fiscal 2011.
21510_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we ceased manufacturing operations in our Finland facility and recognized a $6.1 million gain, primarily in other income (expense), due to a non-recurring translation adjustment related to the dissolution of our Finland operations.
21510_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	We completed the consolidation of the remainder of our Munich facility into our G ttingen site during third quarter of fiscal 2009.
21510_11_ITEM7_P27_S2	During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we substantially completed the transition of our optics manufacturing assets from Auburn, California to REO, and announced that we would be exiting our facility in St. Louis, Missouri.
21510_11_ITEM7_P27_S3	We completed the exit from St. Louis, Missouri in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.

21510_11_ITEM7_P43_S6	Our gross profit rate increased by 6.1% to 43.1% in fiscal 2010 from 37.0% in fiscal 2009 primarily due to higher sales volumes and a lower manufacturing cost structure as well as lower restructuring costs.
21510_11_ITEM7_P43_S7	The improvement includes lower other costs primarily due to lower need for inventory provisions for excess and obsolete items (2.3%), the benefit of a lower manufacturing cost structure (1.8%), lower restructuring costs (1.4%) and lower warranty and installation costs (0.7%) due to the benefit of increasing volumes net of the cost resulting from replacement of non-compliant vendor components.
21510_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	Our gross profit rate has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors including market mix, pricing on volume orders, manufacturing efficiencies, excess and obsolete inventory write-downs, warranty costs, pricing by competitors or suppliers, new product introductions, production volume, customization and reconfiguration of systems, commodity prices and foreign currency fluctuations.
21510_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	Commercial Lasers and Components Our CLC gross profit rate increased by 4.9% to 41.1% in fiscal 2011 from 36.2% in fiscal 2010 primarily due to favorable product costs (2.4%) due to the impact of increased volumes and favorable product mix within the microelectronics market, lower restructuring costs (2.2%) and lower other costs (0.6%) due to lower inventory provisions partially offset by higher warranty costs (0.3%).
21510_11_ITEM7_P44_S2	Our CLC gross profit rate increased by 9.8% to 36.2% in fiscal 2010 from 26.4% in fiscal 2009 primarily due to lower other costs (4.3%) primarily due to lower need for inventory provisions and the impact of higher sales volumes, lower restructuring costs (1.9%), the impact of increased volumes and cost reduction efforts (1.9%) and lower warranty and installation costs (1.6%) due to the benefit of increasing volumes net of the cost resulting from replacement of non-compliant vendor components.
21510_11_ITEM7_P44_S3	Our SLS gross profit rate decreased by 1.6% to 45.4% in fiscal 2011 from 47.0% in fiscal 2010 primarily due to unfavorable product costs (0.8%) resulting from unfavorable mix within the microelectronics market and the acquisition of Hypertronics net of the impact of increased volumes and cost reduction efforts as well as higher other costs (1.0%) due to higher inventory provisions and higher freight costs partially offset by lower warranty costs (0.2%).
21510_11_ITEM7_P44_S4	Our SLS gross profit rate increased by 5.6% to 47.0% in fiscal 2010 from 41.4% in fiscal 2009 primarily due to the impact of increased volumes and cost reduction efforts as well as favorable product mix in the microelectronics and solar markets (2.5%), lower other costs (1.7%) due to lower need for inventory provisions and the impact of higher sales volumes and lower restructuring costs (1.3%).
21510_11_ITEM7_P44_S5	Although warranty and installation costs as a percentage of net sales were flat, the benefit of increasing volumes was offset by the cost resulting from replacement of non-compliant vendor components.
21510_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	Research and development Fiscal 2011 research and development ("R D") expenses increased $8.9 million , or 12% , from fiscal 2010 .
21510_11_ITEM7_P45_S1	The increase was due primarily to higher payroll spending ($7.0 million) due to increased headcount and higher performance-related compensation and the acquisitions of Hypertronics in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 and Beam Dynamics in the middle of the third quarter of fiscal 2010 ($2.3 million).
21510_11_ITEM7_P45_S2	As a percentage of sales, the decrease was primarily due to increased sales volumes.
21510_11_ITEM7_P45_S3	On a segment basis, CLC spending increased $1.9 million primarily due to higher payroll spending and the acquisition of Beam Dynamics in the middle of the third quarter of fiscal 2010 partially offset by lower project spending and lower restructuring costs.
21510_11_ITEM7_P45_S4	SLS spending increased $5.9 million primarily due to higher payroll spending, the acquisition of Hypertronics in the second quarter of fiscal 2011, higher project spending and the impact of foreign exchange rates.
21510_11_ITEM7_P45_S5	Corporate and other spending increased $1.1 million.
21510_11_ITEM7_P45_S6	Fiscal 2010 R D expenses increased $10.9 million, or 18%, from fiscal 2009.
21510_11_ITEM7_P45_S7	The increase was primarily due to higher payroll spending ($4.2 million) due to higher performance-related compensation net of lower severance-related restructuring costs and the elimination of mandatory time off, higher project spending ($3.6 million), the acquisition of certain product lines from StockerYale in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and Beam Dynamics in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 ($2.6 million), higher charges for increases in deferred compensation plan liabilities ($0.7 million) with the related earnings for increases in deferred compensation plan assets recorded in other income (expense), $0.3 million higher stock-related compensation expense and higher other spending ($0.2 million) partially offset by lower non-severance related restructuring costs ($0.7 million).
21510_11_ITEM7_P45_S8	On a segment basis, CLC spending increased $6.4 million primarily due to higher project spending including higher payroll and bonus spending as well as the acquisition of StockerYale.
21510_11_ITEM7_P45_S9	SLS spending increased $2.5 million primarily due to higher payroll and bonus spending partially offset by lower restructuring costs.
21510_11_ITEM7_P45_S10	Corporate and other spending increased $2.0 million.
21510_11_ITEM7_P45_S11	Selling, general and administrative Fiscal 2011 selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses increased $25.9 million , or 21% , from fiscal 2010 .
21510_11_ITEM7_P45_S12	The increase was primarily due to $12.3 million higher payroll spending due to higher performance-related compensation spending, higher headcount and increased salaries, $4.9 million higher other variable spending, $3.8 million higher stock-related compensation expense, the acquisitions of Hypertronics in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 and Beam Dynamics in the middle of the third quarter of fiscal 2010 ($2.2 million), the impact of foreign currency exchange rates ($1.8 million) and higher charges for increases in deferred compensation plan liabilities ($0.9 million) with the related earnings for increases in deferred compensation plan assets recorded in other income (expense) partially offset by lower restructuring costs ($2.2 million).

21510_11_ITEM7_P45_S16	Spending for Corporate and other increased $9.8 million primarily due to higher stock-related compensation expense, the net receipt from the settlement of litigation resulting from our stock option investigation in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, higher payroll spending, higher charges for increases in deferred compensation plan liabilities and higher other variable spending.
21510_11_ITEM7_P45_S17	Fiscal 2010 SG A expenses increased $15.5 million, or 14%, from fiscal 2009.
21510_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	rates ($0.6 million) partially offset by $3.3 million lower costs incurred for litigation resulting from our internal stock option investigation primarily due to a receipt from the settlement of the litigation and $2.0 million lower spending on facilities due to site consolidations.
21510_11_ITEM7_P46_S1	On a segment basis, CLC spending increased $6.1 million primarily due to higher payroll spending and the acquisition of certain product lines from StockerYale.
21510_11_ITEM7_P46_S2	SLS segment expenses increased $3.0 million primarily due to higher payroll spending net of savings from site consolidations.
21510_11_ITEM7_P46_S3	Spending for Corporate and other increased $6.4 million primarily due to higher charges due to increases in deferred compensation plan liabilities and higher performance-related compensation spending partially offset by lower costs incurred for litigation resulting from our internal stock option investigation.
21510_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	Impairment of goodwill Under generally accepted accounting principles, goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and written down when impaired.
21510_11_ITEM7_P47_S1	During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, our stock price declined substantially, which combined with expectations of declines in forecasted operating results due to the slowdown in the global economy, led the Company to conclude that a triggering event for review for potential goodwill impairment had occurred.
21510_11_ITEM7_P47_S2	Accordingly, as of December 27, 2008, we performed an interim goodwill impairment evaluation which indicated that the goodwill was fully impaired.
21510_11_ITEM7_P47_S3	We recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $19.3 million in the CLC reporting unit in the first quarter of fiscal 2009.
21510_11_ITEM7_P47_S4	Amortization of intangible assets Amortization of intangible assets increased $0.1 million , or 1% , from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 primarily due to the amortization of intangibles from the acquisition of Hypertronics in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 and Beam Dynamics in the third quarter of fiscal 2010, partially offset by completion of amortization of certain intangibles related to prior acquisitions.
21510_11_ITEM7_P47_S5	Amortization of intangible assets increased $0.5 million, or 7%, from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 primarily due to the acquisition of certain product lines from StockerYale and the acquisition of Beam Dynamics partially offset by completion of amortization of certain intangibles related to prior acquisitions.
21510_11_ITEM7_P47_S6	Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net, increased $10.7 million from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 .
21510_11_ITEM7_P47_S7	The increase was primarily due to the $6.5 million non-recurring translation adjustment related to the dissolution of our Finland operations, higher net foreign currency exchange gains ($2.9 million) and higher gains on our deferred compensation plan assets net of expenses ($2.4 million) including a $1.5 million death benefit, partially offset by lower interest income ($1.0 million) primarily due to interest on a tax refund in fiscal 2010.
21510_11_ITEM7_P47_S8	Other income (expense), net, increased $1.8 million from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010.
21510_11_ITEM7_P47_S9	The increase was primarily due to the recovery in the market value of our deferred compensation plan assets ($5.1 million) partially offset by lower benefit from Japan consumption tax savings ($2.5 million) as the benefit expired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, lower interest income ($0.6 million) as a result of lower rates of return net of interest on tax refunds and the impact of higher average cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balances and higher foreign currency exchange losses ($0.3 million).
21510_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	Income taxes The effective tax rate on income before income taxes for fiscal 2011 of 24.7% was lower than the statutory rate of 35.0%.
21510_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	This was primarily due to the benefit of releasing unrecognized tax benefits under ASC 740-10 and related interest, the benefit of federal research and development credits, including additional credits reinstated from fiscal 2010 resulting from the enactment of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Jobs Creation Acts of 2010, the benefit of foreign tax credits, the benefit of currency translation adjustments related to closure of Coherent Finland's operations, the benefit from income subject to foreign tax rates that are lower than U.S. tax rates and the benefit from the unrealized gain on life insurance policy investments related to our deferred compensation plans.
21510_11_ITEM7_P48_S2	These amounts are partially offset by state income tax, limitations on the utilization of certain foreign tax attributes and net operating losses, limitations on the deductibility of compensation under IRC Section 162(m), deemed dividend inclusions under the Subpart F tax rules and a currency translation adjustment related to a dividend from a foreign subsidiary.
21510_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	During fiscal 2011, we increased our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by $1.5 million to $8.8 million, primarily due to the reduced ability to utilize foreign tax attributes and net operating losses and the reduced ability to utilize California research and development tax credits as a result of releasing net unrecognized tax benefits under ASC 740-10 that supported the credits.
21510_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	During fiscal 2010, we increased our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets to $7.4 million, primarily due to a capital loss limitation true-up, the reduced ability to utilize California research and development tax credits as a result of the current apportionment factor and the reduced ability to utilize foreign net operating losses.
21510_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	tax credits as a result of new California legislation and the reduced ability to utilize foreign net operating losses.
21510_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	In making the determination to record the valuation allowance, management considered the likelihood of future taxable income and feasible and prudent tax planning strategies to realize deferred tax assets.
21510_11_ITEM7_P51_S1	In the future, if we determine that we expect to realize deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the valuation allowance will affect income in the period such determination is made.
21510_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 ( Act ), was enacted on December 17, 2010.
21510_11_ITEM7_P52_S1	Under the Act, the federal research and development credit was retroactively extended for amounts paid or incurred after December 31, 2009 through December 31, 2011.
21510_11_ITEM7_P52_S2	The effects of the change in the tax law are recognized in our first quarter of fiscal 2011, which is the quarter that the law was enacted.
21510_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	In addition to the federal legislation, the state of California approved its 2010-2011 budget on October 8, 2010 that includes modifications to the tax law provisions that were previously set to become effective with tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2011.
21510_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	Accordingly, we were able to benefit from additional research and development tax credits in fiscal year 2011 that were previously limited.
21510_11_ITEM7_P53_S2	The effective tax rate on income before income taxes for fiscal 2010 of 36.3% was higher than the statutory rate of 35.0%.
21510_11_ITEM7_P53_S3	This was primarily due to stock compensation not deductible for tax purposes and an increase in valuation allowance against capital loss carryforwards, California research and development tax credits as a result of California legislation enacted in February 2009 and certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards.
21510_11_ITEM7_P53_S4	These increases are partially offset by the benefit of income subject to foreign tax rates that are lower than U.S. tax rates and research and development credits.
21510_11_ITEM7_P53_S5	The difference between the statutory rate of 35.0% and our effective tax rate of 1.5% on income (loss) before income taxes for fiscal 2009, which represents a current year benefit, was due primarily to permanent differences related to the non-deductibility of the goodwill impairment charge, an increase in valuation allowance against California research and development tax credits as a result of California legislation enacted in February 2009 and certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards, and deemed dividend inclusions under the Subpart F tax rules.
21510_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity and capital resources At October 1, 2011 , we had assets classified as cash and cash equivalents, as well as time deposits and fixed income securities classified as short-term investments, in an aggregate amount of $220.2 million , compared to $263.4 million at October 2, 2010 .
21510_11_ITEM7_P54_S1	At October 1, 2011 , we held cash and cash equivalents outside the U.S. in certain of our foreign operations totaling approximately $145.1 million, the majority of which is denominated in the Euro.
21510_11_ITEM7_P54_S2	We currently intend to permanently reinvest approximately $134 million of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries.
21510_11_ITEM7_P54_S3	If, however, a portion of these funds were needed for and distributed to our operations in the United States, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes.
21510_11_ITEM7_P54_S4	The amount of taxes due will depend on the amount and manner of repatriation, as well as the location from where the funds are repatriated.
21510_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	We actively monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold these assets, primarily focusing on the safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield on these assets.
21510_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	We diversify our cash and cash equivalents and investments among various financial institutions, money market funds and sovereign debt in order to reduce our exposure should any one of these financial institutions or financial instruments fail or encounter difficulties.
21510_11_ITEM7_P55_S2	To date, we have not experienced any material loss or lack of access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments.
21510_11_ITEM7_P55_S3	However, we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets.
21510_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	Sources and Uses of Cash Historically, our primary source of cash has been provided by operations.
21510_11_ITEM7_P56_S1	Other sources of cash in the past three fiscal years include proceeds received from the sale of our stock through our employee stock option and purchase plans.
21510_11_ITEM7_P56_S2	Our historical uses of cash have primarily been for the repurchase of our common stock, capital expenditures and acquisitions of businesses and technologies.
21510_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $7.9 million in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 and increased by $39.8 million in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 .
21510_11_ITEM7_P57_S1	The increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to higher net income partially offset by lower cash flows from inventories, accounts payable and other current liabilities.
21510_11_ITEM7_P57_S2	The increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to higher net income and lower tax payments due to new tax legislation which allows the carry back of net operating losses for up to five years partially offset by lower cash flows from increased working capital (accounts receivable and inventories, net of increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses) needed to support increased sales and projected sales volumes.
21510_11_ITEM7_P57_S3	We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short term investments combined with cash to be provided by operating activities will be adequate to cover our working capital needs and planned capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months to the extent such items are known or are reasonably determinable based on current business and market conditions.
21510_11_ITEM7_P57_S4	However, we may elect to finance certain of our capital expenditure requirements through borrowings under our bank credit facilities or other sources of capital.
21510_11_ITEM7_P57_S5	We continue to follow our strategy to further strengthen our financial position by using available cash flow to fund operations.
21510_11_ITEM7_P57_S6	We intend to continue pursuing acquisition opportunities at valuations we believe are reasonable based upon market conditions as demonstrated by our acquisition of businesses from Hypertronics in the second quarter of fiscal 2011, Beam Dynamics in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and StockerYale in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.
21510_11_ITEM7_P57_S7	However, we cannot accurately predict the timing, size and success of our acquisition efforts or our associated potential capital commitments.
21510_11_ITEM7_P57_S8	Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire businesses on terms acceptable to us.
21510_11_ITEM7_P57_S9	We expect to fund future acquisitions primarily through existing cash balances and cash flows from operations.
21510_11_ITEM7_P57_S10	If required, we will look for additional borrowings or consider the issuance of securities.
21510_11_ITEM7_P57_S11	The extent to which we will be willing or able to use our common stock to make acquisitions will depend on its market value at the time and the willingness of potential sellers to accept it as full or partial payment.
21510_11_ITEM7_P57_S12	On April 29, 2010 , we announced that the Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $50.0 million of our common stock.
21510_11_ITEM7_P57_S13	During fiscal 2010 , we repurchased and retired 1,195,829 shares of outstanding common stock at an average price of $36.21 per share for a total of $43.3 million , excluding expenses.
21510_11_ITEM7_P57_S14	On January 26, 2011 , we announced that the Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $75.0 million of our common stock.
21510_11_ITEM7_P57_S15	The program was authorized for 12 months from the date of authorization.
21510_11_ITEM7_P57_S16	During fiscal 2011 , we completed the stock repurchase.
21510_11_ITEM7_P57_S17	We repurchased and retired 454,682 shares of outstanding common stock at an average price of $59.00 per share for a total of $26.8 million , excluding expenses.
21510_11_ITEM7_P57_S18	During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2011 , we repurchased and retired 1,024,409 shares of outstanding common stock at an average price of $47.03 per share for a total of $48.2 million , excluding expenses.
21510_11_ITEM7_P57_S19	On August 25, 2011, we announced that the Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $50.0 million of our common stock.
21510_11_ITEM7_P57_S20	The program is authorized for 12 months from the date of authorization.
21510_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	During fiscal 2011, we repurchased and retired 586,200 shares of outstanding common stock at an average price of $42.67 per share for a total of $25.0 million , excluding expenses.
21510_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	At October 1, 2011, $25.0 million remained authorized for repurchase under our repurchase program.
21510_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	During fiscal year 2008, we initiated restructuring plans to decrease costs by consolidating facilities and reducing our workforce.
21510_11_ITEM7_P59_S1	As of October 1, 2011 , we had made payments in connection with the restructuring plans in the amount of $27.7 million .
21510_11_ITEM7_P59_S2	We completed payments for substantially all anticipated costs related to the restructuring plans in the third quarter of fiscal 2011.
21510_11_ITEM7_P59_S3	Additional sources of cash available to us were domestic and international currency lines of credit and bank credit facilities totaling $60.6 million as of October 1, 2011 , of which $58.5 million was unused and available.
21510_11_ITEM7_P59_S4	These unsecured credit facilities were used in Europe during fiscal 2011 as guarantees.
21510_11_ITEM7_P59_S5	Our domestic line of credit includes a $40.0 million unsecured revolving credit account with Union Bank of California, which expires on March 31, 2012 and is subject to covenants related to financial ratios and tangible net worth.
21510_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	used of the international currency lines as of October 1, 2011 .
21510_11_ITEM7_P60_S1	Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 3.6 :1 at October 1, 2011 , compared to 4.1 :1 at October 2, 2010 .
21510_11_ITEM7_P60_S2	The decrease in our ratio is primarily due to decreases in cash and increases in income taxes payable and other current liabilities partially offset by increases in inventories and accounts receivable.
21510_11_ITEM7_P60_S3	Our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash, working capital and debt obligations are as follows (in thousands):
21510_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933.
21510_11_ITEM7_P61_S1	The following summarizes our contractual obligations at October 1, 2011 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):
21510_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	Because of the uncertainty as to the timing of such payments, we have excluded cash payments related to our contractual obligations for our deferred compensation plans aggregating $25.5 million at October 1, 2011 .
21510_11_ITEM7_P62_S1	As of October 1, 2011 , we recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $33.7 million and gross interest and penalties of $3.4 million .
21510_11_ITEM7_P62_S2	As of October 2, 2010 , we recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $50.1 million and gross interest and penalties of $6.9 million .
21510_11_ITEM7_P62_S3	Both gross unrecognized tax benefits and gross interest and penalties are classified as non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
21510_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.
21510_11_ITEM7_P63_S1	As a result, these amounts are not included in the table above.
21510_11_ITEM7_P63_S2	Changes in financial condition Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2011 was $86.7 million , which included net income of $93.2 million , depreciation and amortization of $28.6 million , decreases in net deferred tax assets of $22.1 million due to utilization of tax credits and stock-based compensation expense of $13.0 million partially offset by cash used by operating assets and liabilities of $59.0 million , a non-recurring translation adjustment related to the dissolution of our Finland operations of $6.5 million and $4.7 million other.
21510_11_ITEM7_P63_S3	Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2011 of $85.7 million included $35.4 million net purchases of available-for-sale securities, $36.8 million , net, used to acquire property and equipment and improve buildings and $14.1 million used to acquire Hypertronics partially offset by decreases in restricted cash of $0.6 million .
21510_11_ITEM7_P63_S4	Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2011 was $64.1 million , including $100.6 million used to repurchase our common stock partially offset by $34.7 million generated from our employee stock purchase plans and $1.8 million other.
21510_11_ITEM7_P63_S5	Changes in exchange rates in fiscal 2011 resulted in a decrease in cash balances of $15.2 million .
21510_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 2.
21510_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	Annual Report on Form 10-K for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the respective dates of adoption or expected adoption and effects on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
21510_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.
21510_11_ITEM7_P66_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
21510_11_ITEM7_P66_S2	We have identified the following as the items that require the most significant judgment and often involve complex estimation: revenue recognition, accounting for long-lived assets (including goodwill and intangible assets), inventory valuation, warranty reserves, stock-based compensation and accounting for income taxes.
21510_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered or the service has been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable.
21510_11_ITEM7_P67_S1	Revenue from product sales is recorded when all of the foregoing conditions are met and risk of loss and title passes to the customer.
21510_11_ITEM7_P67_S2	Our products typically include a warranty and the estimated cost of product warranty claims (based on historical experience) is recorded at the time the sale is recognized.
21510_11_ITEM7_P67_S3	Sales to customers are generally not subject to any price protection or return rights.
21510_11_ITEM7_P67_S4	The vast majority of our sales are made to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors, resellers and end-users in the non-scientific market.
21510_11_ITEM7_P67_S5	Sales made to these customers do not require installation of the products by us and are not subject to other post-delivery obligations, except in occasional instances where we have agreed to perform installation or provide training.
21510_11_ITEM7_P67_S6	In those instances, we defer revenue related to installation services or training until these services have been rendered.
21510_11_ITEM7_P67_S7	We allocate revenue from multiple element arrangements to the various elements based upon fair values or a selling price hierarchy, for arrangements entered into subsequent to October 2, 2010, as discussed below.
21510_11_ITEM7_P67_S8	Should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions, revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected.
21510_11_ITEM7_P67_S9	Failure to obtain anticipated orders due to delays or cancellations of orders could have a material adverse effect on our revenue.
21510_11_ITEM7_P67_S10	In addition, pressures from customers to reduce our prices or to modify our existing sales terms may have a material adverse effect on our revenue in future periods.
21510_11_ITEM7_P67_S11	Our sales to distributors, resellers and end-user customers typically do not have customer acceptance provisions and only certain of our sales to OEM customers have customer acceptance provisions.
21510_11_ITEM7_P67_S12	Customer acceptance is generally limited to performance under our published product specifications.
21510_11_ITEM7_P67_S13	For the few product sales that have customer acceptance provisions because of higher than published specifications, (1) the products are tested and accepted by the customer at our site or by the customer's acceptance of the results of our testing program prior to shipment to the customer, or (2) the revenue is deferred until customer acceptance occurs.
21510_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	Sales to end-users in the scientific market typically require installation and, thus, involve post-delivery obligations; however our post-delivery installation obligations are not essential to the functionality of our products.
21510_11_ITEM7_P68_S1	We defer revenue related to installation services until completion of these services.
21510_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	For most products, training is not provided; therefore, no post-delivery training obligation exists.
21510_11_ITEM7_P69_S1	However, when training is provided to our customers, it is typically priced separately and recognized as revenue as these services are provided.
21510_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued a new accounting standard for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements.
21510_11_ITEM7_P70_S1	The new standard changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable to be based on the relative selling price.
21510_11_ITEM7_P70_S2	The FASB also issued a new accounting standard for certain revenue arrangements that include software elements.
21510_11_ITEM7_P70_S3	This new standard excludes software that is contained on a tangible product from the scope of software revenue guidance if the software is essential to the tangible product's functionality.
21510_11_ITEM7_P70_S4	We prospectively adopted both these standards in the first quarter of fiscal 2011.
21510_11_ITEM7_P70_S5	The impact of adopting these standards was not material to net sales or our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2011.
21510_11_ITEM7_P70_S6	The new accounting standards for revenue recognition if applied in the same manner to the year ended October 2, 2010 would not have had a material impact on net sales or to our consolidated financial statements for that fiscal year.
21510_11_ITEM7_P70_S7	Under these new standards, when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements, such as products and/or services, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy.
21510_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	price of each deliverable using vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ), if it exists, and otherwise third-party evidence ( TPE ).
21510_11_ITEM7_P71_S1	If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exists, we use estimated selling price ( ESP ).
21510_11_ITEM7_P71_S2	We generally expect that we will not be able to establish TPE due to the nature of the markets in which we compete, and, as such, we typically will determine selling price using VSOE or if not available, ESP.
21510_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	Our basis for establishing VSOE of a deliverable's selling price consists of standalone sales transactions when the same or similar product or service is sold separately.
21510_11_ITEM7_P72_S1	However, when services are never sold separately, such as product installation services, VSOE is based on the product's estimated installation hours based on historical experience multiplied by the standard service billing rate.
21510_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling price for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow price range, as defined by us.
21510_11_ITEM7_P73_S1	We also consider the geographies in which the products or services are sold, major product and service groups, and other environmental variables in determining VSOE.
21510_11_ITEM7_P73_S2	Absent the existence of VSOE and TPE, our determination of a deliverable's ESP involves evaluating several factors based on the specific facts and circumstances of these arrangements, which include pricing strategy and policies driven by geographies, market conditions, competitive landscape, correlation between proportionate selling price and list price established by management having the relevant authority, and other environmental variables in which the deliverable is sold.
21510_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	For multiple element arrangements which include extended maintenance contracts, we allocate and defer the amount of consideration equal to the separately stated price and recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
21510_11_ITEM7_P75_S0	Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill We evaluate long-lived assets and amortizable intangible assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances or our planned use of assets indicate that their carrying amounts may not be fully recoverable or that their useful lives are no longer appropriate.
21510_11_ITEM7_P75_S1	Reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying values of the assets are impaired based on comparison to the undiscounted expected future cash flows identifiable to such long-lived and amortizable intangible assets.
21510_11_ITEM7_P75_S2	If the comparison indicates that impairment exists, the impaired asset is written down to its fair value.
21510_11_ITEM7_P76_S0	We have determined that our reporting units are the same as our operating segments as each constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results.
21510_11_ITEM7_P76_S1	We make this determination in a manner consistent with how the operating segments are managed.
21510_11_ITEM7_P76_S2	Based on this analysis, we have identified two reporting units which are our reportable segments: CLC and SLS.
21510_11_ITEM7_P77_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and written down when impaired (see Note 8 "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).
21510_11_ITEM7_P77_S1	We generally perform our annual impairment tests during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter, with any resulting impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.
21510_11_ITEM7_P77_S2	During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, our stock price declined substantially which, combined with expectations of declines in forecasted operating results due to the slowdown in the global economy, led the Company to conclude that a triggering event for review for potential goodwill impairment had occurred.
21510_11_ITEM7_P77_S3	Accordingly, as of December 27, 2008, we performed an interim goodwill impairment evaluation.
21510_11_ITEM7_P78_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the respective fair value with the respective carrying value of the reporting unit.
21510_11_ITEM7_P78_S1	If such comparison indicates a potential impairment, then the impairment is determined as the difference between the recorded value of goodwill and its fair value.
21510_11_ITEM7_P79_S0	The performance of this test is a two-step process.
21510_11_ITEM7_P80_S0	Step 1 of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill.
21510_11_ITEM7_P80_S1	If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, we perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss if any.
21510_11_ITEM7_P81_S0	Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit's goodwill against the carrying value of that goodwill.
21510_11_ITEM7_P82_S0	We have historically relied on the Income approach to determine the fair value of our reporting units.
21510_11_ITEM7_P82_S1	In the first quarter of fiscal 2009, when we determined that a triggering event had occurred, we subsequently determined that it would be appropriate to rely on the following three valuation approaches to determine the fair value of both of our reporting units.
21510_11_ITEM7_P83_S0	(1) The Income approach utilizes the discounted cash flow model to provide an estimation of fair value based on the cash flows that a business expects to generate.
21510_11_ITEM7_P83_S1	These cash flows are based on forecasts developed internally by management which are then discounted at an after tax rate of return required by equity and debt market participants of a business enterprise.
21510_11_ITEM7_P83_S2	This rate of return or cost of capital is weighted based on the capitalization of comparable companies.
21510_11_ITEM7_P83_S3	(2) The Market approach determines fair value by comparing the reporting units to comparable companies in similar lines of business that are publicly traded.
21510_11_ITEM7_P83_S4	Total Enterprise Value (TEV) multiples such as TEV to revenues and TEV to earnings (if applicable) before interest and taxes of the publicly traded companies are calculated.
21510_11_ITEM7_P83_S5	These multiples are then applied to the reporting unit's operating results to obtain an estimate of fair value.
21510_11_ITEM7_P84_S0	A comparison is done between the reporting units and other similar businesses.
21510_11_ITEM7_P84_S1	Total Enterprise Value multiples for revenue and earnings as noted in the Market approach above are calculated from the comparable companies and then applied to the reporting unit's operating results to obtain an estimate of fair value.
21510_11_ITEM7_P84_S2	Each of these three approaches captures aspects of value in each reporting unit.
21510_11_ITEM7_P84_S3	The Income approach captures our expected future performance, the Market approach captures how investors view the reporting units through other competitors; and, the Transaction approach captures value through transactions for sales of similar types of companies.
21510_11_ITEM7_P84_S4	We believe these valuation approaches are proven valuation techniques and methodologies for our industry and are widely accepted by investors.
21510_11_ITEM7_P84_S5	As none were perceived by us to deliver any greater indication of value than the other, we weighted each of the approaches equally.
21510_11_ITEM7_P84_S6	The sensitivity analysis performed by management determined that by changing the weighting placed on the three approaches, the result of the Step 1 test for both reporting units was not affected.
21510_11_ITEM7_P85_S0	The valuation analysis requires significant judgments and estimates to be made by management in particular related to the forecast.
21510_11_ITEM7_P85_S1	The assumed growth rates and gross margins as well as period expenses were determined based on internally developed forecasts considering our future plans.
21510_11_ITEM7_P85_S2	The assumptions used were management's best estimates based on projected results and market conditions as of the date of testing.
21510_11_ITEM7_P85_S3	In order to test the sensitivity of these fair values, management further reviewed other scenarios relative to these assumptions to see if the resulting impact on fair values would have resulted in a different Step 1 conclusion for the CLC and SLS reporting units.
21510_11_ITEM7_P85_S4	Based on these forecast scenarios, the fair value of both reporting units was re-calculated.
21510_11_ITEM7_P85_S5	In addition, this sensitivity analysis applied more conservative assumptions with regard to control premiums as well as multipliers used in the Market approach and the Transaction approach.
21510_11_ITEM7_P85_S6	In each of the sensitivity analyses performed, the CLC reporting unit failed and the SLS reporting unit passed.
21510_11_ITEM7_P85_S7	None of the outcomes of the sensitivity analyses performed would have impacted our Step 1 conclusions or the non-cash impairment charge for goodwill of $19.3 million recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2009.
21510_11_ITEM7_P86_S0	Sensitivity was also applied to the discount rate used in the Income approach for both the CLC and SLS reporting units.
21510_11_ITEM7_P86_S1	At December 27, 2008, the discount rate for the CLC reporting unit could have been reduced by more than 40% and still resulted in a failure.
21510_11_ITEM7_P86_S2	For the SLS reporting unit, the discount rate could have been increased by more than 40% and still resulted in no impairment.
21510_11_ITEM7_P87_S0	During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, our expectations of declines in forecasted operating results due to the slowdown in the global economy and the further declines in our stock price led us to conclude that a triggering event for review for potential goodwill impairment had occurred.
21510_11_ITEM7_P87_S1	Accordingly, as of April 4, 2009, we performed an interim goodwill impairment evaluation.
21510_11_ITEM7_P87_S2	This interim impairment evaluation utilized the same valuation techniques used in our impairment valuation in the first quarter of fiscal 2009.
21510_11_ITEM7_P87_S3	A similar sensitivity analysis was also done at April 4, 2009 where we determined that the discount rate used in the Income approach for the SLS reporting unit could have been increased by approximately 20% and still resulted in no impairment.
21510_11_ITEM7_P87_S4	Based on the results of our Step 1 analysis, we determined that no additional goodwill impairment was indicated.
21510_11_ITEM7_P87_S5	During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009, and the first three quarters of fiscal 2010, we noted no indications of impairment or triggering events to cause us to review goodwill for potential impairment.
21510_11_ITEM7_P87_S6	For fiscal 2010, we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter and noted no impairment.
21510_11_ITEM7_P88_S0	As noted in the valuation analysis discussion above, such analysis requires significant judgments and estimates to be made by management in particular related to the forecast.
21510_11_ITEM7_P89_S0	The assumed growth rates and gross margins as well as period expenses were determined based on internally developed forecasts considering our future plans.
21510_11_ITEM7_P89_S1	The assumptions used were management's best estimates based on projected results and market conditions as of the date of testing.
21510_11_ITEM7_P89_S2	Utilizing the Income Approach, we noted no impairment.
21510_11_ITEM7_P89_S3	Based on our evaluation, the fair values of each of the two operating segments significantly exceeded their carrying value.
21510_11_ITEM7_P89_S4	In order to test the sensitivity of these fair values, management further reviewed other scenarios relative to these assumptions to see if the resulting impact on fair values would have resulted in a different conclusion for the CLC and SLS reporting units.
21510_11_ITEM7_P89_S5	Sensitivity was applied to the discount rate used in the Income approach for both the CLC and SLS reporting units.
21510_11_ITEM7_P89_S6	The discount rate for the CLC and SLS reporting units could have been increased by more than 25% and still resulted in no impairment.
21510_11_ITEM7_P89_S7	Based on the outcome of this testing and sensitivity analysis, we decided it would not be necessary to utilize all three testing methods for this annual test.
21510_11_ITEM7_P90_S0	At October 1, 2011 , we had $76.0 million of goodwill, $18.0 million of purchased intangible assets and $104.5 million of property and equipment on our consolidated balance sheet.
21510_11_ITEM7_P91_S0	Under the goodwill standards, a company may carry forward the detailed determination of a reporting unit from one year to the next if certain criteria have been met.
21510_11_ITEM7_P92_S0	amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting unit by a substantial margin, and based on an analysis of events that have occurred and circumstances that have changed since the most recent fair value determination, the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is remote.
21510_11_ITEM7_P92_S1	Based on our analysis and a review of the criteria, using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 , we determined that we had met the requirements of the goodwill standard for carrying forward our fair value determination from fiscal 2010 , and did not perform detailed testing of the fair value of our reporting units for fiscal 2011 .
21510_11_ITEM7_P92_S2	Between the completion of that testing and the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 , we noted no indications of impairment or triggering events to cause us to review goodwill for potential impairment; based on our evaluation, the fair values of each of the two operating segments significantly exceeded their carrying value as of that date.
21510_11_ITEM7_P92_S3	As no impairment indicators were present during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 , we believe these values remain recoverable.
21510_11_ITEM7_P92_S4	It is reasonably possible that the estimates of anticipated future net revenue, the remaining estimated economic life of the products and technologies, or both, could differ from those used to assess the recoverability of these assets in fiscal 2010.
21510_11_ITEM7_P92_S5	In addition, if the price of our common stock were to significantly decrease combined with any other adverse change in market conditions, thus indicating that the underlying fair value of our reporting units or other long-lived assets may have decreased, we may be required to assess the recoverability of such assets in the period such circumstances are identified.
21510_11_ITEM7_P92_S6	In that event, additional impairment charges or shortened useful lives of certain long-lived assets may be required.
21510_11_ITEM7_P93_S0	Inventory Valuation We record our inventory at the lower of cost (computed on a first-in, first-out basis) or market.
21510_11_ITEM7_P93_S1	We write-down our inventory to its estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
21510_11_ITEM7_P93_S2	Inventory write-downs are generally recorded within guidelines set by management when the inventory for a device exceeds 12 months of its demand and when individual parts have been in inventory for greater than 12 months.
21510_11_ITEM7_P93_S3	If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required which could materially affect our future results of operations.
21510_11_ITEM7_P93_S4	Due to rapidly changing forecasts and orders, additional write-downs for excess or obsolete inventory, while not currently expected, could be required in the future.
21510_11_ITEM7_P93_S5	In the event that alternative future uses of fully written down inventories are identified, we may experience better than normal profit margins when such inventory is sold.
21510_11_ITEM7_P93_S6	Differences between actual results and previous estimates of excess and obsolete inventory could materially affect our future results of operations.
21510_11_ITEM7_P94_S0	We write-down our demo inventory by amortizing the cost of demo inventory over a twenty month period starting from the fourth month after such inventory is placed in service.
21510_11_ITEM7_P94_S1	We provide warranties on certain of our product sales and allowances for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale.
21510_11_ITEM7_P94_S2	The determination of such allowances requires us to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty.
21510_11_ITEM7_P94_S3	We currently establish warranty reserves based on historical warranty costs for each product line.
21510_11_ITEM7_P94_S4	The weighted average warranty period covered is approximately 15 months.
21510_11_ITEM7_P94_S5	If actual return rates and/or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates, adjustments to cost of sales may be required in future periods.
21510_11_ITEM7_P95_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation using fair value.
21510_11_ITEM7_P95_S1	We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes Merton model and estimate the fair value of market-based performance restricted stock units granted using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
21510_11_ITEM7_P95_S2	We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.
21510_11_ITEM7_P95_S3	We amortize the fair value of stock options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods.
21510_11_ITEM7_P95_S4	We value service-based restricted stock units using the intrinsic value method and amortize the value on a straight-line basis over the restriction period.
21510_11_ITEM7_P95_S5	We value market-based performance restricted stock units using a Monte Carlo simulation model and amortize the value over the performance period, with no adjustment in future periods, based upon the actual shareholder return over the performance period.
21510_11_ITEM7_P96_S0	U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") requires the use of option pricing models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options.
21510_11_ITEM7_P97_S0	The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short-lived exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
21510_11_ITEM7_P97_S1	In addition, option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the options expected life, the expected price volatility of the underlying stock and an estimate of expected forfeitures.
21510_11_ITEM7_P98_S0	Our computation of expected volatility considers historical volatility and market-based implied volatility.
21510_11_ITEM7_P99_S0	employee data and could differ from actual forfeitures.
21510_11_ITEM7_P99_S1	See Note 14 "Employee Stock Option and Benefit Plans" in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of our stock-based employee compensation plans and the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of stock-based employee compensation.
21510_11_ITEM7_P100_S0	Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income tax provision (benefit) in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
21510_11_ITEM7_P100_S1	This process involves us estimating our current income tax provision (benefit) together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
21510_11_ITEM7_P100_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets.
21510_11_ITEM7_P101_S0	We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized.
21510_11_ITEM7_P101_S1	While we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made.
21510_11_ITEM7_P101_S2	Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.
21510_11_ITEM7_P102_S0	Federal income taxes have not been provided for on a portion of the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested.
21510_11_ITEM7_P102_S1	The total amount of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which we have not yet recorded federal income taxes was approximately $198.7 million at fiscal 2011 year-end.
21510_11_ITEM7_P102_S2	In addition to federal income taxes (which are not practicably determinable), withholding taxes of approximately $9.4 million would be payable upon repatriation of such earnings which would result in additional foreign tax credits.
21510_11_ITEM7_P103_S0	The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 ( Act ), was enacted on December 17, 2010.
21510_11_ITEM7_P103_S1	Under the Act, the federal research and development credit was retroactively extended for amounts paid or incurred after December 31, 2009 through December 31, 2011.
21510_11_ITEM7_P103_S2	The effects of the change in the tax law are recognized in our first quarter of fiscal 2011, which is the quarter that the law was enacted.
21510_11_ITEM7_P104_S0	In addition to the federal legislation, the state of California approved its 2010-2011 budget on October 8, 2010 that includes modifications to the tax law provisions that were previously set to become effective with tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2011.
21510_11_ITEM7_P104_S1	Accordingly, we were able to benefit from additional research and development tax credits in fiscal year 2011 that were previously limited.
21510_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
21510_11_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
21510_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Interest rate sensitivity A portion of our investment portfolio is composed of fixed income securities.
21510_11_ITEM7A_P1_S1	These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase.
21510_11_ITEM7A_P1_S2	If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10% from levels at fiscal 2011 year-end, the fair value of the portfolio, based on quoted market prices in active markets involving similar assets, would decline by an immaterial amount.
21510_11_ITEM7A_P1_S3	We have the ability to generally hold our fixed income investments until maturity and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio.
21510_11_ITEM7A_P1_S4	If necessary, we may sell short-term investments prior to maturity to meet our liquidity needs.
21510_11_ITEM7A_P1_S5	At fiscal 2011 year-end, the fair value of our available-for-sale debt securities was $46.6 million, all of which was classified as short-term investments.

21510_11_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The majority of our sales are transacted in U.S. dollars.
21510_11_ITEM7A_P2_S2	However, we do generate revenues in other currencies, primarily the Euro and the Japanese Yen.
21510_11_ITEM7A_P2_S3	As a result, our earnings, cash flows and cash balances are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
21510_11_ITEM7A_P2_S4	A substantial portion of our cash balance is Euro denominated.
21510_11_ITEM7A_P2_S5	We attempt to limit these exposures through financial market instruments.
21510_11_ITEM7A_P2_S6	We utilize derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts with maturities of two months or less, to manage our exposure associated with anticipated cash flows and net asset and liability positions denominated in foreign currencies.
21510_11_ITEM7A_P2_S7	Gains and losses on the forward contracts are mitigated by gains and losses on the underlying instruments.
21510_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
21510_11_ITEM7A_P3_S1	We do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments.
21510_11_ITEM7A_P3_S2	There can be no assurance that these strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately.
21510_11_ITEM7A_P4_S0	If a financial counterparty to any of our hedging arrangements experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge, we may experience material financial losses.
21510_11_ITEM7A_P5_S0	In the current economic environment, the risk of failure of a financial party remains high.
21510_11_ITEM7A_P5_S1	A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.
21510_11_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The following table provides information about our foreign exchange forward contracts at October 1, 2011 .
21510_11_ITEM7A_P6_S1	The table presents the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates, the value of the contracts in U.S. dollars at the contract exchange rate as of the contract maturity date and fair value.

21510_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures; as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report ("Evaluation Date").
21510_11_ITEM9A_P0_S1	The controls evaluation was done under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.
21510_11_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
21510_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the Company.
21510_11_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 1, 2011 , utilizing the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.
21510_11_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on the assessment by management, we determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 1, 2011 .
21510_11_ITEM9A_P1_S3	The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 1, 2011 has been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears below.
21510_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
21510_11_ITEM9A_P2_S1	The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company's assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the Company's receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company's management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
21510_11_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that the Company's internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud.
21510_11_ITEM9A_P3_S0	A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
21510_11_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
21510_11_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
21510_11_ITEM9A_P3_S3	Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
21510_11_ITEM9A_P3_S4	There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended October 1, 2011 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
21510_11_ITEM9A_P4_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Coherent, Inc.: We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Coherent, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") as of October 1, 2011 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
21510_11_ITEM9A_P4_S1	The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
21510_11_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
21510_11_ITEM9A_P4_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
21510_11_ITEM9A_P4_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
21510_11_ITEM9A_P4_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
21510_11_ITEM9A_P4_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
21510_11_ITEM9A_P5_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
21510_11_ITEM9A_P5_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
21510_11_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
21510_11_ITEM9A_P5_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
21510_11_ITEM9A_P5_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 1, 2011 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
21510_11_ITEM9A_P5_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended October 1, 2011 , of the Company and our report dated November 30, 2011, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

21510_11_ITEM15_P10_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
21510_11_ITEM15_P10_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

21510_11_ITEM15_P13_S0	DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Founded in 1966, Coherent, Inc. provides photonics-based solutions in a broad range of commercial and scientific research applications.

21510_11_ITEM15_P14_S0	Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30.
21510_11_ITEM15_P14_S1	Fiscal years 2011 , 2010 and 2009 ended on October 1, October 2, and October 3, respectively, and are referred to in these financial statements as fiscal 2011 , fiscal 2010 , and fiscal 2009 for convenience.
21510_11_ITEM15_P14_S2	Fiscal 2009 included 53 weeks; fiscal 2011 and 2010 included 52 weeks.
21510_11_ITEM15_P14_S3	The fiscal years of the majority of our international subsidiaries end on September 30.
21510_11_ITEM15_P14_S4	Accordingly, the financial statements of these subsidiaries as of that date and for the years then ended have been used for our consolidated financial statements.
21510_11_ITEM15_P14_S5	Management believes that the impact of the use of different year-ends is immaterial to our consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.
21510_11_ITEM15_P15_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
21510_11_ITEM15_P15_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
21510_11_ITEM15_P16_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Coherent, Inc. and its majority-owned subsidiaries (collectively, "the Company", "we", "our", or "Coherent").

21510_11_ITEM15_P17_S0	Investments in business entities in which we do not have control, but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies (generally 20% - 50% ownership) are accounted for by the equity method.
21510_11_ITEM15_P18_S0	The carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
21510_11_ITEM15_P19_S0	Short-term investments are comprised of available-for-sale securities, which are carried at fair value.

21510_11_ITEM15_P19_S2	The recorded carrying amount of our long-term obligations approximates fair value at fiscal 2011 and 2010 year-ends.
21510_11_ITEM15_P20_S0	Foreign exchange contracts are stated at fair value based on prevailing financial market information.
21510_11_ITEM15_P21_S0	Cash Equivalents All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.
21510_11_ITEM15_P22_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that may potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable.
21510_11_ITEM15_P22_S1	At fiscal 2011 year-end, the majority of our short-term investments are in corporate notes and obligations, bank certificates of deposit and federal agency obligations.
21510_11_ITEM15_P22_S2	Cash equivalents and short-term investments are maintained with several financial institutions and may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such balances.
21510_11_ITEM15_P22_S3	At October 1, 2011 , we held cash and cash equivalents outside the U.S. in certain of our foreign operations totaling approximately $145.1 million, the majority of which is denominated in the Euro.
21510_11_ITEM15_P22_S4	The majority of our accounts receivable are derived from sales to customers for commercial applications.
21510_11_ITEM15_P22_S5	We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition and limit the amount of credit extended when deemed necessary but generally require no collateral.
21510_11_ITEM15_P22_S6	We maintain reserves for potential credit losses.
21510_11_ITEM15_P22_S7	Our products are broadly distributed and there were no customers who accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable at fiscal 2011 or fiscal 2010 year-end.

21510_11_ITEM15_P28_S0	The fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.
21510_11_ITEM15_P28_S1	The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset.
21510_11_ITEM15_P28_S2	All of our existing asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return the property to its original condition upon lease termination at various sites and costs to clean up and dispose of certain fixed assets at our Finland site.
21510_11_ITEM15_P28_S3	We estimated that as of fiscal 2011 year-end, gross expected future cash flows of $2.2 million would be required to fulfill these obligations.
21510_11_ITEM15_P28_S4	The following table reconciles changes in our asset retirement liability for fiscal 2011 and 2010 (in thousands):

21510_11_ITEM15_P30_S0	At October 1, 2011 , $1,878,000 of the asset retirement liability is included in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
21510_11_ITEM15_P30_S1	At October 2, 2010 , $328,000 of the asset retirement liability is included in other current liabilities and $1,409,000 is included in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
21510_11_ITEM15_P31_S0	Long-lived Assets We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, whenever events or changes in business circumstances or our planned use of long-lived assets indicate that their carrying amounts may not be fully recoverable or that their useful lives are no longer appropriate.
21510_11_ITEM15_P31_S1	Reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying values of long-lived assets are impaired based on a comparison to the undiscounted expected future net cash flows.
21510_11_ITEM15_P31_S2	If the comparison indicates that impairment exists, long-lived assets that are classified as held and used are written down to their respective fair values.
21510_11_ITEM15_P32_S0	When long-lived assets are classified as held for sale, they are written down to their respective fair values less costs to sell.
21510_11_ITEM15_P32_S1	Significant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that is used in the preparation of expected undiscounted cash flows.
21510_11_ITEM15_P32_S2	For fiscal years 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , there were no significant asset impairments recorded.
21510_11_ITEM15_P32_S3	Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and written down when impaired (see Note 8).
21510_11_ITEM15_P32_S4	Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the respective fair value with the respective carrying value of the reporting unit.
21510_11_ITEM15_P33_S0	Fair value is determined using the Income Approach (discounted cash flow approach) valuation methodology.
21510_11_ITEM15_P33_S1	Absent any impairment indicators, we perform our annual impairment tests during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year using opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter, with any resulting impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.
21510_11_ITEM15_P34_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets, including acquired existing technology, patents, customer lists, order backlog, trade name, non-compete agreements, production know-how and in-process research and development, are amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of one year to fifteen years.
21510_11_ITEM15_P34_S1	We provide warranties on certain of our product sales and reserves for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale.
21510_11_ITEM15_P34_S2	The determination of such reserves requires us to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty.
21510_11_ITEM15_P34_S3	We currently establish warranty reserves based on historical warranty costs for each product line.
21510_11_ITEM15_P34_S4	The weighted average warranty period covered is approximately 15 months.
21510_11_ITEM15_P34_S5	If actual return rates and/or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates, adjustments to cost of sales may be required in future periods.
21510_11_ITEM15_P35_S0	Components of the reserve for warranty costs during fiscal 2011 , 2010 and 2009 were as follows (in thousands):

21510_11_ITEM15_P37_S0	Revenue Recognition In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued a new accounting standard for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements.
21510_11_ITEM15_P37_S1	The new standard changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable to be based on the relative selling price.
21510_11_ITEM15_P37_S2	The FASB also issued a new accounting standard for certain revenue arrangements that include software elements.
21510_11_ITEM15_P37_S3	This new standard excludes software that is contained on a tangible product from the scope of software revenue guidance if the software is essential to the tangible product's functionality.
21510_11_ITEM15_P37_S4	We prospectively adopted both these standards in the first quarter of fiscal 2011.
21510_11_ITEM15_P37_S5	The impact of adopting these standards was not material to net sales or our condensed consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2011 .
21510_11_ITEM15_P37_S6	The new accounting standards for revenue recognition if applied in the same manner to the year ended October 2, 2010 would not have had a material impact on net sales or to our consolidated financial statements for that fiscal year.
21510_11_ITEM15_P38_S0	Under these new standards, when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements, such as products and/or services, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy.
21510_11_ITEM15_P39_S0	Using the selling price hierarchy, we determine the selling price of each deliverable using vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ), if it exists, and otherwise third-party evidence ( TPE ).
21510_11_ITEM15_P39_S1	If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exists, we use estimated selling price ( ESP ).
21510_11_ITEM15_P39_S2	We generally expect that we will not be able to establish TPE due to the nature of the markets in which we compete, and, as such, we typically will determine selling price using VSOE or if not available, ESP.
21510_11_ITEM15_P40_S0	Our basis for establishing VSOE of a deliverable's selling price consists of standalone sales transactions when the same or similar product or service is sold separately.
21510_11_ITEM15_P40_S1	However, when services are never sold separately, such as product installation services, VSOE is based on the product's estimated installation hours based on historical experience multiplied by the standard service billing rate.
21510_11_ITEM15_P41_S0	In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling price for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow price range, as defined by us.
21510_11_ITEM15_P41_S1	We also consider the geographies in which the products or services are sold, major product and service groups, and other environmental variables in determining VSOE.
21510_11_ITEM15_P41_S2	Absent the existence of VSOE and TPE, our determination of a deliverable's ESP involves evaluating several factors based on the specific facts and circumstances of these arrangements, which include pricing strategy and policies driven by geographies, market conditions, competitive landscape, correlation between proportionate selling price and list price established by management having the relevant authority, and other environmental variables in which the deliverable is sold.
21510_11_ITEM15_P42_S0	For multiple element arrangements which include extended maintenance contracts, we allocate and defer the amount of consideration equal to the separately stated price and recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
21510_11_ITEM15_P42_S1	We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered or the service has been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured.
21510_11_ITEM15_P42_S2	Revenue from product sales is recorded when all of the foregoing conditions are met and risk of loss and title passes to the customer.
21510_11_ITEM15_P42_S3	Sales to customers are generally not subject to any price protection or return rights.
21510_11_ITEM15_P42_S4	The vast majority of our sales are made to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), distributors, resellers and end-users in the non-scientific market.
21510_11_ITEM15_P42_S5	Sales made to these customers do not require installation of the products by us and are not subject to other post-delivery obligations, except in occasional instances where we have agreed to perform installation or provide training.
21510_11_ITEM15_P42_S6	In those instances, we defer revenue related to installation services or training until these services have been rendered.
21510_11_ITEM15_P42_S7	We allocate revenue from multiple element arrangements to the various elements based upon relative fair values.

21510_11_ITEM15_P44_S0	certain of our sales to OEM customers have customer acceptance provisions.
21510_11_ITEM15_P44_S1	Customer acceptance is generally limited to performance under our published product specifications.
21510_11_ITEM15_P44_S2	For the few product sales that have customer acceptance provisions because of higher than published specifications, (1) the products are tested and accepted by the customer at our site or by the customer's acceptance of the results of our testing program prior to shipment to the customer, or (2) the revenue is deferred until customer acceptance occurs.
21510_11_ITEM15_P45_S0	Sales to end-users in the scientific market typically require installation and, thus, involve post-delivery obligations; however, our post-delivery installation obligations are not essential to the functionality of our products.
21510_11_ITEM15_P45_S1	We defer revenue related to installation services until completion of these services.
21510_11_ITEM15_P46_S0	For most products, training is not provided; therefore, no post-delivery training obligation exists.
21510_11_ITEM15_P46_S1	However, when training is provided to our customers, it is typically priced separately and is recognized as revenue as these services are provided.
21510_11_ITEM15_P47_S0	We record taxes collected on revenue-producing activities on a net basis.
21510_11_ITEM15_P47_S1	Research and Development Research and development expenses include salaries, contractor and consultant fees, supplies and materials, as well as costs related to other overhead such as depreciation, facilities, utilities and other departmental expenses.
21510_11_ITEM15_P47_S2	The costs we incur with respect to internally developed technology and engineering services are included in research and development expenses as incurred as they do not directly relate to any particular licensee, license agreement or license fee.
21510_11_ITEM15_P47_S3	We treat third party and government funding of our research and development activity, where we are the primary beneficiary of such work conducted, as a credit to research and development cost.
21510_11_ITEM15_P47_S4	Amounts offset against research and development costs were not material in any of the periods presented.
21510_11_ITEM15_P48_S0	The functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are generally their respective local currencies.
21510_11_ITEM15_P48_S1	Accordingly, gains and losses from the translation of the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income ("OCI").
21510_11_ITEM15_P48_S2	Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in earnings.
21510_11_ITEM15_P49_S0	Derivatives U.S. GAAP requires that all derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.
21510_11_ITEM15_P49_S1	If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings.
21510_11_ITEM15_P49_S2	If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of the changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in OCI and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings.
21510_11_ITEM15_P49_S3	Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in other income (expense).
21510_11_ITEM15_P50_S0	Our objective of holding derivatives is to minimize the risks of foreign currency fluctuation by using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impact of these exposures.
21510_11_ITEM15_P51_S0	Principal currencies hedged include the Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Korean Won, Chinese Renminbi and Canadian dollar.
21510_11_ITEM15_P51_S1	Forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to hedge the impact of the variability in exchange rates on accounts receivable and collections denominated in certain foreign currencies.
21510_11_ITEM15_P52_S0	Our forward contracts have maturities of two months or less and changes in fair value of these derivatives are recognized in other income (expense).
21510_11_ITEM15_P53_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period, excluding unvested restricted stock.

21510_11_ITEM15_P56_S0	The following table presents information necessary to calculate basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share (in thousands, except per share data):
21510_11_ITEM15_P57_S0	_______________________________________ (1) Net of unvested restricted stock A total of 2,416 , 1,221,143 and 2,880,395 potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the dilutive share calculation for fiscal 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively, as their effect was anti-dilutive.
21510_11_ITEM15_P58_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation using the fair value of the awards granted.
21510_11_ITEM15_P58_S1	We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes Merton model.
21510_11_ITEM15_P58_S2	We value restricted stock units using the intrinsic value method.
21510_11_ITEM15_P58_S3	We use a Monte Carlo model to estimate the fair value of market-based performance restricted stock units.
21510_11_ITEM15_P58_S4	We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option and restricted stock unit forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those options and awards that are expected to vest.
21510_11_ITEM15_P58_S5	We amortize the fair value of stock options and awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods.
21510_11_ITEM15_P58_S6	See Note 14 "Employee Stock Option and Benefit Plans" for a description of our stock-based employee compensation plans and the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of stock-based employee compensation.
21510_11_ITEM15_P59_S0	We record costs related to shipping and handling of revenue in cost of sales for all periods presented.
21510_11_ITEM15_P59_S1	Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were $4.1 million , $2.6 million and $2.2 million in fiscal 2011 , fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 , respectively.
21510_11_ITEM15_P60_S0	Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income tax provision (benefit) in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
21510_11_ITEM15_P60_S1	This process involves us estimating our current income tax provision (benefit) together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
21510_11_ITEM15_P60_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets.
21510_11_ITEM15_P61_S0	We account for uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740-10 (formerly FASB Financial Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes ), which creates a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.
21510_11_ITEM15_P61_S1	This standard provides a two-step approach for evaluating tax positions.
21510_11_ITEM15_P61_S2	The first step, recognition, occurs when a company concludes (based solely on the technical aspects of the matter) that a tax provision is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority.
21510_11_ITEM15_P61_S3	The second step, measurement, is only considered after step one has been satisfied and measures any tax benefit at the largest amount that is deemed more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the uncertainty.
21510_11_ITEM15_P61_S4	These determinations involve significant judgment by management.

21510_11_ITEM15_P63_S0	standard or when they are resolved through negotiation or litigation with factual interpretation, judgment and certainty.
21510_11_ITEM15_P64_S0	Tax laws and regulations themselves are complex and are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, evolution of regulations and court filings.
21510_11_ITEM15_P64_S1	Therefore, the actual liability for U.S. or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially to reverse previously recorded tax liabilities.
21510_11_ITEM15_P65_S0	We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized.
21510_11_ITEM15_P65_S1	While we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made.
21510_11_ITEM15_P65_S2	Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.
21510_11_ITEM15_P66_S0	Federal income taxes have not been provided for on a portion of the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested.
21510_11_ITEM15_P66_S1	The total amount of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which we have not yet recorded federal income taxes was approximately $198.7 million at fiscal 2011 year-end.
21510_11_ITEM15_P66_S2	In addition to federal income taxes (which are not practicably determinable), withholding taxes of approximately $9.4 million at fiscal 2011 year-end would be payable upon repatriation of such earnings which would result in additional foreign tax credits.
21510_11_ITEM15_P67_S0	As discussed under "Revenue Recognition", we adopted the FASB's accounting standard for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements and the FASB's accounting standard for certain revenue arrangements that include software elements.
21510_11_ITEM15_P67_S1	We prospectively adopted both these standards in the first quarter of fiscal 2011.
21510_11_ITEM15_P67_S2	The impact of adopting these standards was not material to net sales or our condensed consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2011 .
21510_11_ITEM15_P68_S0	In June 2009, the FASB issued amendments to the accounting rules for variable interest entities (VIEs) and for transfers of financial assets.
21510_11_ITEM15_P68_S1	The new guidance eliminates the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and requires ongoing qualitative reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary.
21510_11_ITEM15_P69_S0	The determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on, among other things, an entity's purpose and design and a company's ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance.
21510_11_ITEM15_P69_S1	In addition, qualifying special purpose entities ( QSPE ) are no longer exempt from consolidation under the amended guidance.
21510_11_ITEM15_P69_S2	The amendments also limit the circumstances in which a financial asset, or a portion of a financial asset, should be derecognized when the transferor has not transferred the entire original financial asset to an entity that is not consolidated with the transferor in the financial statements being presented, and/or when the transferor has continuing involvement with the transferred financial asset.
21510_11_ITEM15_P69_S3	We adopted these amendments in our first quarter of fiscal year 2011 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
21510_11_ITEM15_P70_S0	In July 2010, the FASB issued an accounting standard update defining a milestone and determining what criteria must be met to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research or development transactions.
21510_11_ITEM15_P70_S1	The update provides guidance on the criteria which must be met to determine if the milestone method of revenue recognition is appropriate, whether a milestone is substantive and the disclosures that must be made if the method is elected.
21510_11_ITEM15_P70_S2	We adopted this standard on a prospective basis in our first quarter of fiscal year 2011 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
21510_11_ITEM15_P71_S0	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In June 2011, the FASB issued a final standard requiring the presentation of net income and other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive, statements of net income and other comprehensive income.
21510_11_ITEM15_P71_S1	The new standard eliminates the option currently elected by the Company to present items of other comprehensive income in the annual statement of changes in stockholders' equity.
21510_11_ITEM15_P71_S2	The new requirements do not change the components of comprehensive income recognized in net income or other comprehensive income, or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income.
21510_11_ITEM15_P71_S3	Earnings per share computations do not change.
21510_11_ITEM15_P71_S4	The new requirements are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011.

21510_11_ITEM15_P74_S0	In May 2011, the FASB issued additional guidance on fair value measurements that clarifies the application of existing guidance and disclosure requirements, changes certain fair value measurement principles and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements.
21510_11_ITEM15_P74_S1	The updated guidance is effective on a prospective basis for financial statements issued for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2011.
21510_11_ITEM15_P74_S2	The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
21510_11_ITEM15_P75_S0	In December 2010, the FASB amended its existing guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets.
21510_11_ITEM15_P75_S1	This authoritative guidance modifies Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts.
21510_11_ITEM15_P75_S2	For those reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if there are qualitative factors indicating that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists.
21510_11_ITEM15_P75_S3	The qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance which requires goodwill of a reporting unit to be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.
21510_11_ITEM15_P75_S4	This authoritative guidance becomes effective for us in fiscal 2012 .
21510_11_ITEM15_P75_S5	The implementation of this authoritative guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

21510_11_ITEM15_P76_S2	The closure of our Finland site was scheduled for completion by the end of fiscal 2010, but we delayed the closure due to increased demand for products manufactured in Finland.
21510_11_ITEM15_P76_S3	In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we ceased manufacturing operations in our Finland facility and recognized a $6.1 million gain, primarily in other income (expense), due to a non-recurring translation adjustment related to the dissolution of our Finland operations.
21510_11_ITEM15_P76_S4	We exited the facility in the third quarter of fiscal 2011.
21510_11_ITEM15_P76_S5	These closure plans resulted in charges primarily for employee termination and other exit related costs associated with a plan approved by management.

21510_11_ITEM15_P117_S0	GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS During the first quarter of fiscal 2009 , our stock price declined substantially which, combined with expectations of declines in forecasted operating results due to the slowdown in the global economy, led the Company to conclude that a triggering event for review for potential goodwill impairment had occurred.
21510_11_ITEM15_P117_S1	Accordingly, as of December 27, 2008, we performed an interim goodwill impairment evaluation.
21510_11_ITEM15_P118_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment first by comparing each reporting unit's fair value to its respective carrying value.
21510_11_ITEM15_P118_S1	If such comparison indicates a potential impairment, then the impairment is determined as the difference between the recorded value of goodwill and its fair value.
21510_11_ITEM15_P119_S0	The performance of this test is a two-step process.
21510_11_ITEM15_P120_S0	Step 1 of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill.
21510_11_ITEM15_P120_S1	If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, we perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss.
21510_11_ITEM15_P121_S0	Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the affected reporting unit's goodwill against the carrying value of that goodwill.
21510_11_ITEM15_P121_S1	The reporting units we evaluated for goodwill impairment were determined to be the same as our operating segments, Commercial Lasers and Components ("CLC") and Specialty Lasers and Systems ("SLS").
21510_11_ITEM15_P121_S2	We determined the fair value of our reporting units for the Step 1 test using a weighting of the Income (discounted cash flow), Market and Transaction approach valuation methodologies.
21510_11_ITEM15_P121_S3	Management completed and reviewed the results of the Step 1 analysis and concluded that a Step 2 analysis was required only for the CLC reporting unit.
21510_11_ITEM15_P121_S4	Our preliminary analysis indicated that the entire balance of the goodwill in the CLC reporting unit at that date was impaired and we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $19.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 .
21510_11_ITEM15_P121_S5	During the second quarter of fiscal 2009 , we completed the Step 2 analysis for the CLC reporting unit as of December 27, 2008 and determined that no further adjustments for CLC were required.
21510_11_ITEM15_P121_S6	The estimated fair value of our SLS reporting unit exceeded its carrying value so no further impairment analysis was required for this reporting unit.
21510_11_ITEM15_P121_S7	During the second quarter of fiscal 2009 , our expectations of declines in forecasted operating results due to the slowdown in the global economy and the further declines in our stock price led us to conclude that a second triggering event for review for potential goodwill impairment had occurred.
21510_11_ITEM15_P121_S8	Accordingly, as of April 4, 2009, we performed an interim goodwill impairment evaluation.
21510_11_ITEM15_P121_S9	This interim impairment evaluation utilized the same valuation techniques used in our impairment valuation in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 .
21510_11_ITEM15_P121_S10	Based on the results of our Step 1 analysis for that period, we determined there was no additional goodwill impairment.
21510_11_ITEM15_P121_S11	During the remainder of fiscal 2009 and during fiscal 2010 , we noted no indications of impairment or triggering events to cause us to review goodwill for potential impairment.
21510_11_ITEM15_P121_S12	We also noted no impairment during our annual testing which was performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 .
21510_11_ITEM15_P122_S0	Under the goodwill standards, a company may carry forward the detailed determination of the fair value of a reporting unit from one year to the next if certain criteria have been met.

21510_11_ITEM15_P124_S0	on an analysis of events that have occurred and circumstances that have changed since the most recent fair value determination, the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is remote.
21510_11_ITEM15_P124_S1	Based on our analysis and a review of the criteria, using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 , we determined that we had met the requirements of the goodwill standard for carrying forward our fair value determination from fiscal 2010 , and did not perform detailed calculation of the fair value of our reporting units for fiscal 2011 , but rather compared the fair values calculated in the prior year to the 2011 carrying values of our reporting units; based on our evaluation, the fair values of each of the two operating segments significantly exceeded their carrying value as of that date.
21510_11_ITEM15_P124_S2	Between the completion of that testing and the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 , we noted no indications of impairment or triggering events to cause us to review goodwill for potential impairment.
21510_11_ITEM15_P125_S0	The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment for fiscal 2011 and 2010 are as follows (in thousands):

21510_11_ITEM15_P159_S5	Restricted stock awards and restricted stock units are independent of option grants and are typically subject to vesting restrictions either time-based or performance-based conditions for vesting.
21510_11_ITEM15_P159_S6	Until restricted stock vests, shares (including those issuable upon vesting of the applicable restricted stock unit) are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the release of restrictions and cannot be transferred.

21510_11_ITEM15_P162_S0	The market-based performance restricted stock unit award grants are generally either subject to annual vesting over three years from the date of grant or subject to a single vest measurement three years from the date of grant, depending upon achievement of performance measurements ("Performance RSUs") ") based on the performance of the Company's Total Shareholder Returns (as defined) compared with the performance of the Russell 2000 Index.
21510_11_ITEM15_P162_S1	The Company previously granted Performance RSUs during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 which had a single vesting measurement date of November 14, 2010.
21510_11_ITEM15_P162_S2	These RSUs would have vested anywhere between 0% and 300% of the targeted amount based upon achievement by the Company of (a) an annual revenue threshold amount and (b) adjusted EBITDA percentage targets.
21510_11_ITEM15_P162_S3	The Company determined that the performance target had not been met and these awards were canceled in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 with no shares vesting.
21510_11_ITEM15_P163_S0	We recognize compensation expense for all share-based payment awards based on the fair value of such awards.
21510_11_ITEM15_P163_S1	The expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective requisite service period of the awards.
21510_11_ITEM15_P164_S0	Determining Fair Value Stock Options Valuation and amortization method We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing formula and a single option award approach.
21510_11_ITEM15_P164_S1	This fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period.
21510_11_ITEM15_P164_S2	The expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and was determined based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock-based awards, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior as influenced by changes to the terms of its stock-based awards.

21510_11_ITEM15_P167_S0	The expected dividend assumption is based on our current expectations about our anticipated dividend policy.
21510_11_ITEM15_P168_S0	The fair values of the Company's stock options granted to employees and shares purchased under the stock purchase plan for fiscal 2011 , 2010 and 2009 were estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:
21510_11_ITEM15_P169_S0	Time-Based Restricted Stock Units Time-based restricted stock units are fair valued at the closing market price on the date of grant.

21510_11_ITEM15_P169_S2	The performance stock unit agreements provide for the award of performance stock units with each unit representing the right to receive one share of Coherent, Inc. common stock to be issued after the applicable award period.
21510_11_ITEM15_P169_S3	The final number of units awarded for this grant will be determined as of vesting dates in November 2011, November 2012 and November 2013, based upon our total shareholder return over the performance period compared to the Russell 2000 Index and could range from a minimum of no units to a maximum of twice the initial award.
21510_11_ITEM15_P169_S4	The weighted average fair value for these performance units was $49.37 and was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model incorporating the following weighted average assumptions:
21510_11_ITEM15_P170_S0	We recognize the estimated cost of these awards, as determined under the simulation model, over the related service period, with no adjustment in future periods based upon the actual shareholder return over the performance period.

21510_11_ITEM15_P192_S0	The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in thousands):
21510_11_ITEM15_P193_S0	In determining our fiscal 2011 , 2010 and 2009 tax provisions under ASC Subtopic 740, "Income Taxes", we calculated the deferred tax assets and liabilities for each separate tax entity.
21510_11_ITEM15_P193_S1	We then considered a number of factors including the positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of our deferred tax assets to determine whether a valuation allowance should be recognized with respect to our deferred tax assets.
21510_11_ITEM15_P193_S2	We determined that a valuation allowance was appropriate for a portion of the deferred tax assets of our California research and development tax credits, foreign tax attributes and net operating losses and capital loss carryforwards at fiscal 2011 , 2010 and 2009 year-ends.
21510_11_ITEM15_P193_S3	During fiscal 2011 , we increased our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by $1.5 million to $8.8 million , primarily due to the reduced ability to utilize foreign tax attributes and net operating losses and the reduced ability to utilize California research and development tax credits as a result of releasing net unrecognized tax benefits under ASC 740-10 that supported the credits.
21510_11_ITEM15_P194_S0	The net deferred tax asset is classified on the consolidated balance sheets as follows (in thousands):
21510_11_ITEM15_P195_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 17.
21510_11_ITEM15_P196_S0	We have various tax attribute carryforwards which include the following:
21510_11_ITEM15_P197_S0	Foreign net operating loss carryforwards are $11.4 million , of which $9.3 million have no expiration date and of which $2.0 million will expire in fiscal years 2019 to 2030 .
21510_11_ITEM15_P197_S1	A valuation allowance totaling $11.2 million has been recorded against the foreign net operating loss carryforwards since the recovery of the carryforwards are uncertain.
21510_11_ITEM15_P198_S0	Federal capital loss carryforwards of $1.0 million which will expire in fiscal year 2012 to 2015 .
21510_11_ITEM15_P198_S1	State capital loss carryforwards of $1.0 million which will expire in fiscal 2012 to 2015 .
21510_11_ITEM15_P198_S2	Full valuation allowances have been recorded against the federal capital loss and the state capital loss carryforwards since the recovery of the carryforwards are uncertain.
21510_11_ITEM15_P199_S0	Federal R D credit carryforwards of $10.9 million which will expire in fiscal years 2025 to 2031 .
21510_11_ITEM15_P199_S1	California R D credit carryforwards of $15.1 million that have no expiration date.
21510_11_ITEM15_P199_S2	A valuation allowance totaling $4.4 million , net of federal benefit, has been recorded against California R D credit carryforwards since the recovery of the carryforwards are uncertain.
21510_11_ITEM15_P199_S3	Included in the net deferred tax asset balance is $0.5 million of deferred tax liabilities related to the currency translation adjustment.
21510_11_ITEM15_P199_S4	The associated tax expenses are recorded as a part of other comprehensive income.
21510_11_ITEM15_P200_S0	The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 ( Act ), was enacted on December 17, 2010.
21510_11_ITEM15_P200_S1	Under the Act, the federal research and development credit was retroactively extended for amounts paid or incurred after December 31, 2009 through December 31, 2011.
21510_11_ITEM15_P200_S2	The effects of the change in the tax law are recognized in our first quarter of fiscal 2011 , which is the quarter that the law was enacted.
21510_11_ITEM15_P201_S0	In addition to the federal legislation, the state of California approved its 2010-2011 budget on October 8, 2010 that includes modifications to the tax law provisions that were previously set to become effective with tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2011.
21510_11_ITEM15_P201_S1	Accordingly, we were able to benefit from additional research and development tax credits in fiscal year 2011 that were previously limited.
21510_11_ITEM15_P202_S0	We are subject to taxation and file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions.
21510_11_ITEM15_P202_S1	For U.S. federal income tax purposes, all years prior to 2005 are closed.
21510_11_ITEM15_P203_S0	The IRS audited the research and development credits generated in the years 1999 through 2001 and carried forward to future years.
21510_11_ITEM15_P203_S1	We received a notice of proposed adjustment ( NOPA ) from the IRS in October 2008 to decrease the amount of research and development credits generated in years 2000 and 2001.
21510_11_ITEM15_P203_S2	We signed a Closing Agreement with the IRS which allows additional research and development credits for the years 2000 and 2001, respectively.
21510_11_ITEM15_P203_S3	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 , the Joint Committee on Taxation approved this agreement.
21510_11_ITEM15_P203_S4	We provided adequate tax reserves for adjustments to these research and development credits for the years 2000 and 2001.
21510_11_ITEM15_P203_S5	This settlement resulted in the closure of U.S. federal statutes of limitations for years through 2004 and we released net unrecognized tax benefits under ASC 740-10 and related interest of approximately $9.7 million that affected the Company's effective tax rate for fiscal year 2011 .
21510_11_ITEM15_P203_S6	In our major state jurisdictions and our major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 2000 and 2004, respectively, currently remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities.
21510_11_ITEM15_P203_S7	We believe that we have provided adequate reserves for any adjustments that may be determined by the tax authorities.
21510_11_ITEM15_P203_S8	As of October 1, 2011 , the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $33.7 million , of which $19.7 million , if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate.

21510_11_ITEM15_P205_S1	Our total gross unrecognized tax benefit was classified as long-term taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheets.
21510_11_ITEM15_P205_S2	We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes.
21510_11_ITEM15_P205_S3	As of October 1, 2011 , the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $3.4 million , which is classified as long-term taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheets.
21510_11_ITEM15_P205_S4	As of October 2, 2010 , we had accrued $6.9 million for the gross interest and penalties relating to the gross unrecognized tax benefits.
21510_11_ITEM15_P205_S5	Management believes that it has adequately provided for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.
21510_11_ITEM15_P206_S0	The Company regularly engages in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions.
21510_11_ITEM15_P206_S1	It is reasonably possible that certain federal, foreign and state tax matters may be concluded in the next 12 months.
21510_11_ITEM15_P206_S2	The Company estimates that the net unrecognized tax benefits and related interest at October 1, 2011 could be reduced by approximately $1.0 million to $2.0 million in the next 12 months.
21510_11_ITEM15_P206_S3	A reconciliation of the change in gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, is as follows (in thousands):
21510_11_ITEM15_P207_S0	The decrease in liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits from $43.3 million to $30.3 million resulted in a reduction of $13.0 million in our gross uncertain tax positions.
21510_11_ITEM15_P207_S1	The IRS settlement resulted in the closure of U.S. federal statutes of limitations for years through 2004.
21510_11_ITEM15_P207_S2	The decrease in liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to the closure of U.S. federal statutes of limitations for years through 2004 is $12.2 million .
21510_11_ITEM15_P207_S3	We also recorded an offsetting reduction in deferred tax assets, primarily related to competent authority offsets for transfer pricing adjustments.
21510_11_ITEM15_P207_S4	As a result, the impact on our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 is $7.1 million excluding related interest.
21510_11_ITEM15_P207_S5	A summary of the fiscal tax years that remain subject to examination, as of October 1, 2011 , for our major tax jurisdictions is:
21510_11_ITEM15_P208_S0	SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION We are organized into two reportable operating segments: Commercial Lasers and Components ("CLC") and Specialty Lasers and Systems ("SLS").
21510_11_ITEM15_P209_S0	This segmentation reflects the go-to-market strategies for various products and markets.
21510_11_ITEM15_P209_S1	While both segments work to deliver cost-effective solutions, CLC focuses on higher volume products that are offered in set configurations.
21510_11_ITEM15_P209_S2	The product architectures are designed for easy exchange at the point of use such that product service and repairs are based upon advanced replacement and depot (i.e., factory) repair.

21510_11_ITEM15_P211_S0	SLS develops and manufacturers configurable, advanced-performance products largely serving the microelectronics and scientific research markets.
21510_11_ITEM15_P211_S1	The size and complexity of many of our SLS products require service to be performed at the customer site by factory-trained field service engineers.
21510_11_ITEM15_P212_S0	We have identified CLC and SLS as operating segments for which discrete financial information was available.
21510_11_ITEM15_P212_S1	Both units have dedicated engineering, manufacturing, product business management and product line management functions.
21510_11_ITEM15_P213_S0	A small portion of our outside revenue is attributable to projects and recently developed products for which a segment has not yet been determined.
21510_11_ITEM15_P214_S0	The associated direct and indirect costs are presented in the category of Corporate and other, along with other corporate costs as described below.

21510_11_ITEM15_P215_S2	As assets are not a measure used to assess the performance of the company by the CODM, asset information is not tracked or compiled by segment and is not available to be reported in our disclosures.
21510_11_ITEM15_P216_S0	Income (loss) from operations represents the sales less the cost of sales and direct operating expenses incurred within the operating segments as well as allocated expenses such as shared sales and manufacturing costs.
21510_11_ITEM15_P216_S1	We do not allocate to our operating segments certain operating expenses, which we manage separately at the corporate level.
21510_11_ITEM15_P216_S2	These unallocated costs include stock-based compensation, corporate functions (certain research and development, management, finance, legal and human resources) and are included in the results below under Corporate and other in the reconciliation of operating results.

21510_12_ITEM1_P1_S3	We are organized into two operating segments: Commercial Lasers and Components ("CLC") and Specialty Lasers and Systems ("SLS").
21510_12_ITEM1_P1_S4	This segmentation reflects the go-to-market strategies for various products and markets.
21510_12_ITEM1_P1_S5	While both segments deliver cost-effective photonics solutions, CLC focuses on higher volume products that are offered in set configurations.
21510_12_ITEM1_P1_S6	The product architectures are designed for easy exchange at the point of use such that substantially all product service and repairs are based upon advanced replacement and depot (i.e., factory) repair.
21510_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	CLC's primary markets include materials processing, original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") components and instrumentation and microelectronics.
21510_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	SLS develops and manufactures configurable, advanced performance products largely serving the microelectronics, scientific research and government programs and OEM components and instrumentation markets.
21510_12_ITEM1_P3_S1	The size and complexity of many of the SLS products require service to be performed at the customer site by factory-trained field service engineers.
21510_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	Income (loss) from operations is the measure of profit and loss that our chief operating decision maker ("CODM") uses to assess performance and make decisions.
21510_12_ITEM1_P4_S1	Income (loss) from operations represents the sales less the cost of sales and direct operating expenses incurred within the operating segments as well as allocated expenses such as shared sales and manufacturing costs.
21510_12_ITEM1_P4_S2	We do not allocate to our operating segments certain operating expenses, which we manage separately at the corporate level.
21510_12_ITEM1_P4_S3	These unallocated costs include stock-based compensation and corporate functions (certain advanced research and development, management, finance, legal and human resources) and are included in Corporate and other.
21510_12_ITEM1_P4_S4	Management does not consider unallocated Corporate and other costs in its measurement of segment performance.
21510_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	We were originally incorporated in California on May 26, 1966 and reincorporated in Delaware on October 1, 1990.
21510_12_ITEM1_P5_S1	Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and we are a member of the Standard Poor's SmallCap 600 Index and the Russell 2000 Index.

21510_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	A laser emits an intense coherent beam of light with some unique and highly useful properties.
21510_12_ITEM1_P7_S1	Most importantly, a laser is orders of magnitude brighter than any lamp.
21510_12_ITEM1_P7_S2	As a result of its coherence, the beam can be focused to a very small and intense spot, useful for applications requiring very high power densities including cutting and other materials processing procedures.
21510_12_ITEM1_P7_S3	The laser's high spatial resolution is also useful for microscopic imaging and inspection applications.
21510_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	Laser light can be monochromatic all the beam energy is confined to a narrow wavelength band.
21510_12_ITEM1_P8_S1	Some lasers can be used to create ultrafast output a series of pulses with pulse durations as short as attoseconds (i.e., 10 -18 seconds).
21510_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	There are many types of lasers and one way of classifying them is by the material or medium used to create the lasing action.
21510_12_ITEM1_P9_S1	This can be in the form of a gas, liquid, semiconductor, solid state crystal or fiber.
21510_12_ITEM1_P9_S2	Lasers can also be classified by their output wavelength: ultraviolet, visible, infrared or wavelength tunable.
21510_12_ITEM1_P9_S3	We manufacture all of these laser types.
21510_12_ITEM1_P9_S4	There are also many options in terms of pulsed output versus continuous wave, pulse duration, output power, beam dimensions, etc.
21510_12_ITEM1_P9_S5	In fact, each application has its specific requirements in terms of laser performance.
21510_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	to offer a diverse set of product lines characterized by lasers targeted at growth opportunities and key applications.
21510_12_ITEM1_P10_S1	In all cases, we aim to be the supplier of choice by offering a high-value combination of superior technical performance and high reliability.
21510_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	Photonics has taken its place alongside electronics as a critical enabling technology for the twenty-first century.
21510_12_ITEM1_P11_S1	Photonics based solutions are entrenched in a broad array of industries that include industrial automation, textile processing, microelectronics, flat panel displays and medical diagnostics, with adoption continuing in ever more diverse applications.
21510_12_ITEM1_P11_S2	Growth in these applications stems from two sources.
21510_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	First, there are many applications where the laser is displacing conventional technology because it can do the job faster, better or more economically.
21510_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	Second, there are new applications where the laser is the enabling tool that makes the work possible (e.g., the production of sub 50 micron microvias); these lasers are used in the manufacturing of high density printed circuit boards ("PCBs") found in the latest smart phones and tablet computers.
21510_12_ITEM1_P12_S2	Key laser applications include: semiconductor inspection; manufacturing of advanced PCBs; flat panel display manufacturing; solar cell production; medical and bio-instrumentation; materials processing; industrial process and quality control; marking; imaging and printing; graphic arts and display; and, research and development.
21510_12_ITEM1_P12_S3	For example, ultraviolet ( UV ) lasers are enabling the move towards miniaturization, which drives innovation and growth in many markets.
21510_12_ITEM1_P12_S4	In addition, the advent of industrial grade ultrafast lasers continues to open up new applications for laser processing.
21510_12_ITEM1_P12_S5	We strive to develop innovative and proprietary products and solutions that meet the needs of our customers and that are based on our core expertise in lasers and optical technologies.
21510_12_ITEM1_P12_S6	In pursuit of our strategy, we intend to:
21510_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	Leverage our technology portfolio and application engineering to lead the proliferation of photonics into broader markets We will continue to identify opportunities in which our technology portfolio and application engineering can be used to offer innovative solutions and gain access to new markets.
21510_12_ITEM1_P13_S1	We plan to utilize our expertise to increase our market share in the mid to high power material processing applications.
21510_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	Optimize our leadership position in existing markets There are a number of markets where we have historically been at the forefront of technological development and product deployment and from which we have derived a substantial portion of our revenues.
21510_12_ITEM1_P14_S1	We plan to optimize our financial returns from these markets.
21510_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	Maintain and develop additional strong collaborative customer and industry relationships We believe that the Coherent brand name and reputation for product quality, technical performance and customer satisfaction will help us to further develop our loyal customer base.
21510_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	We plan to maintain our current customer relationships and develop new ones with customers who are industry leaders and work together with these customers to design and develop innovative product systems and solutions as they develop new technologies.
21510_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	Develop and acquire new technologies and market share We will continue to enhance our market position through our existing technologies and develop new technologies through our internal research and development efforts, as well as through the acquisition of additional complementary technologies, intellectual property, manufacturing processes and product offerings.
21510_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	Streamline our manufacturing structure and improve our cost structure We will focus on optimizing the mix of products that we manufacture internally and externally.
21510_12_ITEM1_P17_S1	We will utilize vertical integration where our internal manufacturing process is considered proprietary and seek to leverage external sources when the capabilities and cost structure are well developed and on a path towards commoditization.
21510_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	Focus on long-term improvement of adjusted EBITDA, in dollars and as a percentage of net sales We define adjusted EBITDA as operating income adjusted for depreciation, amortization, stock compensation expenses, major restructuring costs and certain other non-operating income and expense items.
21510_12_ITEM1_P18_S1	Key initiatives to reach our goals for EBITDA improvements include utilization of our Asian manufacturing locations, rationalizing our supply chain and continued leveraging of our infrastructure.
21510_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	APPLICATIONS Our products address a broad range of applications that we group into the following markets: Microelectronics, Materials Processing, OEM Components and Instrumentation and Scientific Research and Government Programs.
21510_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	Microelectronics Nowhere is the trend towards miniaturization more prevalent than in the Microelectronics market where smart phones, tablets, ultrabooks, personal computers ("PC's") and televisions ("TV's") are driving advances in displays, integrated circuits and PCBs.
21510_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	In response to market demands and expectations, semiconductor and device manufacturers are continually seeking to improve their process and design technologies in order to manufacture smaller, more powerful and more reliable devices at lower cost.
21510_12_ITEM1_P21_S1	New laser applications and new laser technologies are a key element in delivering higher resolution and higher precision at lower manufacturing cost.
21510_12_ITEM1_P21_S2	We support three major markets in the microelectronics industry: (1) flat panel display ("FPDs") manufacturing, (2) advanced packaging and interconnects and (3) semiconductor front-end.
21510_12_ITEM1_P21_S3	Microelectronics flat panel display manufacturing The high-volume consumer market is driving the production of FPDs in applications such as mobile phones, tablets, ultrabooks, laptop computers, and TVs.
21510_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	There are several types of established and emerging displays based on quite different technologies, including liquid crystal ("LCD") and organic polymers ("OLED").
21510_12_ITEM1_P22_S1	Lasers have found applications in each of these technologies given that lasers provide higher process speed, better yield, improved battery life, lower cost and/or superior display brightness and resolution.
21510_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	Several display types require a high-density pattern of silicon thin film transistors ("TFTs").
21510_12_ITEM1_P23_S1	If this silicon is polycrystalline, the performance is greatly enhanced.
21510_12_ITEM1_P23_S2	In the past, these polysilicon layers could only be produced on expensive special glass at high temperatures.
21510_12_ITEM1_P23_S3	However, excimer-based processes, such as excimer laser annealing ("ELA") have allowed high-volume production of low-temperature polysilicon ("LTPS") on conventional glass substrates.
21510_12_ITEM1_P23_S4	Our excimer lasers provide an invaluable solution for LTPS because they are the only industrial-grade excimer lasers with the high pulse energy optimized for this application.
21510_12_ITEM1_P23_S5	The current state-of-the-art product for this application is our excimer VYPER laser, which delivers over 1000W of power, enabling customers to scale to current Generation 5 5.5 substrates all the way up to Generation 8 sizes.
21510_12_ITEM1_P23_S6	These systems are integral to the manufacturing process on all leading LTPS-based smart phone displays, with the highest commercially available pixel densities of greater than 300 pixels per inch (ppi) and hold the potential for deployment in tablet display and OLED TV manufacturing.
21510_12_ITEM1_P23_S7	Our AVIA and DIAMOND lasers are also used in other production processes for FPDs.
21510_12_ITEM1_P23_S8	These processes include drilling, cutting, patterning, marking and yield improvement.
21510_12_ITEM1_P23_S9	Lasers have also become a valuable tool in high-brightness ("HB") LED manufacturing, improving LED performance and yield.
21510_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	LED has seen rapid growth in the last year due to widespread adoption as the light source in all categories of LCD displays, from phones all the way to full size TVs.
21510_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	Our lasers are used in the back-end processing of HB-LEDs.
21510_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	Microelectronics advanced packaging and interconnects After a wafer is patterned, there are then a host of other processes, referred to as back-end processing, which finally result in a packaged encapsulated silicon chip.
21510_12_ITEM1_P26_S1	Ultimately, these chips are then assembled into finished products.
21510_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	The advent of high-speed logic and high-memory content devices has caused chip manufacturers to look for alternative technologies to improve performance and lower process costs.
21510_12_ITEM1_P27_S1	In terms of materials, this search includes new types of materials, such as low-k and thinner silicon.
21510_12_ITEM1_P27_S2	Our AVIA, Talisker and Matrix lasers are providing economical methods of cutting and scribing these wafers while delivering higher yields than traditional mechanical methods.
21510_12_ITEM1_P27_S3	There are similar trends in chip packaging and PCB manufacturing requiring more compact packaging and denser interconnects.
21510_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	In many cases, lasers present enabling technologies.
21510_12_ITEM1_P28_S1	For instance, lasers are now the only economically practical method for drilling microvias in chip assemblies and in both rigid and flexible PCBs.
21510_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	These microvias are tiny interconnects that are essential for enabling high-density circuitry commonly used in smart phones, tablets and advanced computing systems.
21510_12_ITEM1_P29_S1	Our DIAMOND carbon dioxide ("CO 2 ") and AVIA DPSS lasers are the lasers of choice in this application.
21510_12_ITEM1_P29_S2	The ability of these lasers to operate at very high repetition rates translates into faster drilling speeds and increased throughput in microvia processing applications.
21510_12_ITEM1_P29_S3	In addition, multi-layer circuit boards require more flexible production methods than conventional printing technologies can offer, which has led to widespread adoption of Laser Direct Imaging.
21510_12_ITEM1_P29_S4	Our Paladin laser is used for this application.
21510_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	The term "front-end" refers to the production of semiconductor devices which occurs prior to packaging.
21510_12_ITEM1_P30_S1	As semiconductor device geometries decrease in size, devices become increasingly susceptible to smaller defects during each phase of the manufacturing process and these defects can negatively impact yield.
21510_12_ITEM1_P31_S0	One of the semiconductor industry's responses to the increasing vulnerability of semiconductor devices to smaller defects has been to use defect detection and inspection techniques that are closely linked to the manufacturing process.
21510_12_ITEM1_P31_S1	For example, automated laser-based inspection systems are now used to detect and locate defects as small as 0.01 micron, which may not be observable by conventional optical microscopes.
21510_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	Detecting the presence of defects is only the first step in preventing their recurrence.
21510_12_ITEM1_P32_S1	After detection, defects must be examined in order to identify their size, shape and the process step in which the defect occurred.
21510_12_ITEM1_P32_S2	This examination is called defect classification.
21510_12_ITEM1_P32_S3	Identification of the sources of defects in the lengthy and complex semiconductor manufacturing process has become essential for maintaining high yield production.
21510_12_ITEM1_P32_S4	Semiconductor manufacturing has become an around-the-clock operation and it is important for products used for inspection, measurement and testing to be reliable and to have long lifetimes.
21510_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	Our Azure, Paladin and Excimer lasers are used to detect and characterize defects in semiconductor chips.
21510_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	Materials Processing Lasers are widely accepted today in many important industrial manufacturing applications including cutting, welding, joining, drilling, perforating, and marking of metals and nonmetals.
21510_12_ITEM1_P34_S1	We supply high-power lasers for metal processing and low-to-medium power lasers for laser marking, nonmetals processing and precision micromachining.
21510_12_ITEM1_P34_S2	Our high power industrial laser systems are used for cutting, cladding and hardening of metals, joining materials, and other materials processing applications.
21510_12_ITEM1_P34_S3	Other applications include welding of plastics and direct metal welding.
21510_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	Our Semiconductor business provides higher power arrays with powers in excess of 50 kilowatts through its proprietary cooling and stacking technology.
21510_12_ITEM1_P35_S1	This unique technology provides the engine for both our Highlight direct diode systems as well as our kW class fiber laser.
21510_12_ITEM1_P35_S2	Complementing our high power solid state lasers is our industry leading DIAMOND E1000 CO 2 laser.
21510_12_ITEM1_P35_S3	Introduced in 2009, this laser remains in high demand due to its high power, small size and completely sealed design - all ideal for material processing.
21510_12_ITEM1_P35_S4	Combining the high power Direct Diode, Fiber and CO 2 offerings with our MetaBeam 1000 flatbed cutting tool provides a strong, compelling four-pronged approach to meeting the needs of our diverse materials processing customers.
21510_12_ITEM1_P35_S5	The new METABEAM 1000 offers the industry's most compact 1kW tool, with tool footprints at least 50% smaller than competitive designs.
21510_12_ITEM1_P35_S6	Operating costs, due to a combination of input power efficiencies and the sealed nature of the DIAMOND series of CO 2 lasers, are 50% less than similar, but larger tools.
21510_12_ITEM1_P35_S7	We also participate in the low to medium power area, including such applications as the cutting, drilling and joining of a host of materials using our DIAMOND CO 2 lasers; Highlight FAP semiconductor lasers in OEM opportunities and direct end user applications with the lower power OMNIBEAM and METABEAM cutting tools; applications including cutting, perforating and scoring of paper, thin metals and packaging materials; and various cutting and patterning applications in the textile, wood and sign industries.
21510_12_ITEM1_P35_S8	In the specific area of textiles and clothing, our DIAMOND lasers service older applications, such as cutting complex shapes in leather for footwear, as well as newer applications such as creating detailed fade patterns on designer denims.
21510_12_ITEM1_P35_S9	Laser marking and coding are generally considered part of the precision materials processing applications market for which we remain a leading supplier.
21510_12_ITEM1_P35_S10	One such area where applications are growing rapidly is the displacement of ink-jet coding due to both aesthetic and environmental pressures.
21510_12_ITEM1_P36_S0	The optimum choice of laser depends on the material being marked, whether it is a surface mark (engraved) or a sub-surface mark, and the specific economics of the application.
21510_12_ITEM1_P37_S0	Our DIAMOND C and GEM Series of CO 2 lasers provide many systems manufacturers with a reliable cost effective source for marking and engraving on non-metals.
21510_12_ITEM1_P37_S1	In addition, our Matrix product line of reliable, compact and low-cost diode pumped solid state lasers provides an ideal solution for marking of other materials in high volume manufacturing.
21510_12_ITEM1_P38_S0	OEM components and instrumentation Instrumentation is one of our more mature commercial applications.
21510_12_ITEM1_P38_S1	Representative applications within this market include bio-instrumentation, medical OEMs, graphic arts and display and machine vision.
21510_12_ITEM1_P38_S2	We also support the laser-based instrumentation market with a range of laser-related components, including diode lasers for optical pumping.
21510_12_ITEM1_P38_S3	Some of our OEM component business includes sales to other, less integrated laser manufacturers participating in OEM markets such as materials processing, scientific, and medical.
21510_12_ITEM1_P39_S0	Bio-instrumentation applications for lasers include bio-agent detection for point source and standoff detection of pathogens or other bio-toxins; confocal microscopy for biological imaging that allows researchers and clinicians to visualize cellular and subcellular structures and processes with an incredible amount of detail; DNA sequencing that provides automation and data acquisition rates that would be impossible by any other method; drug discovery genomic and proteomic analyses that enable drug discovery to proceed at very high throughput rates; and flow cytometry for analyzing single cells or populations of cells in a heterogeneous mixture, including blood samples.
21510_12_ITEM1_P39_S1	Specifically, our OBIS, Sapphire, Compass and Coherent CUBE lasers are used in several bio-instrumentation applications.
21510_12_ITEM1_P40_S0	Medical Therapy We sell a variety of components and lasers to medical laser companies in end-user applications such as ophthalmology, aesthetic, surgical, therapeutic and dentistry.
21510_12_ITEM1_P40_S1	Our DIAMOND series CO 2 lasers are widely used in ophthalmic, aesthetic and surgical markets.
21510_12_ITEM1_P40_S2	In addition, we have a leading position in Lasik and photorefractive keratectomy ("PRK") surgery methods with our ExciStar XS excimer laser platform.
21510_12_ITEM1_P41_S0	The unique ability of our optically pumped semiconductor lasers ("OPSL") technology to match a wavelength to an application has led to the development of a high-power yellow (577nm) laser for the treatment of eye related diseases, such as Age Related Macular Degeneration and retinal diseases associated with diabetes.
21510_12_ITEM1_P41_S1	The 577nm wavelength was designed to match the peak in absorption of oxygenated hemoglobin thereby allowing treatment to occur at a lower power level, and thus reducing stress and heat-load placed on the eye with traditional green-based (530nm) solid state lasers.
21510_12_ITEM1_P41_S2	Other applications where our OBIS, Genesis and Sapphire series of lasers are used include the retinal scanning market in diagnostic imaging systems as well as new ground breaking in-vivo imaging.
21510_12_ITEM1_P42_S0	Scientific research and government programs We are widely recognized as a technology innovator and the scientific market has historically provided an ideal "test market" for our leading-edge innovations.
21510_12_ITEM1_P42_S1	These have included ultrafast lasers, DPSS lasers, continuous-wave ("CW") systems, excimer gas lasers and water-cooled ion gas lasers.
21510_12_ITEM1_P42_S2	Our portfolio of lasers that address the scientific research market is broad and includes our Chameleon, COMPexPro, Evolution, Legend, Libra, MBD, MBR, Vitara, Mira and Verdi lasers.
21510_12_ITEM1_P42_S3	Many of the innovations and products pioneered in the scientific marketplace have become commercial successes for both our OEM customers and us.
21510_12_ITEM1_P42_S4	We have a large installed base of scientific lasers which are used in a wide range of applications spanning virtually every branch of science and engineering.
21510_12_ITEM1_P42_S5	These applications include biology and life science, engineering, physical chemistry and physics.
21510_12_ITEM1_P42_S6	Most of these applications require the use of ultrafast lasers that enable the generation of pulses short enough to be measured in femto- or attoseconds (10 -15 to 10 -18 seconds).
21510_12_ITEM1_P42_S7	Because of these very short pulse durations, ultrafast lasers enable the study of fundamental physical and chemical processes with temporal resolution unachievable with any other tool.
21510_12_ITEM1_P42_S8	These lasers also deliver very high peak power and large bandwidths, which can be used to generate many exotic effects.
21510_12_ITEM1_P42_S9	Some of these are now finding their way into mainstream applications, such as microscopy or materials processing.
21510_12_ITEM1_P42_S10	In fact, the use of ultrafast lasers such as the Chameleon in microscopy is now a common occurrence in bio-imaging labs.
21510_12_ITEM1_P42_S11	FUTURE TRENDS Microelectronics Lasers are widely used in mass production microelectronics applications largely because they enable entirely new application capabilities that cannot be realized by any other known means.
21510_12_ITEM1_P42_S12	These laser-based fabrication and testing methods provide a level of precision, typically on a micrometer and nanometer level, that are unique, faster, are touch free, deliver superior end products, increase yields, and/or cut production costs.
21510_12_ITEM1_P42_S13	We anticipate this trend to continue, driven primarily by the increasing sophistication of consumer electronic goods and their convergence via the internet, resulting in increasing demand for better displays, more bandwidth and memory, and all packaged into devices which are lighter, thinner and consume less power.
21510_12_ITEM1_P42_S14	Although this market follows the macro-economic trends and carries inherent risks, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to capitalize on the current market trends and that we will see continued increased adoption of our solid-state, CO 2 , pulsed fiber, direct diode and excimer lasers, as all these lasers enable entirely new applications, performance improvements and reduced process costs.
21510_12_ITEM1_P43_S0	LTPS-based high resolution mobile displays (greater than 300ppi), and especially the emergence of OLED technology, is evolving as the prevalent FPD technology.
21510_12_ITEM1_P43_S1	We believe we are well positioned, especially with our Vyper Excimer lasers and LB optical systems, to take advantage of this trend, including the possibility of LTPS-based OLED TVs.
21510_12_ITEM1_P43_S2	CO 2 , Avia, Talisker and direct diode lasers all seem aligned with the need for related FPD touch panel, film cutting, light guide technology, repair, frit welding and glass cutting applications.
21510_12_ITEM1_P44_S0	Semiconductor devices look set to continue Moore's Law, shrinking device geometries for at least another decade, as well as expanding vertically into new 3D structures.
21510_12_ITEM1_P44_S1	As a result we believe our many UV laser sources (such as Paladin, Avia, Talisker, ExiStar and Matrix) will continue to find increasing adoption, since their unique optical properties align well with the process demands of a nanometer scale world.
21510_12_ITEM1_P44_S2	The same lasers plus CO 2 are also widely adopted for back end Advanced Packaging and Interconnect (API) applications.
21510_12_ITEM1_P44_S3	With dimension roadmaps showing a decade of dimension shrink on PCBs, interconnects, Silicon LED scribe widths and glass thickness, we believe that our portfolio of lasers aligns well with these demands as well as new processes that seem likely to be enabled by our lasers, to meet the increasing demands and decreasing tolerances of these markets.
21510_12_ITEM1_P44_S4	Materials processing The market for low to medium power CO 2 , solid state and semiconductor lasers used in industrial materials processing has experienced a nice rebound and is expected to see continued growth driven by wider adoption of lasers in new processes especially in emerging markets.
21510_12_ITEM1_P44_S5	Key design wins as well as more favorable markets continue to support our growth in this area.
21510_12_ITEM1_P45_S0	These lasers represent a cost-effective manufacturing solution for cutting, joining, marking and engraving of non-metal materials including marking/coding, flat bed cutting, engraving, as well as the production of capital equipment for apparel and leather goods manufacturing.

21510_12_ITEM1_P57_S0	Fiber lasers Fiber lasers use semiconductor lasers to pump a doped optical fiber to produce a laser beam.
21510_12_ITEM1_P57_S1	The unique features of a fiber laser make them suitable for producing high power, continuous wave laser beams.
21510_12_ITEM1_P57_S2	We have introduced a 1 kilowatt fiber laser.
21510_12_ITEM1_P57_S3	Our fiber laser design has several unique features including a modular design for improved serviceability and diode bar based pumping.
21510_12_ITEM1_P57_S4	Due to packaging efficiency, diode bars reduce the overall cost of a fiber laser.
21510_12_ITEM1_P58_S0	Some of the most critical components inside a fiber laser include the gain fiber itself and the diodes providing the pump power.
21510_12_ITEM1_P58_S1	We are well positioned as a fiber laser supplier since we are vertically integrated with respect to these key technologies; we use diode bars and fiber manufactured in-house.
21510_12_ITEM1_P58_S2	We plan to continue to drive cost reduction in our diode laser pumps and demonstrate the scalability of the platform by moving up the power scale into the multi kilowatt regime.
21510_12_ITEM1_P58_S3	This platform will address the growing high power metal cutting and joining market.
21510_12_ITEM1_P59_S0	Gas lasers (CO 2 , Excimer, Ion) The breadth of our gas laser portfolio is industry leading, encompassing CO 2 , excimer and ion laser technologies.
21510_12_ITEM1_P60_S0	Gas lasers derive their name from the use of one or more gases as a lasing medium.
21510_12_ITEM1_P60_S1	They collectively span an extremely diverse and useful emission range, from the very deep ultraviolet to the far infrared.
21510_12_ITEM1_P60_S2	This diverse range of available wavelengths, coupled with high optical output power, and an abundance of other attractive characteristics, makes gas lasers extremely useful and popular for a variety of microelectronics, scientific, medical therapeutic and materials processing applications.
21510_12_ITEM1_P61_S0	Our OPSL platform is a surface emitting semiconductor laser that is energized or pumped by a semiconductor laser.
21510_12_ITEM1_P61_S1	The use of optical pumping circumvents inherent power scaling limitations of electrically pumped lasers, enabling very high powered devices.
21510_12_ITEM1_P61_S2	A wide range of wavelengths can be achieved by varying the semiconductor materials used in the device and changing the frequency of the laser beam using techniques common in solid state lasers.
21510_12_ITEM1_P61_S3	The platform leverages high reliability technologies developed for telecommunications and produces a compact, rugged, high power, single-mode laser.
21510_12_ITEM1_P61_S4	Our OPSL products are well suited to a wide range of applications, including the bio-instrumentation, medical therapeutics and graphic arts and display markets.

21510_12_ITEM1_P65_S0	Lasers Ultrafast lasers are lasers generating light pulses with durations of a few femtoseconds (10 -15 seconds) to a few tens of picoseconds (10 -11 seconds).
21510_12_ITEM1_P65_S1	These types of lasers are primarily used for scientific research and also are finding use in sophisticated materials processing applications.
21510_12_ITEM1_P65_S2	Ultrafast lasers are usually pumped by a green DPSS laser.
21510_12_ITEM1_P66_S0	UF laser oscillators generate a train of pulses at 50-100 MHz, with peak powers of tens of kilowatts, and UF laser amplifiers generate pulses at 1-10 kHz, with peak powers up to several Terawatts.
21510_12_ITEM1_P66_S1	The extremely short duration of UF laser pulses enables temporally resolving fast events like the dynamics of atoms or electrons.
21510_12_ITEM1_P66_S2	In addition, the high peak power enables so-called non-linear effects where several photons can be absorbed by a molecule at the same time.
21510_12_ITEM1_P66_S3	This type of process enables applications like multi-photon excitation microscopy or UF ablation of materials with minimal thermal damage.

21510_12_ITEM1_P87_S0	The fiscal 2010 severance related costs were primarily comprised of severance pay, outplacement services, medical and other related benefits for employees being terminated due to the transition of activities out of Montreal, Canada, and Tampere, Finland.
21510_12_ITEM1_P87_S1	The fiscal 2011 severance related costs were primarily comprised of severance pay, outplacement services, medical and other related benefits for employees being terminated due to the transition of activities out of Tampere, Finland.
21510_12_ITEM1_P88_S0	During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we announced our plans to close our facilities in Tampere, Finland and St. Louis, Missouri.
21510_12_ITEM1_P88_S1	The closure of our St. Louis, Missouri and Yokohama, Japan sites were completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.
21510_12_ITEM1_P88_S2	The closure of our Finland site was scheduled for completion by the end of fiscal 2010, but we decided to delay the closure due to increased demand for products manufactured in Finland.
21510_12_ITEM1_P88_S3	In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we ceased manufacturing operations in our Finland facility and we exited the facility in the third quarter of fiscal 2011.
21510_12_ITEM1_P88_S4	These closure plans resulted in charges primarily for employee termination and other exit related costs associated with a plan approved by management.
21510_12_ITEM1_P88_S5	We completed the last restructuring activities under these plans during fiscal 2012.
21510_12_ITEM1_P89_S0	Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local environmental protection regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials, chemicals, various radioactive materials and certain waste products.
21510_12_ITEM1_P90_S0	In the United States, we are subject to the federal regulation and control of the Environmental Protection Agency.
21510_12_ITEM1_P90_S1	Comparable authorities are involved in other countries.
21510_12_ITEM1_P91_S0	We believe that compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive and financial position.
21510_12_ITEM1_P91_S1	Although we believe that our safety procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of such materials comply with the standards required by federal and state laws and regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials.
21510_12_ITEM1_P91_S2	In the event of such an accident involving such materials, we could be liable for damages and such liability could exceed the amount of our liability insurance coverage and the resources of our business.
21510_12_ITEM1_P92_S0	We may face potentially increasing complexity in our product designs and procurement operations as we adjust to requirements relating to the materials composition of products entering specific markets.
21510_12_ITEM1_P92_S1	Such regulations went into effect in the European Union ("EU") in 2006, and China in 2007.
21510_12_ITEM1_P93_S0	We could face significant costs and liabilities in connection with product take-back legislation.
21510_12_ITEM1_P94_S0	Beginning in 2006, the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive made producers of electrical goods financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products.
21510_12_ITEM1_P94_S1	In addition, the EU has added the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals Regulation, otherwise known as the REACH Regulation, which further regulates substances and products imported, manufactured or sold within the EU.
21510_12_ITEM1_P94_S2	Similar laws are now pending in various jurisdictions around the world, including the United States.
21510_12_ITEM1_P95_S0	We are organized into two operating segments: Commercial Lasers and Components ("CLC") and Specialty Lasers and Systems ("SLS").
21510_12_ITEM1_P95_S1	This segmentation reflects the go-to-market strategies for various products and markets.
21510_12_ITEM1_P95_S2	While both segments work to deliver cost-effective photonics solutions, CLC focuses on higher volume products that are offered in set configurations.
21510_12_ITEM1_P95_S3	The product architectures are designed for easy exchange at the point of use such that product service and repairs are based upon advanced replacement and depot (i.e., factory) repair.
21510_12_ITEM1_P96_S0	CLC's primary markets include materials processing, OEM components and instrumentation and microelectronics.
21510_12_ITEM1_P97_S0	SLS develops and manufacturers configurable, advanced-performance products largely serving the microelectronics, scientific research and government programs and OEM components and instrumentation markets.
21510_12_ITEM1_P97_S1	The size and complexity of many of the SLS products require service to be performed at the customer site by factory-trained field service engineers.
21510_12_ITEM1_P98_S0	We have identified CLC and SLS as operating segments for which discrete financial information was available.
21510_12_ITEM1_P98_S1	Both units have dedicated engineering, manufacturing, product business management and product line management functions.
21510_12_ITEM1_P99_S0	The associated direct and indirect costs are presented in the category of Corporate and other, along with other corporate costs.
21510_12_ITEM1_P100_S0	FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND EXPORT SALES Financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations for fiscal years 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , is set forth in Note 18, "Segment and Geographic Information" of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of this annual report.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	You should carefully consider the followings risks when considering an investment in our Common Stock.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These risks could materially affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, cause the trading price of our Common Stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P0_S2	These risks are not exclusive, and additional risks to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, the factors mentioned under Forward-Looking Statements and the risk of our businesses described elsewhere in this annual report.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Additionally, these risks and uncertainties described herein are not the only ones facing us.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our business, results of operations or financial conditions.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our operating results, including net sales, net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA in dollars and as a percentage of net sales, as well as our stock price have varied in the past, and our future operating results will continue to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations based upon numerous factors, including those discussed in this Item 1A and throughout this report.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our stock price will continue to be subject to daily variations as well.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Our future operating results and stock price may not follow any past trends or meet our guidance and expectations.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our net sales and operating results, such as adjusted EBITDA percentage, net income (loss) and operating expenses, and our stock price have varied in the past and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year in the future.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We believe a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, could cause these variations and make them difficult to predict, including:
21510_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	distraction of management related to acquisition or divestment activities.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In addition, we often recognize a substantial portion of our sales in the last month of our fiscal quarters.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Our expenses for any given quarter are typically based on expected sales and if sales are below expectations in any given quarter, the adverse impact of the shortfall on our operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We also base our manufacturing on our forecasted product mix for the quarter.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P4_S3	If the actual product mix varies significantly from our forecast, we may not be able to fill some orders during that quarter, which would result in delays in the shipment of our products.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Accordingly, variations in timing of sales, particularly for our higher priced, higher margin products, can cause significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Due to these and other factors, such as varying product mix, we believe that quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year comparisons of our historical operating results may not be meaningful.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	You should not rely on our results for any quarter or year as an indication of our future performance.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Our operating results in future quarters and years may be below public market analysts' or investors' expectations, which would likely cause the price of our stock to fall.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P5_S3	In addition, over the past several years, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the stock prices of many technology companies both in and outside our industry.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P5_S4	There has not always been a direct correlation between this volatility and the performance of particular companies subject to these stock price fluctuations.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P5_S5	Further, over the last twelve months, equity markets around the world have significantly fluctuated across most sectors.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P5_S6	These factors, as well as general economic and political conditions or investors' concerns regarding the credibility of corporate financial statements, may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our stock in the future.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We are exposed to risks associated with worldwide economic conditions and related uncertainties which could negatively impact demand for our products and results of operations.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets, depressed consumer confidence, government economic policies, negative economic conditions, volatile corporate profits and reduced capital spending could negatively impact demand for our products.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	In particular, it is difficult to develop and implement strategy, sustainable business models and efficient operations, as well as effectively manage supply chain relationships in the face of such conditions including uncertainty regarding the ability of some of our suppliers to continue operations and provide us with uninterrupted supply flow.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Our ability to maintain our research and development investments in our broad product offerings may be adversely impacted in the event that our sales decline and do not increase in the future.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Spending and the timing thereof by consumers and businesses has a significant impact on our results and, where such spending is delayed or canceled, it could have a material negative impact on our operating results.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The current global economic conditions remain uncertain and challenging.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Weakness in our end markets could negatively impact our revenue, gross margin and operating expenses, and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	In the United States, uncertainty over U.S. fiscal policy, including the potential for the so-called fiscal cliff has likely had a recent adverse impact on U.S. financial markets and overall economic activity.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The fiscal cliff refers to a series of tax increases and government spending reductions that will automatically occur at the end of 2012 in the absence of Congressional action to delay or offset these actions.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If ultimately realized, the fiscal cliff would likely negatively impact global economic activity, including possibly sending the U.S. into a new recession.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P10_S2	It would also likely have negative repercussions on U.S. and global credit and financial markets, and further exacerbate sovereign debt concerns in the European Union.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P10_S3	All of these factors would likely adversely impact the global demand for our products and the performance of our investments, and would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The financial turmoil which recently affected the banking system and financial markets continues to negatively impact financial institutions and has resulted in tighter credit markets, and lower levels of liquidity in some financial markets.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	There could be a number of follow-on effects from the tightened credit environment on our business, including the insolvency of key suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and/or manufacture products resulting in product delays; inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and/or customer insolvencies; and failure of financial institutions negatively impacting our treasury functions.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P11_S2	In the event our customers are unable to obtain credit or otherwise pay for our shipped products it could significantly impact our ability to collect on our outstanding accounts receivable.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments; impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments; interest rates; cash balances; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Volatility in the financial markets and any overall economic uncertainty increase the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Uncertainty about current global economic conditions could also continue to increase the volatility of our stock price.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	In addition, political and social turmoil related to international conflicts, terrorist acts and civil unrest may put further pressure on economic conditions in the United States and abroad.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	difficult for our customers, our suppliers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	If such conditions persist, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Additionally, unstable economic conditions can provide significant pressures and burdens on individuals, which could cause them to engage in inappropriate business conduct.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P13_S3	See Part II, Item 4A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES-Inherent Limitations over Internal Control.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We depend on sole source or limited source suppliers, both internal and external, for some of our key components and materials, including exotic materials, certain cutting-edge optics and crystals, in our products, which make us susceptible to supply shortages or price fluctuations that could adversely affect our business.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We currently purchase several key components and materials used in the manufacture of our products from sole source or limited source suppliers, both internal and external.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Our failure to timely receive these key components and materials, such as the large optics used in our flat panel display manufacturing applications, could cause delays in the shipment of our products.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Some of these suppliers are relatively small private companies that may discontinue their operations at any time and which may be particularly susceptible to prevailing economic conditions.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Some of our suppliers are located in regions which may be susceptible to natural disasters, such as last year's flooding in Thailand and the earthquake, tsunami and resulting nuclear disaster in Japan and this year's severe flooding and power loss in the Eastern part of the United States.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P15_S4	We typically purchase our components and materials through purchase orders or agreed upon terms and conditions and we do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with many of these suppliers.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Some of our products, particularly in the flat panel display industry, require designs and specifications which are at the cutting-edge of available technologies.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Our and our customers' designs and specifications frequently change to meet rapidly evolving market demands.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P15_S7	Accordingly certain of our products require components and supplies which may be technologically difficult and unpredictable to manufacture.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P15_S8	These characteristics further pressure the timely delivery of such components.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P15_S9	We may fail to obtain these supplies in a timely manner in the future.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P15_S10	We may experience difficulty identifying alternative sources of supply for certain components used in our products and may have to incur expenses and management distraction in assisting our current and future suppliers to meet our and our customers' technical requirements.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P15_S11	We would experience further delays while identifying, evaluating and testing the products of these potential alternative suppliers.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P15_S12	Furthermore, financial or other difficulties faced by these suppliers or significant changes in demand for these components or materials could limit their availability.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P15_S13	We continue to consolidate our supply base and move supplier locations.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P15_S14	When we transition locations we may increase our inventory of such products as a safety stock during the transition, which may cause the amount of inventory reflected on our balance sheet to increase.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P15_S15	Additionally, many of our customers rely on sole source suppliers.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P15_S16	In the event of a disruption of our customers' supply chain, orders from our customers could decrease or be delayed.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these components or materials, or the inability to obtain these components and materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time, or our failure to properly manage these moves, would impair our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and could cause customers to cancel orders.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We have historically relied exclusively on our own production capability to manufacture certain strategic components, crystals, semiconductor lasers, lasers and laser-based systems.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Because we manufacture, package and test these components, products and systems at our own facilities, and such components, products and systems are not readily available from other sources, any interruption in manufacturing would adversely affect our business.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P17_S2	In addition, our failure to achieve adequate manufacturing yields of these items at our manufacturing facilities may materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We participate in the microelectronics market, which requires significant research and development expenses to develop and maintain products and a failure to achieve market acceptance for our products could have a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The microelectronics market is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product introductions, the volatility of product supply and demand, changing customer requirements and evolving industry standards.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The nature of this market requires significant research and development expenses to participate, with substantial resources invested in advance of material sales of our products to our customers in this market.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Additionally, our product offerings may become obsolete given the frequent introduction of alternative technologies.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P19_S3	In the event either our customers' or our products fail to gain market acceptance, or the microelectronics market fails to grow, it would likely have a significant negative effect on our business and results of operations.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We participate in the flat panel display market, which has a relatively limited number of end customer manufacturers.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Our backlog, timing of revenues and results of operations could be negatively impacted in the event our customers reschedule orders.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	In the flat panel display market, there are a relatively limited number of manufacturers who are the end customers for our annealing products.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Given macroeconomic conditions, varying consumer demand and technical process limitations at manufacturers, our customers may seek to reschedule or cancel orders.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Challenges in meeting evolving technological requirements for these complex products by us and our suppliers could also result in delays in shipments, rescheduled or canceled orders by our customers.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P21_S3	This could negatively impact our backlog, timing of revenues and results of operations.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Some of our laser systems are complex in design and may contain defects that are not detected until deployed by our customers, which could increase our costs and reduce our revenues.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Lasers and laser systems are inherently complex in design and require ongoing regular maintenance.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The manufacture of our lasers, laser products and systems involves a highly complex and precise process.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P23_S2	As a result of the technological complexity of our products, in particular the flat panel annealing systems, changes in our or our suppliers' manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective materials by us or our suppliers could result in a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and product reliability.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P23_S3	To the extent that we do not achieve and maintain our projected yields or product reliability, our business, operating results, financial condition and customer relationships would be adversely affected.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P23_S4	We provide warranties on a majority of our product sales, and reserves for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P23_S5	The determination of such reserves requires us to make estimates of failure rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P23_S6	We typically establish warranty reserves based on historical warranty costs for each product line.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P23_S7	If actual return rates and/or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates, adjustments to cost of sales may be required in future periods which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated under the end user's peak stress conditions.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P24_S1	In addition, some of our products are combined with products from other vendors, which may contain defects.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P24_S2	As a result, should problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P24_S3	If we are unable to identify and fix defects or other problems, we could experience, among other things:
21510_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	legal actions by our customers and/or their end users.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Continued volatility in the semiconductor manufacturing industry could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	A portion of our net sales in the microelectronics market depend on the demand for our products by semiconductor equipment companies.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The semiconductor market has historically been characterized by sudden and severe cyclical variations in product supply and demand, which have often severely affected the demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment, including laser-based tools and systems.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The timing, severity and duration of these market cycles are difficult to predict, and we may not be able to respond effectively to these cycles.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P29_S2	The continuing uncertainty in this market severely limits our ability to predict our business prospects or financial results in this market.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	During industry downturns, our revenues from this market may decline suddenly and significantly.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Our ability to rapidly and effectively reduce our cost structure in response to such downturns is limited by the fixed nature of many of our expenses in the near term and by our need to continue our investment in next-generation product technology and to support and service our products.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P30_S2	In addition, due to the relatively long manufacturing lead times for some of the systems and subsystems we sell to this market, we may incur expenditures or purchase raw materials or components for products we cannot sell.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Accordingly, downturns in the semiconductor capital equipment market may materially harm our operating results.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	in customer demand that may be extremely rapid, and if we fail to do so we may lose business to our competitors and our relationships with our customers may be harmed.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are managed through various banks around the world and volatility in the capital and credit market conditions could cause financial institutions to fail or materially harm service levels provided by such banks, both of which could have an adverse affect on our ability to timely access funds.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	World capital and credit markets have been and may continue to experience volatility and disruption.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P33_S1	In some cases, the markets have exerted downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers, as well as pressured the solvency of some financial institutions.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P33_S2	These financial institutions, including banks, have had difficulty timely performing regular services and in some cases have failed or otherwise been largely taken over by governments.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We maintain our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments with a number of financial institutions around the world.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Should some or all of these financial institutions fail or otherwise be unable to timely perform requested services, we would likely have a limited ability to timely access our cash deposited with such institutions, or, in extreme circumstances the failure of such institutions could cause us to be unable to access cash for the foreseeable future.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P34_S2	If we are unable to quickly access our funds when we need them, we may need to increase the use of our existing credit lines or access more expensive credit, if available.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P34_S3	If we are unable to access our cash or if we access existing or additional credit or are unable to access additional credit, it could have a negative impact on our operations, including our reported net income.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We are exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Although we have not recognized any material losses on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, future declines in their market values could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Given the global nature of our business, we have investments both domestically and internationally.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	There has recently been growing pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, particularly in Europe where a significant portion of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are invested, which results in corresponding pressure on the valuation of the securities issued by such nations.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Additionally, our overall investment portfolio is often concentrated in certificates of deposit and money market funds.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P38_S2	We maintain a mix of government-issued securities.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, financial results, or other factors.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Additionally, liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations could result in decreased values for our investments in certain government securities.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P38_S5	As a result, the value or liquidity of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments could decline or become materially impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P38_S6	See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to increase our sales volumes and decrease our costs to offset potential declines in the average selling prices ( ASPs ) of our products and, if we are unable to realize greater sales volumes and lower costs, our operating results may suffer.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our ability to increase our sales volume and our future success depends on the continued growth of the markets for lasers, laser systems and related accessories, as well as our ability to identify, in advance, emerging markets for laser-based systems.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P40_S1	We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify, on a timely basis, new high-growth markets in the future.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Moreover, we cannot assure you that new markets will develop for our products or our customers' products, or that our technology or pricing will enable such markets to develop.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Future demand for our products is uncertain and will depend to a great degree on continued technological development and the introduction of new or enhanced products.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P40_S4	If this does not continue, sales of our products may decline and our business will be harmed.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We have in the past experienced decreases in the ASPs of some of our products.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P41_S1	As competing products become more widely available, the ASPs of our products may decrease.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P41_S2	If we are unable to offset any decrease in our ASPs by increasing our sales volumes, our net sales will decline.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P41_S3	In addition, to maintain our gross margins, we must continue to reduce the cost of manufacturing our products while maintaining their high quality.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P42_S0	From time to time, our products, like many complex technological products, may fail in greater frequency than anticipated.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P42_S1	This can lead to further charges, which can result in higher costs, lower gross margins and lower operating results.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Furthermore, as ASPs of our current products decline, we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements with higher margins.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P42_S3	If we cannot maintain our gross margins, our operating results could be seriously harmed, particularly if the ASPs of our products decrease significantly.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new and enhanced products that meet the needs of our customers.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our current products address a broad range of commercial and scientific research applications in the photonics markets.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P44_S1	We cannot assure you that the market for these applications will continue to generate significant or consistent demand for our products.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Demand for our products could be significantly diminished by disrupting technologies or products that replace them or render them obsolete.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Furthermore, the new and enhanced products in certain markets generally continue to be smaller in size and have lower ASPs, and therefore, we have to sell more units to maintain revenue levels.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P44_S4	Accordingly, we must continue to invest in research and development in order to develop competitive products.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to anticipate our customers' needs and develop products that address those needs.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Introduction of new products and product enhancements will require that we effectively transfer production processes from research and development to manufacturing and coordinate our efforts with those of our suppliers to achieve volume production rapidly.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P45_S2	If we fail to transfer production processes effectively, develop product enhancements or introduce new products in sufficient quantities to meet the needs of our customers as scheduled, our net sales may be reduced and our business may be harmed.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We face risks associated with our foreign operations and sales that could harm our financial condition and results of operations.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P47_S0	For fiscal 2012 , fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 , 76% , 74% and 67% , respectively, of our net sales were derived from customers outside of the United States.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P47_S1	We anticipate that foreign sales, particularly in Asia, will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P48_S0	A global economic slowdown or a natural disaster could have a negative effect on various foreign markets in which we operate, such as the earthquake, tsunami and resulting nuclear disaster during fiscal 2011 in Japan and last year's flooding in Thailand.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Such a slowdown may cause us to reduce our presence in certain countries, which may negatively affect the overall level of business in such countries.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Our foreign sales are primarily through our direct sales force.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Additionally, some foreign sales are made through foreign distributors and resellers.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Our foreign operations and sales are subject to a number of risks, including:
21510_12_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our business could also be impacted by international conflicts, terrorist and military activity, civil unrest and pandemic illness which could cause a slowdown in customer orders or cause customer order cancellations.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We are also subject to the risks of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, which could materially adversely affect the sales price of our products in foreign markets, as well as the costs and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P52_S0	forward exchange contracts and other risk management techniques to hedge our foreign currency exposure, we remain exposed to the economic risks of foreign currency fluctuations.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We may not be able to protect our proprietary technology which could adversely affect our competitive advantage.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Maintenance of intellectual property rights and the protection thereof is important to our business.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P54_S1	We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P54_S2	We cannot assure you that our patent applications will be approved, that any patents that may be issued will protect our intellectual property or that any issued patents will not be challenged by third parties.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P54_S3	Other parties may independently develop similar or competing technology or design around any patents that may be issued to us.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P54_S4	We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P54_S5	Further, we may be required to enforce our intellectual property or other proprietary rights through litigation, which, regardless of success, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management's attention.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P54_S6	Additionally, there may be existing patents of which we are unaware that could be pertinent to our business and it is not possible for us to know whether there are patent applications pending that our products might infringe upon since these applications are often not publicly available until a patent is issued or published.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We may, in the future, be subject to claims or litigation from third parties, for claims of infringement of their proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of competitors or other rights holders.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P55_S1	These claims could result in costly litigation and the diversion of our technical and management personnel.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Adverse resolution of litigation may harm our operating results or financial condition.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P56_S0	In recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States involving patents and other intellectual property rights.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P56_S1	This has been seen in our industry, for example in the recently concluded patent-related litigation between IMRA America, Inc. and IPG Photonics Corporation.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P57_S0	From time to time, like many other technology companies, we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights, copyrights, trademark rights or other intellectual property rights which such third parties believe may cover certain of our products, processes, technologies or information.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P57_S1	In the future, we may be a party to litigation to protect our intellectual property or as a result of an alleged infringement of others' intellectual property whether through direct claims or by way of indemnification claims of our customers, as, in some cases, we contractually agree to indemnify our customers against third-party infringement claims relating to our products.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P57_S2	These claims and any resulting lawsuit, if successful, could subject us to significant liability for damages or invalidation of our proprietary rights.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P57_S3	These lawsuits, regardless of their success, would likely be time-consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P57_S4	Any potential intellectual property litigation could also force us to do one or more of the following:
21510_12_ITEM1A_P58_S0	redesign the products that use the technology.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P59_S0	If we are forced to take any of these actions or are otherwise a party to lawsuits of this nature, we may incur significant losses for which we do not have insurance and our business may be seriously harmed.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P59_S1	We do not have insurance to cover potential claims of this type.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P60_S0	If our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P61_S2	We recorded a charge during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 related to the impairment of intangibles in our SLS operating segment relating to the decision to discontinue the legacy Hypertronics products.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P61_S3	A decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in market conditions, particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we used to calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units, could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an impairment charge.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P61_S4	Any such material charges, whether related to goodwill or purchased intangible assets, may have a material negative impact on our financial and operating results.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We depend on skilled personnel to operate our business effectively in a rapidly changing market, and if we are unable to retain existing or hire additional personnel when needed, our ability to develop and sell our products could be harmed.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel will be a critical factor in determining whether we will be successful in the future.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Recruiting and retaining highly skilled personnel in certain functions continues to be difficult.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P64_S1	At certain locations where we operate, the cost of living is extremely high and it may be difficult to retain key employees and management at a reasonable cost.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P64_S2	We may not be successful in attracting, assimilating or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P64_S3	Our failure to attract additional employees and retain our existing employees could adversely affect our growth and our business.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and support personnel, any of whom may leave, which could harm our business and our results of operations.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P66_S0	The long sales cycles for our products may cause us to incur significant expenses without offsetting revenues.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Customers often view the purchase of our products as a significant and strategic decision.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P67_S1	As a result, customers typically expend significant effort in evaluating, testing and qualifying our products before making a decision to purchase them, resulting in a lengthy initial sales cycle.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P67_S2	While our customers are evaluating our products and before they place an order with us, we may incur substantial sales and marketing and research and development expenses to customize our products to the customers' needs.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P67_S3	We may also expend significant management efforts, increase manufacturing capacity and order long lead-time components or materials prior to receiving an order.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P67_S4	Even after this evaluation process, a potential customer may not purchase our products.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P67_S5	As a result, these long sales cycles may cause us to incur significant expenses without ever receiving revenue to offset such expenses.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P68_S0	The markets in which we sell our products are intensely competitive and increased competition could cause reduced sales levels, reduced gross margins or the loss of market share.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Competition in the various photonics markets in which we provide products is very intense.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P69_S1	We compete against a number of large public and private companies, including CVI Melles Griot, Cymer, Inc., GSI Group, Inc., IPG Photonics Corporation, JDS Uniphase Corporation, Newport Corporation, Rofin-Sinar Technologies, Inc., and Trumpf GmbH, as well as other smaller companies.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P69_S2	Some of our competitors are large companies that have significant financial, technical, marketing and other resources.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P69_S3	These competitors may be able to devote greater resources than we can to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P69_S4	Some of our competitors are much better positioned than we are to acquire other companies in order to gain new technologies or products that may displace our product lines.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P69_S5	Any of these acquisitions could give our competitors a strategic advantage.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P69_S6	Any business combinations or mergers among our competitors, forming larger companies with greater resources, could result in increased competition, price reductions, reduced margins or loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Additional competitors may enter the markets in which we serve, both foreign and domestic, and we are likely to compete with new companies in the future.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P70_S1	We may encounter potential customers that, due to existing relationships with our competitors, are committed to the products offered by these competitors.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P70_S2	Further, our current or potential customers may determine to develop and produce products for their own use which are competitive to our products.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P70_S3	As a result of the foregoing factors, we expect that competitive pressures may result in price reductions, reduced margins, loss of sales and loss of market share.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P70_S4	In addition, in markets where there are a limited number of customers, competition is particularly intense.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P71_S0	If we fail to accurately forecast component and material requirements for our products, we could incur additional costs and incur significant delays in shipments, which could result in a loss of customers.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P72_S0	We use rolling forecasts based on anticipated product orders and material requirements planning systems to determine our product requirements.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P72_S1	It is very important that we accurately predict both the demand for our products and the lead times required to obtain the necessary components and materials.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P72_S2	We depend on our suppliers for most of our product components and materials.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P72_S3	Lead times for components and materials that we order vary significantly and depend on factors including the specific supplier requirements, the size of the order, contract terms and current market demand for components.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P72_S4	For substantial increases in our sales levels of certain products, some of our suppliers may need at least nine months lead-time.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P72_S5	If we overestimate our component and material requirements, we may have excess inventory, which would increase our costs.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P73_S0	delivery of our products to our customers.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Any of these occurrences would negatively impact our net sales, business or operating results.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Our increased reliance on contract manufacturing and other outsourcing may adversely impact our financial results and operations due to our decreased control over the performance and timing of certain aspects of our manufacturing.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Our manufacturing strategy includes partnering with contract manufacturers to outsource non-core subassemblies and less complex turnkey products, including some performed at international sites located in Asia and Eastern Europe.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P75_S1	Additionally, we have outsourced the manufacture of certain of our optics components to certain third parties.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P75_S2	Our ability to resume internal manufacturing operations for certain products and components in a timely manner may be eliminated.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P75_S3	The cost, quality, performance and availability of contract manufacturing operations are and will be essential to the successful production and sale of many of our products.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P75_S4	Our financial condition or results of operation could be adversely impacted if any contract manufacturer or other supplier is unable for any reason, including as a result of the impact of worldwide economic conditions, to meet our cost, quality, performance, and availability standards.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P75_S5	We may not be able to provide contract manufacturers with product volumes that are high enough to achieve sufficient cost savings.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P75_S6	If shipments fall below forecasted levels, we may incur increased costs or be required to take ownership of the inventory.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P75_S7	Also, our ability to control the quality of products produced by contract manufacturers may be limited and quality issues may not be resolved in a timely manner, which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P76_S0	If we fail to effectively manage our growth or, alternatively, our spending during downturns, our business could be disrupted, which could harm our operating results.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Growth in sales, combined with the challenges of managing geographically dispersed operations, can place a significant strain on our management systems and resources, and our anticipated growth in future operations could continue to place such a strain.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P77_S1	The failure to effectively manage our growth could disrupt our business and harm our operating results.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P77_S2	Our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in evolving markets requires an effective planning and management process.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P77_S3	In economic downturns, we must effectively manage our spending and operations to ensure our competitive position during the downturn, as well as our future opportunities when the economy improves, remain intact.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P77_S4	The failure to effectively manage our spending and operations could disrupt our business and harm our operating results.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Historically, acquisitions have been an important element of our strategy.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P78_S1	However, we may not find suitable acquisition candidates in the future and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P78_S2	Any acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P79_S0	We have in the past made strategic acquisitions of other corporations and entities, as well as asset purchases, and we continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions of complementary companies, products and technologies.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P79_S1	In the event of any future acquisitions, we could:
21510_12_ITEM1A_P80_S0	incur expenses related to impairment of goodwill and amortization.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Acquisitions also involve numerous risks, including:
21510_12_ITEM1A_P82_S0	the failure to complete acquisitions even after signing definitive agreements which, among other things, would result in the expensing of potentially significant professional fees and other charges in the period in which the acquisition or negotiations are terminated.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P83_S0	We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify appropriate acquisition candidates, to integrate any businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future or achieve the anticipated benefits of such transactions, which may harm our business.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P84_S0	We are exposed to lawsuits in the normal course of business which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P85_S0	We are exposed to lawsuits in the normal course of our business, including product liability claims, if personal injury, death or commercial losses occur from the use of our products.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P85_S1	While we typically maintain business insurance, including directors' and officers' policies, litigation can be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations, including the potential impact of indemnification obligations for individuals named in any such lawsuits.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P85_S2	We may not, however, be able to secure insurance coverage on terms acceptable to us in the future.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P85_S3	Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P85_S4	An unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit, including a recall or redesign of products if ultimately determined to be defective, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P86_S0	We use standard laboratory and manufacturing materials that could be considered hazardous and we could be liable for any damage or liability resulting from accidental environmental contamination or injury.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Although most of our products do not incorporate hazardous or toxic materials and chemicals, some of the gases used in our excimer lasers and some of the liquid dyes used in some of our scientific laser products are highly toxic.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P87_S1	In addition, our operations involve the use of standard laboratory and manufacturing materials that could be considered hazardous.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P87_S2	Also, if a facility fire were to occur at our Sunnyvale, California site and were to spread to a reactor used to grow semiconductor wafers, it could release highly toxic emissions.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P87_S3	We believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with all federal, state and offshore regulations and standards.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P87_S4	However, the risk of accidental environmental contamination or injury from such materials cannot be entirely eliminated.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P87_S5	In the event of such an accident involving such materials, we could be liable for damages and such liability could exceed the amount of our liability insurance coverage and the resources of our business which could have an adverse effect on our financial results or our business as a whole.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Compliance or the failure to comply with current and future environmental regulations could cause us significant expense.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P89_S0	We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process or requiring design changes or recycling of products we manufacture.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P89_S1	If we fail to comply with any present and future regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities, the suspension of production or a prohibition on the sale of products we manufacture.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P89_S2	In addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment, or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations, including expenses associated with the recall of any non-compliant product and the management of historical waste.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P90_S0	From time to time new regulations are enacted, and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P90_S1	We continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P91_S0	This and similar legislation that has been or is in the process of being enacted in Japan, China, Korea and various states of the United States may require us to re-design our products to ensure compliance with the applicable standards, for example by requiring the use of different types of materials.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P91_S1	These redesigns or alternative materials may detrimentally impact the performance of our products, add greater testing lead-times for product introductions or have other similar effects.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P91_S2	We believe we comply with all such legislation where our products are sold and we will continue to monitor these laws and the regulations being adopted under them to determine our responsibilities.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P91_S3	In addition, we are monitoring legislation relating to the reduction of carbon emissions from industrial operations to determine whether we may be required to incur any additional material costs or expenses associated with our operations.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P91_S4	We are not currently aware of any such material costs or expenses.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P92_S0	The SEC has recently promulgated rules requiring disclosure regarding the use of certain conflict minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and procedures regarding a manufacturer's efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P92_S1	The implementation of such rules may require significant additional expense, particularly in the event that only a limited pool of suppliers are available to certify that products are free from conflict minerals.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P92_S2	Our failure to comply with any of the foregoing regulatory requirements or contractual obligations could result in our being directly or indirectly liable for costs, fines or penalties and third-party claims, and could jeopardize our ability to conduct business in the United States and foreign countries.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Our and our customers' operations would be seriously harmed if our logistics or facilities or those of our suppliers, our customers' suppliers or our contract manufacturers were to experience catastrophic loss.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Our and our customers' operations, logistics and facilities and those of our suppliers and contract manufacturers could be subject to a catastrophic loss from fire, flood, earthquake, volcanic eruption, work stoppages, power outages, acts of war, pandemic illnesses, energy shortages, theft of assets, other natural disasters or terrorist activity.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P95_S0	A substantial portion of our research and development activities, manufacturing, our corporate headquarters and other critical business operations are located near major earthquake faults in Santa Clara, California, an area with a history of seismic events.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P95_S1	Any such loss or detrimental impact to any of our operations, logistics or facilities could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P95_S2	While we have obtained insurance to cover most potential losses, after reviewing the costs and limitations associated with earthquake insurance, we have decided not to procure such insurance.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P95_S3	We believe that this decision is consistent with decisions reached by numerous other companies located nearby.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P95_S4	We cannot assure you that our existing insurance coverage will be adequate against all other possible losses.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P95_S5	Difficulties with our enterprise resource planning ( ERP ) system and other parts of our global information technology system could harm our business and results of operation.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P95_S6	If our network security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer's data or our data or our information technology systems, we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Like many modern multinational corporations, we maintain a global information technology system, including software products licensed from third parties.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P96_S1	Any system, network or Internet failures, misuse by system users, the hacking into or disruption caused by the unauthorized access by third parties or loss of license rights could disrupt our ability to timely and accurately manufacture and ship products or to report our financial information in compliance with the timelines mandated by the SEC.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P96_S2	Any such failure, misuse, hacking, disruptions or loss would likely cause a diversion of management's attention from the underlying business and could harm our operations.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P96_S3	In addition, a significant failure of our global information technology system could adversely affect our ability to complete an evaluation of our internal controls and attestation activities pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P97_S0	As part of our day-to-day business, we store our data and certain data about our customers in our global information technology system.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P97_S1	While our system is designed with access security, if a third party gains unauthorized access to our data, including any regarding our customers, such security breach could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, loss of business, litigation and possible liability.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P97_S2	These security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P97_S3	Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers' data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P97_S4	Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P97_S5	Any security breach could result in a loss of confidence by our customers, damage our reputation, disrupt our business, lead to legal liability and negatively impact our future sales.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P98_S0	Changes in tax rates, tax liabilities or tax accounting rules could affect future results.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P99_S0	As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries and jurisdictions.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P99_S1	Significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P99_S2	Our future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries or states with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in the tax laws.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P99_S3	In addition, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) and other tax authorities.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P100_S0	From time to time the United States, foreign and state governments make substantive changes to tax rules and the application of rules to companies, including various announcements from the United States government potentially impacting our ability to defer taxes on international earnings.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P100_S1	We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P100_S2	Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Federal securities laws, rules and regulations, as well as the rules and regulations of self-regulatory organizations such as NASDAQ and the NYSE, require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures, impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements, set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers, chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P102_S1	These laws, rules and regulations have increased and will continue to increase the scope, complexity and cost of our corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices, which could harm our results of operations and divert management's attention from business operations.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P103_S0	Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P103_S1	New or changed laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P103_S2	As a result, their application in practice may evolve over time.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P104_S0	We are committed to maintaining high standards of ethics, corporate governance and public disclosure.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P104_S1	Complying with evolving interpretations of new or changed legal requirements may cause us to incur higher costs as we revise current practices, policies and procedures, and may divert management time and attention from revenue generating to compliance activities.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P104_S2	If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, our reputation may also be harmed.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Governmental regulations, including duties, affecting the import or export of products could negatively affect our revenues.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P106_S0	The United States and many foreign governments impose tariffs and duties on the import and export of products, including some of those which we sell.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P106_S1	In particular, given our worldwide operations, we pay duties on certain products when they are imported into the United States for repair work as well as on certain of our products which are manufactured by our foreign subsidiaries.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P106_S2	These products can be subject to a duty on the product value.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P106_S3	Additionally, the United States and various foreign governments have imposed tariffs, controls, export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies, especially encryption technology.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P106_S4	From time to time, government agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology, such as requiring the escrow and governmental recovery of private encryption keys.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P106_S5	Governmental regulation of encryption technology and regulation of imports or exports, or our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products, could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P106_S6	From time to time our duty calculations and payments are audited by government agencies.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P107_S0	In addition, compliance with the directives of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls ( DDTC ) may result in substantial expenses and diversion of management.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P107_S1	Any failure to adequately address the directives of DDTC could result in civil fines or suspension or loss of our export privileges, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P108_S0	Our market is unpredictable and characterized by rapid technological changes and evolving standards demanding a significant investment in research and development, and, if we fail to address changing market conditions, our business and operating results will be harmed.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P109_S0	The photonics industry is characterized by extensive research and development, rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P109_S1	Because this industry is subject to rapid change, it is difficult to predict its potential size or future growth rate.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P109_S2	Our success in generating revenues in this industry will depend on, among other things:
21510_12_ITEM1A_P110_S0	our ability to accurately predict and develop our products to meet industry standards.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P111_S0	For our fiscal years 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , our research and development costs were $78.3 million ( 10.2% of net sales), $81.2 million ( 10.1% of net sales) and $72.4 million ( 12.0% of net sales), respectively.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P111_S1	We cannot assure you that our expenditures for research and development will result in the introduction of new products or, if such products are introduced, that those products will achieve sufficient market acceptance or to generate sales to offset the costs of development.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P111_S2	Our failure to address rapid technological changes in our markets could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P112_S0	Failure to maintain effective internal controls may cause a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements or to cause us to delay filing our periodic reports with the SEC and adversely affect our stock price.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P113_S0	The SEC, as directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on Form 10-K that contain an assessment by management of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P113_S1	In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P113_S2	Although we test our internal control over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with the Section 404 requirements, our failure to maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements or a delay in our ability to timely file our periodic reports with the SEC, which ultimately could negatively impact our stock price.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P114_S0	Provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law, and our Change-of-Control Severance Plan may have anti-takeover effects that could prevent or delay a change in control.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P115_S0	Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition or make removal of incumbent directors or officers more difficult.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P115_S1	These provisions may discourage takeover attempts and bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P116_S0	establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P117_S0	We are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a merger, asset or stock sale or other transaction with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date such person became an interested stockholder, unless prior approval of our board of directors is obtained or as otherwise provided.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P117_S1	These provisions of Delaware law also may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us without obtaining the prior approval of our board of directors, which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P118_S0	In addition, we have adopted a change of control severance plan, which provides for the payment of a cash severance benefit to each eligible employee based on the employee's position.
21510_12_ITEM1A_P118_S1	If a change of control occurs, our successor or acquirer will be required to assume and agree to perform all of our obligations under the change of control severance plan which may discourage potential acquirors or result in a lower stock price.

21510_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	Derivative Lawsuits Between February 15, 2007 and March 2, 2007, three purported shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against certain of the Company's current and former officers and directors.
21510_12_ITEM3_P0_S1	The Company was named as a nominal defendant.
21510_12_ITEM3_P0_S2	The complaints generally allege that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties and violated the securities laws in connection with the granting of stock options, the accounting treatment for such grants, the issuance of allegedly misleading public statements and stock sales by certain of the individual defendants.
21510_12_ITEM3_P0_S3	On November 24, 2009 , the United States District Court of the Northern District of California entered an Order and Final Judgment, which approved a negotiated settlement and dismissed the action with prejudice.
21510_12_ITEM3_P1_S0	proceeds (which included reimbursement for certain legal costs incurred in prior years) and the payment of the plaintiff attorneys' fees and expenses, we received a net cash benefit of $2.2 million from the settlement on December 11, 2009 , which was recorded in selling general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2010.
21510_12_ITEM3_P2_S0	Income Tax Audits We are subject to taxation and file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions.
21510_12_ITEM3_P2_S1	For U.S. federal income tax purposes, all years prior to 2009 are closed.
21510_12_ITEM3_P2_S2	In our major foreign jurisdictions and our major state jurisdictions, the years prior to 2006 and 2008, respectively, are closed to examination.
21510_12_ITEM3_P2_S3	Earlier years in our various jurisdictions may remain open for adjustment to the extent that we have tax attribute carryforwards from those years.
21510_12_ITEM3_P3_S0	In December 2011 and January 2012, our three German subsidiaries received notices of tax audits for the fiscal years 2006 through 2010.
21510_12_ITEM3_P3_S1	These audits are currently in process.
21510_12_ITEM3_P3_S2	Management believes that it has adequately provided for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.
21510_12_ITEM3_P4_S0	The Company regularly engages in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions.
21510_12_ITEM3_P4_S1	It is reasonably possible that certain federal, foreign and state tax matters may be concluded in the next 12 months.
21510_12_ITEM3_P4_S2	Although the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that the balance of net unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties could be reduced by approximately $0.5 million to $3.0 million in the next 12 months.
21510_12_ITEM5_P0_S0	The number of stockholders of record as of November 23, 2012 was 935 .
21510_12_ITEM5_P0_S1	No cash dividends have been declared or paid since Coherent was founded and we have no present intention to declare or pay cash dividends.

21510_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS Below is a summary of some of the quantitative performance indicators (as defined below) that are evaluated by management to assess our financial performance.
21510_12_ITEM7_P0_S1	Some of the indicators are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered as an alternative to any other measure for determining operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
21510_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	Definitions and analysis of these performance indicators are as follows: Bookings and Book-to-Bill Ratio Bookings represent orders expected to be shipped within 12 months and services to be provided pursuant to service contracts.
21510_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	While we generally have not experienced a significant rate of cancellation, bookings are generally cancelable by our customers without substantial penalty and, therefore, we cannot assure all bookings will be converted to net sales.
21510_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	The book-to-bill ratio is calculated as annual bookings divided by annual net sales.
21510_12_ITEM7_P2_S1	This is an indication of the strength of our business but can sometimes be impacted by a single large order.
21510_12_ITEM7_P2_S2	A ratio greater than 1.0 indicates that demand for our products is greater than what we supply in the year.
21510_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	Fiscal 2012 bookings decreased from record bookings in fiscal 2011.
21510_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	Although we maintained a positive book-to-bill of 1.01, the book-to-bill ratio declined to 0.90 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.
21510_12_ITEM7_P3_S2	Bookings decreased 13.6% from fiscal 2011 , with decreases in all markets.
21510_12_ITEM7_P3_S3	Bookings decreases by market compared to fiscal 2011 were microelectronics ( 16% ), OEM components and instrumentation ( 14% ), scientific ( 13% ) and materials processing ( 2% ).
21510_12_ITEM7_P3_S4	Although fiscal 2012 bookings decreased in all markets, decreases in bookings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 in the microelectronics market due to timing of large orders were partially offset by increases in the OEM components and instrumentation, scientific and materials processing markets.
21510_12_ITEM7_P3_S5	Fiscal 2011 bookings reached a new record for us.
21510_12_ITEM7_P3_S6	Bookings increased 28.6% from fiscal 2010, with a significant increase in the microelectronics market.
21510_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	materials processing (22%) and scientific (3%), partially offset by a decrease in the OEM components and instrumentation market (3%).
21510_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	Although fiscal 2011 bookings were a record, bookings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 decreased from the third quarter of fiscal 2011, with a fourth quarter book-to-bill of 0.94, primarily due to timing of large orders in the microelectronics market.
21510_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	Microelectronics Fiscal 2012 bookings decreased 16% from record-setting bookings in fiscal 2011 and the book-to-bill ratio for the year was 1.05 .
21510_12_ITEM7_P4_S3	Flat panel display orders for fiscal 2012 decreased 10% from record orders in fiscal 2011, but orders continued to be strong.
21510_12_ITEM7_P4_S4	In response to the increased demand, we invested in manufacturing capacity in G ttingen and South Korea during fiscal 2012.
21510_12_ITEM7_P4_S5	In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we received record laser annealing system orders to be used for liquid crystal display ("LCD") and active-matrix organic light emitting diode ("AMOLED") production from integrators for flat panel display manufacturers in Japan, Korea and China as well as strong service orders.
21510_12_ITEM7_P4_S6	We expect follow-on system orders as well as increasing service orders in fiscal 2013 and continued fluctuations in order volumes on a quarterly basis as evidenced by lower orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.
21510_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	During the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we shipped our first Gen 8 system, a device that sets a new throughput standard for laser annealing tools.
21510_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	Advanced packaging ("API") orders decreased significantly for the full fiscal year as the overall market was very soft.
21510_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	In addition, the market was impacted by tight credit in China where it has been difficult for customers to establish letters of credit for new equipment purchases.
21510_12_ITEM7_P6_S2	Although the API market remains slow, we are seeing increasing signals for a recovery later in calendar 2013.
21510_12_ITEM7_P6_S3	Part of the market growth in mobile packaging has been satisfied by utilizing the capacity freed up by slow orders in personal computer applications, but we believe integrators will need to place replenishment orders later in calendar 2013.
21510_12_ITEM7_P6_S4	Orders from semiconductor capital equipment OEMs increased 11% in fiscal 2012 reflecting increased orders for inspection applications and strong service orders.
21510_12_ITEM7_P6_S5	Orders for sales and service of semiconductor lasers trended down towards the end of fiscal 2012, which is consistent with indications that the semiconductor business is slowing down.
21510_12_ITEM7_P6_S6	Data from industry reports suggests that calendar 2013 semiconductor business will decrease from calendar 2012 and will increase in calendar 2014, which should favorably impact orders later in calendar 2013.
21510_12_ITEM7_P6_S7	On the product development front, we continue to advance the state of the art in support of 450mm and EUV inspection and metrology applications.
21510_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	OEM Components and Instrumentation Bookings in fiscal 2012 decreased 14% from fiscal 2011 and the book-to-bill ratio for the year was 0.96 .
21510_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	Although bookings declined for the full fiscal year primarily due to decreased government spending on life sciences and closer inventory management by customers resulting in smaller batch orders rather than semi-annual or annual orders in the first three quarters of fiscal 2012, orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 were strong due to the timing of certain large orders and strength in the instrumentation market.
21510_12_ITEM7_P7_S2	Instrumentation orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 increased significantly from the third quarter of fiscal 2012 due to the timing of large orders from key accounts in the flow cytometry market, including higher bookings for our OBIS portfolio.
21510_12_ITEM7_P7_S3	We expect OBIS adoption to further strengthen throughout fiscal 2013 and will also expand our offering of OBIS-based subsystems that will provide customers with a broad range of customizable solutions.
21510_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	Orders from the medical OEM market benefitted during fiscal 2012 from strong consumer demand for vision and aesthetic procedures in emerging markets.
21510_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	Customers in the refractive markets are projecting good growth rates for calendar 2013, which led to semiannual or annual orders for low-power excimer lasers during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.
21510_12_ITEM7_P8_S2	The home-based aesthetic market continues to expand as more individuals are turning towards laser-based hair reduction and skin treatment, resulting in solid bookings for our semiconductor lasers in fiscal 2012.

21510_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	Days Sales Outstanding in Receivables We calculate days sales outstanding ("DSO") in receivables as net receivables at the end of the period divided by net sales during the period and then multiplied by the number of days in the period, using 360 days for years.
21510_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	indicates how well we are managing our collection of receivables, with lower DSO in receivables resulting in higher working capital availability.
21510_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	The more money we have tied up in receivables, the less money we have available for research and development, acquisitions, expansion, marketing and other activities to grow our business.
21510_12_ITEM7_P20_S2	Our DSO in receivables for fiscal 2012 increased 4.4 days from fiscal 2011 to 67.6 days.
21510_12_ITEM7_P20_S3	The increase in DSO in receivables is primarily due to the higher mix of revenue and related receivables in Asia where customary payment terms result in higher DSOs than the average DSO for the Company taken as a whole as well as a higher concentration of sales in the last month of the fiscal year.
21510_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	Annualized Fourth Quarter Inventory Turns We calculate annualized fourth quarter inventory turns as cost of sales during the fourth quarter annualized and divided by net inventories at the end of the fourth quarter.
21510_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	This indicates how well we are managing our inventory levels, with higher inventory turns resulting in more working capital availability and a higher return on our investments in inventory.
21510_12_ITEM7_P21_S2	The more money we have tied up in inventory, the less money we have available for research and development, acquisitions, expansion, marketing and other activities to grow our business.
21510_12_ITEM7_P21_S3	Our annualized inventory turns for fiscal 2012 decreased 0.3 turns from fiscal 2011 to 2.8 turns.
21510_12_ITEM7_P21_S4	The deterioration in inventory turns is primarily due to the impact of decreased sales volumes in relation to inventory levels in certain businesses as well as increased inventory to support a sizable backlog of flat panel laser annealing systems.
21510_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	Capital Spending as a Percentage of Net Sales Capital spending as a percentage of net sales ("capital spending percentage") is calculated as capital expenditures for the period divided by net sales for the period.
21510_12_ITEM7_P22_S1	Capital spending percentage indicates the extent to which we are expanding or improving our operations, including investments in technology and equipment.
21510_12_ITEM7_P22_S2	Management monitors capital spending levels as this assists management in measuring our cash flows, net of capital expenditures.
21510_12_ITEM7_P22_S3	Our capital spending percentage increased to 4.7% in fiscal 2012 from 4.6% in fiscal 2011 and 2.5% in fiscal 2010 .
21510_12_ITEM7_P22_S4	The fiscal 2012 increase was primarily due to building improvements and purchases of production-related assets to support our expansion in Asia (South Korea and Singapore) and Germany.
21510_12_ITEM7_P22_S5	The fiscal 2011 increase was primarily due to purchases of production-related assets and building improvements to support higher sales volumes.
21510_12_ITEM7_P22_S6	We expect capital spending for fiscal 2013 to be approximately 3.5% of net sales.
21510_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	We define adjusted EBITDA as operating income adjusted for depreciation, amortization, stock compensation expenses, major restructuring costs and certain other non-operating income and expense items.
21510_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	Key initiatives to reach our goals for EBITDA improvements include utilization of our Asian manufacturing locations, rationalizing our supply chain and continued leveraging of our infrastructure.

21510_12_ITEM7_P43_S14	On a segment basis, CLC spending decreased $4.2 million primarily due to lower payroll spending and lower other variable spending.
21510_12_ITEM7_P43_S15	SLS segment expenses decreased $4.4 million primarily due to lower payroll spending and lower other variable spending.
21510_12_ITEM7_P43_S16	Spending for Corporate and other decreased $2.4 million primarily due to lower payroll spending and lower other variable spending partially offset by higher stock-related compensation expense.
21510_12_ITEM7_P43_S17	Fiscal 2011 SG A expenses increased $25.9 million, or 21%, from fiscal 2010.
21510_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	2010 ($2.2 million), partially offset by lower restructuring costs ($2.2 million).
21510_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	In addition, fiscal 2010 SG A expenses were reduced by a $2.2 million net receipt from the settlement of litigation resulting from our stock option investigation.
21510_12_ITEM7_P44_S2	On a segment basis, CLC spending increased $3.5 million primarily due to higher payroll spending and higher other variable spending partially offset by lower restructuring costs.
21510_12_ITEM7_P44_S3	SLS segment expenses increased $12.6 million primarily due to higher payroll spending, the acquisition of Hypertronics and higher other variable spending.
21510_12_ITEM7_P44_S4	Spending for Corporate and other increased $9.8 million primarily due to higher stock-related compensation expense, the net receipt from the settlement of litigation resulting from our stock option investigation in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, higher payroll spending, higher charges for increases in deferred compensation plan liabilities and higher other variable spending.
21510_12_ITEM7_P44_S5	Amortization of intangible assets Amortization of intangible assets increased $2.3 million , or 28% , from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012 primarily due to the fourth quarter fiscal 2012 impairment of $4.0 million of Hypertronics intangibles partially offset by completion of amortization of certain intangibles related to prior acquisitions.
21510_12_ITEM7_P44_S6	Amortization of intangible assets increased $0.1 million, or 1%, from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 primarily due to the amortization of intangibles from the acquisition of Hypertronics in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 and Beam Dynamics in the third quarter of fiscal 2010, partially offset by completion of amortization of certain intangibles related to prior acquisitions.
21510_12_ITEM7_P44_S7	Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net, decreased $10.0 million from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012 .
21510_12_ITEM7_P44_S8	The decrease was primarily due to the $6.5 million non-recurring translation adjustment related to the dissolution of our Finland operations in the second quarter of fiscal 2011, lower net foreign currency exchange gains ($1.9 million) and lower gains on our deferred compensation plan assets net of expenses ($1.5 million) including death benefits of $0.2 million in fiscal 2012 and $1.5 million in fiscal 2011.
21510_12_ITEM7_P44_S9	Other income (expense), net, increased $10.7 million from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011.
21510_12_ITEM7_P44_S10	The increase was primarily due to the $6.5 million non-recurring translation adjustment related to the dissolution of our Finland operations, higher net foreign currency exchange gains ($2.9 million) and higher gains on our deferred compensation plan assets net of expenses ($2.4 million) including a $1.5 million death benefit, partially offset by lower interest income ($1.0 million) primarily due to interest on a tax refund in fiscal 2010.
21510_12_ITEM7_P44_S11	Income taxes The effective tax rate on income before income taxes for fiscal 2012 of 30.5% was lower than the statutory rate of 35.0%.
21510_12_ITEM7_P44_S12	No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes ) and related interest.
21510_12_ITEM7_P44_S13	During fiscal 2012, we increased our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by $0.3 million to $9.1 million primarily due to the reduced ability to utilize California research and development tax credits and offset by the net increased ability to utilize foreign tax attributes and net operating losses of our subsidiaries in the fourth quarter.
21510_12_ITEM7_P44_S14	During fiscal 2011, we increased our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by $1.5 million to $8.8 million, primarily due to the reduced ability to utilize foreign tax attributes and net operating losses and the reduced ability to utilize California research and development tax credits as a result of releasing net unrecognized tax benefits under ASC 740-10 that supported the credits.
21510_12_ITEM7_P44_S15	During fiscal 2010, we increased our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets to $7.4 million, primarily due to a capital loss limitation true-up, the reduced ability to utilize California research and development tax credits as a result of the current apportionment factor and the reduced ability to utilize foreign net operating losses.
21510_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	In making the determination to record the valuation allowance, management considered the likelihood of future taxable income and feasible and prudent tax planning strategies to realize deferred tax assets.
21510_12_ITEM7_P45_S1	In the future, if we determine that we expect to realize deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the valuation allowance will affect income in the period such determination is made.
21510_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	The effective tax rate on income before income taxes for fiscal 2011 of 24.7% was lower than the statutory rate of 35.0%.
21510_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	This was primarily due to the benefit of releasing unrecognized tax benefits under ASC 740-10 and related interest, the benefit of federal research and development credits, including additional credits reinstated from fiscal 2010 resulting from the enactment of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Jobs Creation Acts of 2010, the benefit of foreign tax credits, the benefit of currency translation adjustments related to closure of Coherent Finland's operations, the benefit from income subject to foreign tax rates that are lower than U.S. tax rates and the benefit from the unrealized gain on life insurance policy investments related to our deferred compensation plans.
21510_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	compensation under IRC Section 162(m), deemed dividend inclusions under the Subpart F tax rules and a currency translation adjustment related to a dividend from a foreign subsidiary.
21510_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	The effective tax rate on income before income taxes for fiscal 2010 of 36.3% was higher than the statutory rate of 35.0%.
21510_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	This was primarily due to stock compensation not deductible for tax purposes and an increase in valuation allowance against capital loss carryforwards, California research and development tax credits as a result of California legislation enacted in February 2009 and certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards.
21510_12_ITEM7_P48_S2	These increases are partially offset by the benefit of income subject to foreign tax rates that are lower than U.S. tax rates and research and development credits.
21510_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	We operate under tax holiday in Singapore which is effective from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2017 and may be extended if certain additional requirements are satisfied.
21510_12_ITEM7_P49_S1	The tax holiday is conditional upon our meeting certain revenue, business spending and employment thresholds.
21510_12_ITEM7_P49_S2	As a result of a current loss, we did not realize a benefit for the Singapore tax holiday in fiscal year 2012.
21510_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity and capital resources At September 29, 2012 , we had assets classified as cash and cash equivalents, as well as time deposits and fixed income securities classified as short-term investments, in an aggregate amount of $224.9 million , compared to $220.2 million at October 1, 2011 .
21510_12_ITEM7_P50_S1	At September 29, 2012 , approximately $139.4 million of the cash and securities was held in certain of our foreign operations, $46.1 million of which was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
21510_12_ITEM7_P50_S2	In January 2012, we converted $89.8 million of assets formerly denominated in Euro to U.S. dollars and invested those funds in U.S. Treasury securities within a European subsidiary whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar.
21510_12_ITEM7_P50_S3	Accordingly, there is no translation adjustment arising from these U.S. dollar denominated investments.
21510_12_ITEM7_P50_S4	The converted funds were not repatriated to the U.S. and no U.S. tax was triggered on the transfer of these funds to the European subsidiary.
21510_12_ITEM7_P50_S5	We incurred additional foreign income taxes of approximately $0.8 million related to this distribution.
21510_12_ITEM7_P50_S6	We currently have approximately $131 million of cash, including the investment in U.S. Treasury securities, held by foreign subsidiaries.
21510_12_ITEM7_P50_S7	We intend to permanently reinvest our accumulated earnings in these entities and our current plans do not demonstrate a need for these funds to support our domestic operations.
21510_12_ITEM7_P50_S8	If, however, a portion of these funds were needed for and distributed to our operations in the United States, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes.
21510_12_ITEM7_P50_S9	The amount of the taxes due would depend on the amount and manner of repatriation, as well as the location from where the funds are repatriated.
21510_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	We actively monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold these assets, primarily focusing on the safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield on these assets.
21510_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	We diversify our cash and cash equivalents and investments among various financial institutions, money market funds and sovereign debt in order to reduce our exposure should any one of these financial institutions or financial instruments fail or encounter difficulties.
21510_12_ITEM7_P51_S2	To date, we have not experienced any material loss or lack of access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments.
21510_12_ITEM7_P51_S3	However, we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets.
21510_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	Sources and Uses of Cash Historically, our primary source of cash has been provided by operations.
21510_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	Other sources of cash in the past three fiscal years include proceeds received from the sale of our stock through our employee stock option and purchase plans.
21510_12_ITEM7_P52_S2	Our historical uses of cash have primarily been for the repurchase of our common stock, capital expenditures and acquisitions of businesses and technologies.
21510_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $21.9 million in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 and increased by $7.9 million in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 .
21510_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	compensation and accounts payable partially offset by higher cash flows from inventories and accounts receivable.
21510_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	The increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to higher net income partially offset by lower cash flows from inventories, accounts payable and other current liabilities.
21510_12_ITEM7_P54_S2	We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short term investments combined with cash to be provided by operating activities will be adequate to cover our working capital needs and planned capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months to the extent such items are known or are reasonably determinable based on current business and market conditions.
21510_12_ITEM7_P54_S3	However, we may elect to finance certain of our capital expenditure requirements through borrowings under our bank credit facilities or other sources of capital.
21510_12_ITEM7_P54_S4	We continue to follow our strategy to further strengthen our financial position by using available cash flow to fund operations.
21510_12_ITEM7_P54_S5	We intend to continue pursuing acquisition opportunities at valuations we believe are reasonable based upon market conditions.
21510_12_ITEM7_P54_S6	However, we cannot accurately predict the timing, size and success of our acquisition efforts or our associated potential capital commitments.
21510_12_ITEM7_P54_S7	Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire businesses on terms acceptable to us.
21510_12_ITEM7_P54_S8	We expect to fund future acquisitions primarily through existing cash balances and cash flows from operations.
21510_12_ITEM7_P54_S9	If required, we will look for additional borrowings or consider the issuance of securities.
21510_12_ITEM7_P54_S10	The extent to which we will be willing or able to use our common stock to make acquisitions will depend on its market value at the time and the willingness of potential sellers to accept it as full or partial payment.
21510_12_ITEM7_P54_S11	On April 29, 2010 , we announced that the Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $50.0 million of our common stock.
21510_12_ITEM7_P54_S12	During fiscal 2010, we repurchased and retired 1,195,829 shares of outstanding common stock at an average price of $36.21 per share for a total of $43.3 million , excluding expenses.
21510_12_ITEM7_P54_S13	On January 26, 2011 , the Board canceled this program and authorized the repurchase of up to $75.0 million of our common stock.
21510_12_ITEM7_P54_S14	The program was authorized for 12 months from the date of authorization.
21510_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	In March 2011, we repurchased and retired 454,682 shares of outstanding common stock under a modified "Dutch Auction" tender offer at an average price of $59.00 per share for a total of $26.8 million , excluding expenses.
21510_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2011, we repurchased and retired an additional 1,024,409 shares of outstanding common stock at an average price of $47.03 per share for a total of $48.2 million , excluding expenses.
21510_12_ITEM7_P55_S2	On August 25, 2011, we announced that the Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $50.0 million of our common stock.
21510_12_ITEM7_P55_S3	The program was authorized for 12 months from the date of authorization.
21510_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	During fiscal 2011 , we repurchased and retired 586,200 shares of outstanding common stock at an average price of $42.67 per share for a total of $25.0 million , excluding expenses.
21510_12_ITEM7_P56_S1	During fiscal 2012 , we repurchased and retired 543,200 shares of outstanding common stock at an average price of $45.99 per share for a total of $25.0 million , excluding expenses, completing the repurchase.
21510_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	On October 4, 2012 , the Board of Directors authorized a buyback program whereby we are authorized to repurchase up to $25 million of our common stock.
21510_12_ITEM7_P57_S1	This buyback program is discussed in Note 19 "Subsequent Events" in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of this annual report.
21510_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	During fiscal year 2008, we initiated restructuring plans to decrease costs by consolidating facilities and reducing our workforce.
21510_12_ITEM7_P58_S1	As of September 29, 2012 , we had made payments in connection with the restructuring plans in the amount of $27.7 million .
21510_12_ITEM7_P58_S2	We completed payments for substantially all anticipated costs related to the restructuring plans in the third quarter of fiscal 2011.
21510_12_ITEM7_P58_S3	Additional sources of cash available to us were domestic and international currency lines of credit and bank credit facilities totaling $70.2 million as of September 29, 2012 , of which $68.2 million was unused and available.
21510_12_ITEM7_P58_S4	These unsecured credit facilities were used in Europe and Japan during fiscal 2012 .
21510_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	Our domestic line of credit consists of a $50.0 million unsecured revolving credit account with Union Bank of California, which expires on May 31, 2014 and is subject to covenants related to financial ratios and tangible net worth.
21510_12_ITEM7_P59_S1	No amounts have been drawn upon our domestic line of credit and $1.9 million of the international currency lines has been used as guarantees as of September 29, 2012 .
21510_12_ITEM7_P59_S2	Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 4.0 :1 at September 29, 2012 , compared to 3.6 :1 at October 1, 2011 .
21510_12_ITEM7_P59_S3	The increase in our ratio is primarily due increases in cash and short-term investments and inventories as well as decreases in accounts payable and other current liabilities.
21510_12_ITEM7_P59_S4	Our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, working capital and debt obligations are as follows (in thousands):
21510_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933.
21510_12_ITEM7_P60_S1	The following summarizes our contractual obligations at September 29, 2012 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):
21510_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	Because of the uncertainty as to the timing of such payments, we have excluded cash payments related to our contractual obligations for our deferred compensation plans aggregating $25.7 million at September 29, 2012 .
21510_12_ITEM7_P61_S1	As of September 29, 2012 , we recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $27.6 million including gross interest and penalties of $1.6 million .
21510_12_ITEM7_P61_S2	As of October 1, 2011 , we recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $33.7 million including gross interest and penalties of $3.4 million .
21510_12_ITEM7_P61_S3	Both gross unrecognized tax benefits and gross interest and penalties are classified as non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
21510_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.
21510_12_ITEM7_P62_S1	As a result, these amounts are not included in the table above.
21510_12_ITEM7_P62_S2	Changes in financial condition Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2012 was $64.8 million , which included net income of $63.0 million , depreciation and amortization of $29.6 million , stock-based compensation expense of $16.3 million and the $4.1 million write-off of Hypertronics intangibles partially offset by cash used by operating assets and liabilities of $42.0 million , increases in net deferred tax assets of $4.8 million and $1.4 million other.
21510_12_ITEM7_P62_S3	Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2012 of $142.9 million included $103.5 million net purchases of available-for-sale securities, $35.7 million , net, used to acquire property and equipment and improve buildings and $3.7 million used to acquire Midaz.
21510_12_ITEM7_P62_S4	Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2012 was $15.0 million , including $25.0 million used to repurchase our common stock and $3.3 million other partially offset by $13.3 million generated from our employee stock purchase plans.
21510_12_ITEM7_P62_S5	Changes in exchange rates in fiscal 2012 resulted in a decrease in cash balances of $6.1 million .
21510_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 2.
21510_12_ITEM7_P63_S1	"Significant Accounting Policies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of this annual report for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the respective dates of adoption or expected adoption and effects on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
21510_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.
21510_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
21510_12_ITEM7_P65_S1	We have identified the following as the items that require the most significant judgment and often involve complex estimation: revenue recognition, accounting for long-lived assets (including goodwill and intangible assets), inventory valuation, warranty reserves, stock-based compensation and accounting for income taxes.
21510_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered or the service has been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable.
21510_12_ITEM7_P66_S1	Revenue from product sales is recorded when all of the foregoing conditions are met and risk of loss and title passes to the customer.
21510_12_ITEM7_P66_S2	Our products typically include a warranty and the estimated cost of product warranty claims (based on historical experience) is recorded at the time the sale is recognized.
21510_12_ITEM7_P66_S3	Sales to customers are generally not subject to any price protection or return rights.
21510_12_ITEM7_P66_S4	The vast majority of our sales are made to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), distributors, resellers and end-users in the non-scientific market.
21510_12_ITEM7_P66_S5	Sales made to these customers do not require installation of the products by us and are not subject to other post-delivery obligations, except in occasional instances where we have agreed to perform installation or provide training.
21510_12_ITEM7_P66_S6	In those instances, we defer revenue related to installation services or training until these services have been rendered.
21510_12_ITEM7_P66_S7	We allocate revenue from multiple element arrangements to the various elements based upon fair values or a selling price hierarchy, for arrangements entered into subsequent to October 2, 2010, as more fully described in Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition," in our consolidated financial statements.
21510_12_ITEM7_P66_S8	Should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions, revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected.
21510_12_ITEM7_P66_S9	Failure to obtain anticipated orders due to delays or cancellations of orders could have a material adverse effect on our revenue.
21510_12_ITEM7_P66_S10	In addition, pressures from customers to reduce our prices or to modify our existing sales terms may have a material adverse effect on our revenue in future periods.
21510_12_ITEM7_P66_S11	Our sales to distributors, resellers and end-user customers typically do not have customer acceptance provisions and only certain of our sales to OEM customers and integrators have customer acceptance provisions.
21510_12_ITEM7_P66_S12	Customer acceptance is generally limited to performance under our published product specifications.
21510_12_ITEM7_P66_S13	For the few product sales that have customer acceptance provisions because of higher than published specifications, (1) the products are tested and accepted by the customer at our site or by the customer's acceptance of the results of our testing program prior to shipment to the customer, or (2) the revenue is deferred until customer acceptance occurs.
21510_12_ITEM7_P67_S0	Sales to end-users in the scientific market typically require installation and, thus, involve post-delivery obligations; however our post-delivery installation obligations are not essential to the functionality of our products.
21510_12_ITEM7_P67_S1	We defer revenue related to installation services until completion of these services.
21510_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	For most products, training is not provided; therefore, no post-delivery training obligation exists.
21510_12_ITEM7_P68_S1	However, when training is provided to our customers, it is typically priced separately and recognized as revenue as these services are provided.
21510_12_ITEM7_P68_S2	For multiple element arrangements which include extended maintenance contracts, we allocate and defer the amount of consideration equal to the separately stated price and recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
21510_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill We evaluate long-lived assets and amortizable intangible assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances or our planned use of assets indicate that their carrying amounts may not be fully recoverable or that their useful lives are no longer appropriate.
21510_12_ITEM7_P69_S1	Reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying values of the assets are impaired based on comparison to the undiscounted expected future cash flows identifiable to such long-lived and amortizable intangible assets.
21510_12_ITEM7_P69_S2	If the comparison indicates that impairment exists, the impaired asset is written down to its fair value.
21510_12_ITEM7_P70_S0	We have determined that our reporting units are the same as our operating segments as each constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results.
21510_12_ITEM7_P70_S1	We make this determination in a manner consistent with how the operating segments are managed.
21510_12_ITEM7_P70_S2	Based on this analysis, we have identified two reporting units which are our reportable segments: CLC and SLS.
21510_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and written down when impaired (see Note 8 "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).
21510_12_ITEM7_P71_S1	We generally perform our annual impairment tests during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter, with any resulting impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.
21510_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.
21510_12_ITEM7_P72_S1	If an entity determines as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not ( 50% likelihood) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative test is required.
21510_12_ITEM7_P72_S2	Otherwise, no further testing is required.
21510_12_ITEM7_P72_S3	We adopted this accounting guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 .
21510_12_ITEM7_P72_S4	For fiscal 2010, we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter and noted no impairment.
21510_12_ITEM7_P72_S5	Such analysis requires significant judgments and estimates to be made by management in particular related to the forecast.
21510_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	The assumed growth rates and gross margins as well as period expenses were determined based on internally developed forecasts considering our future plans.
21510_12_ITEM7_P73_S1	The assumptions used were management's best estimates based on projected results and market conditions as of the date of testing.
21510_12_ITEM7_P73_S2	Utilizing the Income Approach, we noted no impairment.
21510_12_ITEM7_P73_S3	Based on our evaluation, the fair values of each of the two operating segments significantly exceeded their carrying value.
21510_12_ITEM7_P73_S4	In order to test the sensitivity of these fair values, management further reviewed other scenarios relative to these assumptions to see if the resulting impact on fair values would have resulted in a different conclusion for the CLC and SLS reporting units.
21510_12_ITEM7_P73_S5	Sensitivity was applied to the discount rate used in the Income approach for both the CLC and SLS reporting units.
21510_12_ITEM7_P73_S6	The discount rate for the CLC and SLS reporting units could have been increased by more than 25% and still resulted in no impairment.
21510_12_ITEM7_P73_S7	Based on the outcome of this testing and sensitivity analysis, we decided it would not be necessary to utilize all three testing methods for this annual test.
21510_12_ITEM7_P74_S0	Under the goodwill standards in effect for fiscal 2011, a company could carry forward the detailed determination of a reporting unit from one year to the next if certain criteria have been met.
21510_12_ITEM7_P74_S1	Those criteria include: the assets and liabilities that make up the reporting unit have not changed significantly since the most recent fair value determination, the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting unit by a substantial margin, and based on an analysis of events that have occurred and circumstances that have changed since the most recent fair value determination, the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is remote.
21510_12_ITEM7_P74_S2	Based on our analysis and a review of the criteria, using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we determined that we had met the requirements of the goodwill standard for carrying forward our fair value determination from fiscal 2010, and did not perform detailed testing of the fair value of our reporting units for fiscal 2011.
21510_12_ITEM7_P74_S3	Between the completion of that testing and the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we noted no indications of impairment or triggering events to cause us to review goodwill for potential impairment; based on our evaluation, the fair values of each of the two operating segments significantly exceeded their carrying value as of that date.
21510_12_ITEM7_P75_S0	In our fiscal 2012 annual testing, we performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying amount.
21510_12_ITEM7_P75_S1	In assessing the qualitative factors, we considered the impact of these key factors: macroeconomic conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency, market and industry conditions, our operating and competitive environment, regulatory and political developments, the overall financial performance of our reporting units including cost factors and budgeted-to-actual revenue results.
21510_12_ITEM7_P75_S2	We also considered market capitalization and stock price performance.
21510_12_ITEM7_P75_S3	Based on our assessment, goodwill in the reporting units was not impaired as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 .
21510_12_ITEM7_P75_S4	As such, it was not necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test at that time.
21510_12_ITEM7_P75_S5	As no impairment indicators were present during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 , we believe these values remain recoverable.
21510_12_ITEM7_P75_S6	At September 29, 2012 , we had $77.7 million of goodwill, $9.5 million of purchased intangible assets and $115.1 million of property and equipment on our consolidated balance sheet.
21510_12_ITEM7_P76_S0	It is reasonably possible that the estimates of anticipated future net revenue, the remaining estimated economic life of the products and technologies, or both, could differ from those used to assess the recoverability of these assets in fiscal 2010.
21510_12_ITEM7_P76_S1	In addition, if the price of our common stock were to significantly decrease combined with any other adverse change in market conditions, thus indicating that the underlying fair value of our reporting units or other long-lived assets may have decreased, we may be required to assess the recoverability of such assets in the period such circumstances are identified.
21510_12_ITEM7_P76_S2	In that event, additional impairment charges or shortened useful lives of certain long-lived assets may be required.
21510_12_ITEM7_P77_S0	Inventory Valuation We record our inventory at the lower of cost (computed on a first-in, first-out basis) or market.
21510_12_ITEM7_P77_S1	We write-down our inventory to its estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
21510_12_ITEM7_P78_S0	demand and when individual parts have been in inventory for greater than 12 months.
21510_12_ITEM7_P78_S1	If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required which could materially affect our future results of operations.
21510_12_ITEM7_P78_S2	Due to rapidly changing forecasts and orders, additional write-downs for excess or obsolete inventory, while not currently expected, could be required in the future.
21510_12_ITEM7_P78_S3	In the event that alternative future uses of fully written down inventories are identified, we may experience better than normal profit margins when such inventory is sold.
21510_12_ITEM7_P78_S4	Differences between actual results and previous estimates of excess and obsolete inventory could materially affect our future results of operations.
21510_12_ITEM7_P79_S0	We write-down our demo inventory by amortizing the cost of demo inventory over a twenty month period starting from the fourth month after such inventory is placed in service.
21510_12_ITEM7_P79_S1	We provide warranties on certain of our product sales and allowances for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale.
21510_12_ITEM7_P79_S2	The determination of such allowances requires us to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty.
21510_12_ITEM7_P79_S3	We currently establish warranty reserves based on historical warranty costs for each product line.
21510_12_ITEM7_P79_S4	The weighted average warranty period covered is approximately 15 months.
21510_12_ITEM7_P79_S5	If actual return rates and/or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates, adjustments to cost of sales may be required in future periods.
21510_12_ITEM7_P80_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation using fair value.
21510_12_ITEM7_P80_S1	We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes Merton model and estimate the fair value of market-based performance restricted stock units granted using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
21510_12_ITEM7_P80_S2	We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.
21510_12_ITEM7_P80_S3	We amortize the fair value of stock options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods.
21510_12_ITEM7_P80_S4	We value service-based restricted stock units using the intrinsic value method and amortize the value on a straight-line basis over the restriction period.
21510_12_ITEM7_P80_S5	We value market-based performance restricted stock units using a Monte Carlo simulation model and amortize the value over the performance period, with no adjustment in future periods, based upon the actual shareholder return over the performance period.
21510_12_ITEM7_P81_S0	U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") requires the use of option pricing models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options.
21510_12_ITEM7_P82_S0	The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short-lived exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
21510_12_ITEM7_P82_S1	In addition, option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the options expected life, the expected price volatility of the underlying stock and an estimate of expected forfeitures.
21510_12_ITEM7_P83_S0	Our computation of expected volatility considers historical volatility and market-based implied volatility.
21510_12_ITEM7_P83_S1	Our estimate of expected forfeitures is based on historical employee data and could differ from actual forfeitures.
21510_12_ITEM7_P83_S2	See Note 14 "Employee Stock Option and Benefit Plans" in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of this annual report for a description of our stock-based employee compensation plans and the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of stock-based employee compensation.
21510_12_ITEM7_P84_S0	Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income tax provision (benefit) in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
21510_12_ITEM7_P84_S1	This process involves us estimating our current income tax provision (benefit) together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
21510_12_ITEM7_P84_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets.
21510_12_ITEM7_P85_S0	We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized.
21510_12_ITEM7_P85_S1	While we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made.
21510_12_ITEM7_P85_S2	Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.
21510_12_ITEM7_P86_S0	Federal income taxes have not been provided for on a portion of the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested.
21510_12_ITEM7_P86_S1	The total amount of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which we have not yet recorded federal and state income taxes was approximately $270 million at fiscal 2012 year-end.
21510_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
21510_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
21510_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Interest rate sensitivity A portion of our investment portfolio is composed of fixed income securities.
21510_12_ITEM7A_P1_S1	These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase.
21510_12_ITEM7A_P1_S2	If interest rates were to increase immediately (whether due to changes in overall market rates or credit worthiness of the issuers of our individual securities) and uniformly by 10% from levels at fiscal 2012 year-end, the fair value of the portfolio, based on quoted market prices in active markets involving similar assets, would decline by an immaterial amount due to their short-term maturities.
21510_12_ITEM7A_P1_S3	We have the ability to generally hold our fixed income investments until maturity and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio.
21510_12_ITEM7A_P1_S4	If necessary, we may sell short-term investments prior to maturity to meet our liquidity needs.
21510_12_ITEM7A_P1_S5	At fiscal 2012 year-end, the fair value of our available-for-sale debt securities was $155.1 million, all of which was classified as short-term investments.
21510_12_ITEM7A_P1_S6	Gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities were $952,000 and $(3,000) , respectively, at fiscal 2012 year-end.
21510_12_ITEM7A_P1_S7	At fiscal 2011 year-end, the fair value of our available-for-sale debt securities was $46.6 million, all of which was classified as short-term investments.
21510_12_ITEM7A_P1_S8	Gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities were $276,000 and ($27,000), respectively, at fiscal 2011 year-end.
21510_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Foreign currency exchange risk We maintain operations in various countries outside of the United States and have foreign subsidiaries that manufacture and sell our products in various global markets.
21510_12_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The majority of our sales are transacted in U.S. dollars.
21510_12_ITEM7A_P2_S2	However, we do generate revenues in other currencies, primarily the Japanese Yen, the Euro and the Korean Won.
21510_12_ITEM7A_P2_S3	As a result, our earnings, cash flows and cash balances are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
21510_12_ITEM7A_P2_S4	We attempt to limit these exposures through financial market instruments.
21510_12_ITEM7A_P2_S5	We utilize derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts with maturities of two months or less, to manage our exposure associated with anticipated cash flows and net asset and liability positions denominated in foreign currencies.
21510_12_ITEM7A_P2_S6	Gains and losses on the forward contracts are mitigated by gains and losses on the underlying instruments.
21510_12_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
21510_12_ITEM7A_P3_S1	We do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments.
21510_12_ITEM7A_P3_S2	There can be no assurance that these strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately.
21510_12_ITEM7A_P4_S0	If a financial counterparty to any of our hedging arrangements experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge, we may experience material financial losses.
21510_12_ITEM7A_P5_S0	In the current economic environment, the risk of failure of a financial party remains high.
21510_12_ITEM7A_P6_S0	At September 29, 2012, approximately $139.4 million of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were held outside the U.S. in certain of our foreign operations, $46.1 million of which was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
21510_12_ITEM7A_P6_S1	In J anuary 2012, we converted $89.8 million of assets formerly denominated in Euro to U.S. dollars and invested those funds in U.S. Treasury securities within a European subsidiary whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar.
21510_12_ITEM7A_P6_S2	Accordingly, there is no translation adjustment arising from these U.S. dollar denominated investments.
21510_12_ITEM7A_P7_S0	A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
21510_12_ITEM7A_P8_S0	The following table provides information about our foreign exchange forward contracts at September 29, 2012 .
21510_12_ITEM7A_P8_S1	The table presents the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates, the value of the contracts in U.S. dollars at the contract exchange rate as of the contract maturity date and fair value.
21510_12_ITEM7A_P8_S2	The U.S. notional fair value represents the contracted amount valued at September 29, 2012 rates.
21510_12_ITEM7A_P9_S0	Forward contracts to sell (buy) foreign currencies for U.S. dollars (in thousands, except contract rates):
21510_12_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures; as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by this annual report ("Evaluation Date").
21510_12_ITEM9A_P0_S1	The controls evaluation was done under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.
21510_12_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
21510_12_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the Company.
21510_12_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2012 , utilizing the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.
21510_12_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on the assessment by management, we determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 29, 2012 .
21510_12_ITEM9A_P1_S3	The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2012 has been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears below.
21510_12_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
21510_12_ITEM9A_P2_S1	The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company's assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the Company's receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company's management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
21510_12_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that the Company's internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud.
21510_12_ITEM9A_P3_S0	A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
21510_12_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
21510_12_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
21510_12_ITEM9A_P3_S3	Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
21510_12_ITEM9A_P3_S4	There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 29, 2012 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
21510_12_ITEM9A_P4_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Coherent, Inc.: We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Coherent, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") as of September 29, 2012 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
21510_12_ITEM9A_P4_S1	The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
21510_12_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
21510_12_ITEM9A_P4_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
21510_12_ITEM9A_P4_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
21510_12_ITEM9A_P4_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
21510_12_ITEM9A_P4_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
21510_12_ITEM9A_P5_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
21510_12_ITEM9A_P5_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
21510_12_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
21510_12_ITEM9A_P5_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
21510_12_ITEM9A_P5_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2012 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
21510_12_ITEM9A_P5_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 29, 2012 , of the Company and our report dated November 28, 2012, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and includes an explanatory paragraph relating to the Company's adoption of new accounting guidance for the presentation of comprehensive income.

21510_12_ITEM15_P6_S1	The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and reflect the effects of certain estimates and judgments made by management.
21510_12_ITEM15_P6_S2	It is critical for investors and other users of the Consolidated Financial Statements to have confidence that the financial information that we provide is timely, complete, relevant and accurate Management, with oversight by the Company's Board of Directors, has established and maintains a corporate culture that requires that the Company's affairs be conducted to the highest standards of business ethics and conduct.
21510_12_ITEM15_P6_S3	Management also maintains a system of internal control that is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that transactions are properly recorded and executed in accordance with management's authorization.
21510_12_ITEM15_P6_S4	This system is regularly monitored through direct management review, as well as extensive audits conducted by internal auditors throughout the organization.
21510_12_ITEM15_P6_S5	Our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended September 29, 2012 have been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm.
21510_12_ITEM15_P6_S6	Their audit was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and included an integrated audit under such standards.
21510_12_ITEM15_P7_S0	The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors meets regularly with management, the internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm to review accounting, reporting, auditing and internal control matters.
21510_12_ITEM15_P7_S1	The Audit Committee has direct and private access to both internal and external auditors.
21510_12_ITEM15_P7_S2	See Item 9A for Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financing Reporting.
21510_12_ITEM15_P8_S0	We are committed to enhancing shareholder value and fully understand and embrace our fiduciary oversight responsibilities.
21510_12_ITEM15_P8_S1	We are dedicated to ensuring that our high standards of financial accounting and reporting as well as our underlying system of internal controls are maintained.
21510_12_ITEM15_P8_S2	Our culture demands integrity and we have the highest confidence in our processes, internal controls, and people, who are objective in their responsibilities and operate under the highest level of ethical standards.
21510_12_ITEM15_P9_S0	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Coherent, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Coherent, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") as of September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011 , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2012 .
21510_12_ITEM15_P9_S1	These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
21510_12_ITEM15_P9_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
21510_12_ITEM15_P9_S3	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
21510_12_ITEM15_P9_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
21510_12_ITEM15_P10_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
21510_12_ITEM15_P10_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
21510_12_ITEM15_P10_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
21510_12_ITEM15_P10_S3	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2012 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
21510_12_ITEM15_P11_S0	As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has retrospectively adopted new accounting guidance related to the presentation of comprehensive income.
21510_12_ITEM15_P11_S1	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2012 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 28, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
21510_12_ITEM15_P12_S0	See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
21510_12_ITEM15_P13_S0	See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

21510_12_ITEM15_P14_S1	Tax expense (benefit) on changes in unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities and on net loss realized on derivative instruments was insignificant.
21510_12_ITEM15_P15_S0	DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Founded in 1966, Coherent, Inc. provides photonics-based solutions in a broad range of commercial and scientific research applications.
21510_12_ITEM15_P15_S1	We design, manufacture, service and market lasers, laser tools and related accessories for a diverse group of customers.
21510_12_ITEM15_P15_S2	Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, the Company has worldwide operations including research and development, manufacturing, sales, service and support capabilities.
21510_12_ITEM15_P16_S0	Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30.
21510_12_ITEM15_P16_S1	Fiscal years 2012 , 2011 and 2010 ended on September 29, 2012 , October 1, 2011 and October 2, 2010 , respectively, and are referred to in these financial statements as fiscal 2012 , fiscal 2011 , and fiscal 2010 for convenience.
21510_12_ITEM15_P16_S2	All fiscal years include 52 weeks.
21510_12_ITEM15_P16_S3	Accordingly, the financial statements of these subsidiaries as of that date and for the years then ended have been used for our consolidated financial statements.
21510_12_ITEM15_P16_S4	Management believes that the impact of the use of different year-ends is immaterial to our consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.
21510_12_ITEM15_P17_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
21510_12_ITEM15_P17_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
21510_12_ITEM15_P18_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Coherent, Inc. and its majority-owned subsidiaries (collectively, "the Company", "we", "our", or "Coherent").
21510_12_ITEM15_P18_S1	Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
21510_12_ITEM15_P19_S0	Investments in business entities in which we do not have control, but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies (generally 20% - 50% ownership) are accounted for by the equity method.
21510_12_ITEM15_P19_S1	We currently do not have any investments accounted for by the equity method.
21510_12_ITEM15_P19_S2	The carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
21510_12_ITEM15_P20_S0	Short-term investments are comprised of available-for-sale securities, which are carried at fair value.
21510_12_ITEM15_P20_S1	Other non-current assets include trading securities and life insurance contracts related to our deferred compensation plans; trading securities are carried at fair value and life insurance contracts are carried at cash surrender values, which due to their ability to be converted to cash at that amount, approximate their fair values.
21510_12_ITEM15_P20_S2	The recorded carrying amount of our long-term obligations approximates fair value at fiscal 2012 and 2011 year-ends.
21510_12_ITEM15_P21_S0	Foreign exchange contracts are stated at fair value based on prevailing financial market information.
21510_12_ITEM15_P22_S0	Cash Equivalents All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.
21510_12_ITEM15_P23_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that may potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable.
21510_12_ITEM15_P23_S1	At fiscal 2012 year-end, the majority of our short-term investments are in US Treasury and federal agency obligations and corporate notes and obligations.
21510_12_ITEM15_P23_S2	Cash equivalents and short-term investments are maintained with several financial institutions and may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such balances.
21510_12_ITEM15_P23_S3	At September 29, 2012 , we held cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments outside the U.S. in certain of our foreign operations totaling approximately $139.4 million , $46.1 million of which was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
21510_12_ITEM15_P24_S0	The majority of our accounts receivable are derived from sales to customers for commercial applications.
21510_12_ITEM15_P24_S1	We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition and limit the amount of credit extended when deemed necessary but generally require no collateral.
21510_12_ITEM15_P24_S2	We maintain reserves for potential credit losses.

21510_12_ITEM15_P26_S1	No customers accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable at fiscal 2011 year-end.
21510_12_ITEM15_P27_S0	Accounts Receivable Allowances Accounts receivable allowances reflect our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our accounts receivable balances.
21510_12_ITEM15_P27_S1	We regularly review allowances by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality, the age of the accounts receivable balances and current economic conditions that may affect a customer's ability to pay.
21510_12_ITEM15_P28_S0	Activity in accounts receivable allowance is as follows (in thousands):

21510_12_ITEM15_P31_S0	The fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.
21510_12_ITEM15_P31_S1	The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset.

21510_12_ITEM15_P33_S1	We estimated that as of fiscal 2012 year-end, gross expected future cash flows of $2.3 million would be required to fulfill these obligations.
21510_12_ITEM15_P33_S2	The following table reconciles changes in our asset retirement liability for fiscal 2012 and 2011 (in thousands):
21510_12_ITEM15_P34_S0	At September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011 , the asset retirement liability is included in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
21510_12_ITEM15_P35_S0	Long-lived Assets We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, whenever events or changes in business circumstances or our planned use of long-lived assets indicate that their carrying amounts may not be fully recoverable or that their useful lives are no longer appropriate.
21510_12_ITEM15_P35_S1	Reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying values of long-lived assets are impaired based on a comparison to the undiscounted expected future net cash flows.
21510_12_ITEM15_P35_S2	If the comparison indicates that impairment exists, long-lived assets that are classified as held and used are written down to their respective fair values.
21510_12_ITEM15_P36_S0	When long-lived assets are classified as held for sale, they are written down to their respective fair values less costs to sell.
21510_12_ITEM15_P36_S1	Significant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that is used in the preparation of expected undiscounted cash flows.
21510_12_ITEM15_P36_S2	For fiscal years 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , there were no significant asset impairments recorded.
21510_12_ITEM15_P36_S3	Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and written down when impaired (see Note 8.
21510_12_ITEM15_P37_S0	In testing for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50% ) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
21510_12_ITEM15_P37_S1	We elected to perform this qualitative testing in fiscal 2012 , and noted no impairment.
21510_12_ITEM15_P37_S2	If this had not been the case, we would have needed to perform a more detailed two-step goodwill impairment test as was done in prior year which is used to identify potential goodwill impairments and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment losses to be recognized, if any.
21510_12_ITEM15_P38_S0	In a step 2 calculation, goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the respective fair value with the respective carrying value of the reporting unit.
21510_12_ITEM15_P38_S1	Fair value is then determined using the Income Approach (discounted cash flow approach) valuation methodology.
21510_12_ITEM15_P38_S2	Absent any impairment indicators, we perform our annual impairment tests during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year using opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter, with any resulting impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.
21510_12_ITEM15_P39_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets, including acquired existing technology, patents, customer lists, trade name, non-compete agreements and production know-how, are amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of one year to fifteen years.
21510_12_ITEM15_P39_S1	We provide warranties on certain of our product sales and reserves for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale.
21510_12_ITEM15_P39_S2	The determination of such reserves requires us to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty.
21510_12_ITEM15_P40_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2.
21510_12_ITEM15_P41_S0	The weighted average warranty period covered is approximately 15 months.
21510_12_ITEM15_P41_S1	If actual return rates and/or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates, adjustments to cost of sales may be required in future periods.
21510_12_ITEM15_P42_S0	Components of the reserve for warranty costs during fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 were as follows (in thousands):
21510_12_ITEM15_P43_S0	Revenue Recognition In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued a new accounting standard for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements.
21510_12_ITEM15_P43_S1	The new standard changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable to be based on the relative selling price.
21510_12_ITEM15_P43_S2	The FASB also issued a new accounting standard for certain revenue arrangements that include software elements.
21510_12_ITEM15_P43_S3	This new standard excludes software that is contained on a tangible product from the scope of software revenue guidance if the software is essential to the tangible product's functionality.
21510_12_ITEM15_P43_S4	We prospectively adopted both these standards in the first quarter of fiscal 2011.
21510_12_ITEM15_P43_S5	The impact of adopting these standards was not material to net sales or our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2011.
21510_12_ITEM15_P43_S6	The new accounting standards for revenue recognition if applied in the same manner to fiscal 2010 would not have had a material impact on net sales or to our consolidated financial statements for that fiscal year.
21510_12_ITEM15_P44_S0	Under these standards, when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements, such as products and/or services, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy.
21510_12_ITEM15_P45_S0	Using the selling price hierarchy, we determine the selling price of each deliverable using vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ), if it exists, and otherwise third-party evidence ( TPE ).
21510_12_ITEM15_P45_S1	If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exists, we use estimated selling price ( ESP ).
21510_12_ITEM15_P45_S2	We generally expect that we will not be able to establish TPE due to the nature of the markets in which we compete, and, as such, we typically will determine selling price using VSOE or if not available, ESP.
21510_12_ITEM15_P46_S0	Our basis for establishing VSOE of a deliverable's selling price consists of standalone sales transactions when the same or similar product or service is sold separately.
21510_12_ITEM15_P46_S1	However, when services are never sold separately, such as product installation services, VSOE is based on the product's estimated installation hours based on historical experience multiplied by the standard service billing rate.
21510_12_ITEM15_P47_S0	In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling price for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow price range, as defined by us.
21510_12_ITEM15_P47_S1	We also consider the geographies in which the products or services are sold, major product and service groups, and other environmental variables in determining VSOE.
21510_12_ITEM15_P47_S2	Absent the existence of VSOE and TPE, our determination of a deliverable's ESP involves evaluating several factors based on the specific facts and circumstances of these arrangements, which include pricing strategy and policies driven by geographies, market conditions, competitive landscape, correlation between proportionate selling price and list price established by management having the relevant authority, and other environmental variables in which the deliverable is sold.
21510_12_ITEM15_P48_S0	For multiple element arrangements which include extended maintenance contracts, we allocate and defer the amount of consideration equal to the separately stated price and recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
21510_12_ITEM15_P48_S1	We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered or the service has been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured.
21510_12_ITEM15_P48_S2	Revenue from product sales is recorded when all of the foregoing conditions are met and risk of loss and title passes to the customer.
21510_12_ITEM15_P48_S3	Sales to customers are generally not subject to any price protection or return rights.
21510_12_ITEM15_P48_S4	The vast majority of our sales are made to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), distributors, resellers and end-users in the non-scientific market.
21510_12_ITEM15_P49_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2.
21510_12_ITEM15_P50_S0	subject to other post-delivery obligations, except in occasional instances where we have agreed to perform installation or provide training.
21510_12_ITEM15_P50_S1	In those instances, we defer revenue related to installation services or training until these services have been rendered.
21510_12_ITEM15_P50_S2	We allocate revenue from multiple element arrangements to the various elements based upon relative fair values.
21510_12_ITEM15_P50_S3	Our sales to distributors, resellers and end-user customers typically do not have customer acceptance provisions and only certain of our sales to OEM customers and integrators have customer acceptance provisions.
21510_12_ITEM15_P50_S4	Customer acceptance is generally limited to performance under our published product specifications.
21510_12_ITEM15_P50_S5	For the few product sales that have customer acceptance provisions because of higher than published specifications, (1) the products are tested and accepted by the customer at our site or by the customer's acceptance of the results of our testing program prior to shipment to the customer, or (2) the revenue is deferred until customer acceptance occurs.
21510_12_ITEM15_P51_S0	Sales to end-users in the scientific market typically require installation and, thus, involve post-delivery obligations; however, our post-delivery installation obligations are not essential to the functionality of our products.
21510_12_ITEM15_P51_S1	We defer revenue related to installation services until completion of these services.
21510_12_ITEM15_P52_S0	For most products, training is not provided; therefore, no post-delivery training obligation exists.
21510_12_ITEM15_P52_S1	However, when training is provided to our customers, it is typically priced separately and is recognized as revenue as these services are provided.
21510_12_ITEM15_P53_S0	We record taxes collected on revenue-producing activities on a net basis.
21510_12_ITEM15_P53_S1	Research and Development Research and development expenses include salaries, contractor and consultant fees, supplies and materials, as well as costs related to other overhead such as depreciation, facilities, utilities and other departmental expenses.
21510_12_ITEM15_P53_S2	The costs we incur with respect to internally developed technology and engineering services are included in research and development expenses as incurred as they do not directly relate to any particular licensee, license agreement or license fee.
21510_12_ITEM15_P53_S3	We treat third party and government funding of our research and development activity, where we are the primary beneficiary of such work conducted, as a credit to research and development cost.
21510_12_ITEM15_P53_S4	Amounts offset against research and development costs were not material in any of the periods presented.
21510_12_ITEM15_P54_S0	The functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are generally their respective local currencies.
21510_12_ITEM15_P54_S1	Accordingly, gains and losses from the translation of the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income ("OCI").
21510_12_ITEM15_P54_S2	Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in earnings.
21510_12_ITEM15_P55_S0	Derivatives U.S. GAAP requires that all derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.
21510_12_ITEM15_P55_S1	If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings.
21510_12_ITEM15_P55_S2	If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of the changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in OCI and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings.
21510_12_ITEM15_P55_S3	Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in other income (expense).
21510_12_ITEM15_P56_S0	Our objective of holding derivatives is to minimize the risks of foreign currency fluctuation by using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impact of these exposures.
21510_12_ITEM15_P57_S0	Principal currencies hedged include the Euro, Korean Won, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Chinese Renminbi and Singapore dollar.
21510_12_ITEM15_P57_S1	Forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to hedge the impact of the variability in exchange rates on accounts receivable and collections denominated in certain foreign currencies.
21510_12_ITEM15_P58_S0	Our forward contracts have maturities of two months or less and changes in fair value of these derivatives are recognized in other income (expense).

21510_12_ITEM15_P60_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period, excluding unvested restricted stock.
21510_12_ITEM15_P60_S1	Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period increased by the effect of dilutive employee stock awards, including stock options, restricted stock awards and stock purchase contracts, using the treasury stock method.
21510_12_ITEM15_P60_S2	The following table presents information necessary to calculate basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share (in thousands, except per share data):
21510_12_ITEM15_P61_S0	_______________________________________ (1) Net of unvested restricted stock A total of 99,912 ; 2,416 and 1,221,143 potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the dilutive share calculation for fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively, as their effect was anti-dilutive.
21510_12_ITEM15_P62_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation using the fair value of the awards granted.
21510_12_ITEM15_P62_S1	We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes Merton model.
21510_12_ITEM15_P62_S2	We value restricted stock units using the intrinsic value method.
21510_12_ITEM15_P62_S3	We use a Monte Carlo model to estimate the fair value of market-based performance restricted stock units.
21510_12_ITEM15_P62_S4	We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option and restricted stock unit forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those options and awards that are expected to vest.
21510_12_ITEM15_P62_S5	We amortize the fair value of stock options and awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods.
21510_12_ITEM15_P62_S6	See Note 14 "Employee Stock Option and Benefit Plans" for a description of our stock-based employee compensation plans and the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of stock-based employee compensation.
21510_12_ITEM15_P63_S0	We record costs related to shipping and handling of revenue in cost of sales for all periods presented.
21510_12_ITEM15_P63_S1	Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were $3.5 million , $4.1 million and $2.6 million in fiscal 2012 , fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 , respectively.
21510_12_ITEM15_P64_S0	Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income tax provision (benefit) in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
21510_12_ITEM15_P64_S1	This process involves us estimating our current income tax provision (benefit) together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
21510_12_ITEM15_P64_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets.
21510_12_ITEM15_P65_S0	We account for uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740-10 (formerly FASB Financial Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes ), which creates a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.
21510_12_ITEM15_P65_S1	This standard provides a two-step approach for evaluating tax positions.
21510_12_ITEM15_P66_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2.
21510_12_ITEM15_P67_S0	when a company concludes (based solely on the technical aspects of the matter) that a tax provision is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority.
21510_12_ITEM15_P67_S1	The second step, measurement, is only considered after step one has been satisfied and measures any tax benefit at the largest amount that is deemed more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the uncertainty.
21510_12_ITEM15_P67_S2	These determinations involve significant judgment by management.
21510_12_ITEM15_P67_S3	Tax positions that fail to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first subsequent interim period that they meet the more likely than not standard or when they are resolved through negotiation or litigation with factual interpretation, judgment and certainty.
21510_12_ITEM15_P68_S0	Tax laws and regulations themselves are complex and are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, evolution of regulations and court filings.
21510_12_ITEM15_P68_S1	Therefore, the actual liability for U.S. or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially to reverse previously recorded tax liabilities.
21510_12_ITEM15_P69_S0	We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized.
21510_12_ITEM15_P69_S1	While we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made.
21510_12_ITEM15_P69_S2	Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.
21510_12_ITEM15_P70_S0	Federal income taxes have not been provided for on a portion of the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested.
21510_12_ITEM15_P70_S1	The total amount of unremitted earnings and accumulated translation adjustments of foreign subsidiaries for which we have not yet recorded federal and state income taxes was approximately $270 million and $40 million respectively, at fiscal 2012 year-end.
21510_12_ITEM15_P70_S2	The amount of federal and state income taxes that would be payable upon repatriation of such earnings are not practicably determinable.
21510_12_ITEM15_P71_S0	In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued additional guidance on fair value measurements that clarified the application of existing guidance and disclosure requirements, changed certain fair value measurement principles and required additional disclosures about fair value measurements.
21510_12_ITEM15_P71_S1	We adopted this standard on a prospective basis in the second quarter of fiscal 2012.
21510_12_ITEM15_P71_S2	The adoption of this accounting standard did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
21510_12_ITEM15_P72_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued a final standard requiring the presentation of net income and other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive, statements of net income and other comprehensive income.
21510_12_ITEM15_P72_S1	The new standard eliminated the option previously elected by the Company to present items of other comprehensive income in the annual statement of changes in stockholders' equity.
21510_12_ITEM15_P72_S2	The new requirements did not change the components of comprehensive income recognized in net income or other comprehensive income, or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income.
21510_12_ITEM15_P72_S3	Earnings per share computations do not change.
21510_12_ITEM15_P72_S4	We adopted this standard on a full retrospective basis, as required, in the second quarter of fiscal 2012 .
21510_12_ITEM15_P72_S5	As this standard relates only to the presentation of other comprehensive income, the adoption of this accounting standard did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
21510_12_ITEM15_P73_S0	In September 2011, the FASB amended existing guidance related to goodwill and other intangible assets by giving an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
21510_12_ITEM15_P73_S1	The qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance which requires goodwill of a reporting unit to be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.
21510_12_ITEM15_P73_S2	If this is the case, companies will need to perform a more detailed two-step goodwill impairment test which is used to identify potential goodwill impairments and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment losses to be recognized, if any.
21510_12_ITEM15_P73_S3	We adopted this authoritative guidance and used this qualitative approach for our annual impairment testing in fiscal 2012 , which we perform annually as of the first day of the fourth quarter.
21510_12_ITEM15_P74_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2.
21510_12_ITEM15_P75_S0	testing an indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount.
21510_12_ITEM15_P75_S1	If the entity determines, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not more likely than not impaired, the entity would not need to calculate the fair value of the asset.
21510_12_ITEM15_P75_S2	The guidance does not revise the requirement to test indefinite-lived intangible assets annually for impairment or to test these assets for impairment between annual tests if there is a change in events or circumstances.
21510_12_ITEM15_P75_S3	This amended guidance was effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012.
21510_12_ITEM15_P75_S4	We will adopt this authoritative guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 .
21510_12_ITEM15_P75_S5	As of September 29, 2012 , we did not have any indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded in our consolidated balance sheet; accordingly, we do not expect the implementation of this authoritative guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows in connection with our impairment testing.
21510_12_ITEM15_P76_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance which requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable financial statement users to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements, including rights of setoff associated with the entity's recognized financial assets and liabilities, on the entity's financial position.
21510_12_ITEM15_P76_S1	The new disclosures will enable financial statement users to compare balance sheets prepared under U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS"), which are subject to different offsetting models.
21510_12_ITEM15_P76_S2	The disclosures will be limited to financial instruments (and derivatives) subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements.
21510_12_ITEM15_P76_S3	Similar agreements include derivative clearing agreements, global master repurchase agreements, and global master securities lending agreements.
21510_12_ITEM15_P76_S4	Financial instruments and transactions that will be subject to the disclosure requirements may include derivatives, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities lending and borrowing arrangements.
21510_12_ITEM15_P76_S5	An entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented.
21510_12_ITEM15_P76_S6	The guidance is effective for us beginning in fiscal 2014.
21510_12_ITEM15_P76_S7	We are currently evaluating the additional disclosures required, if any, from the adoption of this guidance.
21510_12_ITEM15_P77_S0	RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we announced our plans to close our facilities in Tampere, Finland and St. Louis, Missouri.
21510_12_ITEM15_P77_S1	The closure of our St. Louis site was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.
21510_12_ITEM15_P77_S2	The closure of our Finland site was scheduled for completion by the end of fiscal 2010, but we delayed the closure due to increased demand for products manufactured in Finland.
21510_12_ITEM15_P77_S3	In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we ceased manufacturing operations in our Finland facility and recognized a $6.1 million gain, primarily in other income (expense), due to a non-recurring translation adjustment related to the dissolution of our Finland operations.
21510_12_ITEM15_P77_S4	We exited the facility in the third quarter of fiscal 2011.
21510_12_ITEM15_P77_S5	These closure plans resulted in charges primarily for employee termination and other exit related costs associated with a plan approved by management.
21510_12_ITEM15_P78_S0	During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we acquired the assets and certain liabilities of StockerYale, Inc's laser module product line in Montreal, Canada and transitioned those activities to other Coherent facilities in Salem, Massachusetts, Wilsonville, Oregon and Sunnyvale, California.
21510_12_ITEM15_P78_S1	The transfer was completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2011.
21510_12_ITEM15_P78_S2	These closure plans resulted in charges primarily for employee termination and other exit related costs associated with a plan approved by management.
21510_12_ITEM15_P78_S3	There were no new restructuring charges during fiscal 2012 .
21510_12_ITEM15_P78_S4	Restructuring charges during fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 are recorded in cost of sales, research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations.

21510_12_ITEM15_P81_S0	On July 23, 2012 , we acquired all of the outstanding shares of MiDAZ Lasers Ltd "Midaz" for approximately $3.8 million , excluding transaction fees.
21510_12_ITEM15_P81_S1	We intend to utilize the acquired technology in low cost, compact pulsed solid state lasers.
21510_12_ITEM15_P81_S2	Midaz has been included in our Specialty Lasers and Systems segment.
21510_12_ITEM15_P82_S0	Our allocation of the purchase price is as follows (in thousands):
21510_12_ITEM15_P83_S0	Results of operations for the business have been included in our consolidated financial statements subsequent to the date of acquisition and pro forma results of operations in accordance with authoritative guidance for prior periods have not been presented because the effect of the acquisition was not material to our prior period consolidated financial results.
21510_12_ITEM15_P84_S0	None of the goodwill from this purchase is deductible for tax purposes.
21510_12_ITEM15_P85_S0	The identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over their respective useful life of seven years.
21510_12_ITEM15_P86_S0	We expensed $0.2 million of acquisition-related costs as selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations in the fiscal year ended September 29, 2012 .

21510_12_ITEM15_P93_S0	In-process research and development ( IPR D ) consisted of seven interrelated projects to be incorporated into one product and had not yet reached technological feasibility at the time of purchase.
21510_12_ITEM15_P93_S1	Acquired IPR D assets are initially recognized at fair value and are classified as indefinite-lived assets until the successful completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts.
21510_12_ITEM15_P93_S2	The value assigned to IPR D was determined by considering the value of the products under development to the overall development plan, estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows to their present value.
21510_12_ITEM15_P93_S3	During the development period, these assets will not be amortized as charges to earnings; instead these assets will be subject to periodic impairment testing.
21510_12_ITEM15_P93_S4	Upon successful completion of the development process for the acquired IPR D projects, the assets would then be considered finite-lived intangible assets and amortization of the assets will commence.
21510_12_ITEM15_P94_S0	During the second quarter of fiscal 2012 , we determined that one of the hardware projects classified as IPR D acquired from Hypertronics would not be completed.
21510_12_ITEM15_P94_S1	As a result, $0.2 million was expensed in the second fiscal quarter for that project.

21510_12_ITEM15_P96_S0	determined that an impairment review of the intangible assets was required.
21510_12_ITEM15_P96_S1	As a result of our analysis, we determined that the intangible assets were fully impaired and that the remaining hardware projects classified as IPR D acquired from Hypertronics would not be completed.
21510_12_ITEM15_P96_S2	As a result, we recorded a $4.0 million charge in amortization expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 .
21510_12_ITEM15_P96_S3	We also wrote off $0.3 million of inventory unique to these products that were not expected to be resold.

21510_12_ITEM15_P128_S0	GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have occurred, and we write down these assets when impaired.
21510_12_ITEM15_P128_S1	We perform our annual impairment tests during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter, with any resulting impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.
21510_12_ITEM15_P129_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination.
21510_12_ITEM15_P129_S1	In September 2011, the FASB amended its guidance to simplify testing goodwill for impairment, allowing an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.
21510_12_ITEM15_P129_S2	If an entity determines as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not ( 50% likelihood) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative test is required.
21510_12_ITEM15_P129_S3	Otherwise, no further testing is required.

21510_12_ITEM15_P131_S0	Coherent has two reporting units: Commercial Lasers and Components and Specialty Laser Systems.
21510_12_ITEM15_P131_S1	The fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of its estimated carrying amount as of the most recent quantitative analysis of goodwill impairment performed using the opening balance sheet as of fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 .
21510_12_ITEM15_P131_S2	Under the goodwill standards in effect for fiscal 2011 , we determined that we had met the requirements of the goodwill standard for carrying forward our fair value determination from fiscal 2010, and did not perform detailed calculation of the fair value of our reporting units for fiscal 2011, but rather compared the fair values calculated in the prior year to the 2011 carrying values of our reporting units; based on our evaluation, the fair values of each of the two operating segments significantly exceeded their carrying value as of that date.
21510_12_ITEM15_P131_S3	Between the completion of that testing and the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2012 , we noted no indications of impairment or triggering events to cause us to review goodwill for potential impairment.
21510_12_ITEM15_P131_S4	There were no triggering events or changes in circumstances subsequent to that quantitative analysis to indicate that the fair value of either of Coherent's reporting units would be less than its carrying amount.
21510_12_ITEM15_P132_S0	In our fiscal 2012 annual testing, we performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying amount.
21510_12_ITEM15_P132_S1	In assessing the qualitative factors, we considered the impact of these key factors: macroeconomic conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency, market and industry conditions, our operating and competitive environment, regulatory and political developments, the overall financial performance of our reporting units including cost factors and budgeted-to-actual revenue results.
21510_12_ITEM15_P132_S2	We also considered market capitalization and stock price performance.
21510_12_ITEM15_P132_S3	Based on our assessment, goodwill in the reporting units was not impaired as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 .
21510_12_ITEM15_P132_S4	As such, it was not necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test at that time.
21510_12_ITEM15_P132_S5	The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment for fiscal 2012 and 2011 are as follows (in thousands):
21510_12_ITEM15_P133_S0	(1) Gross amount of goodwill for our CLC segment was $25.7 million at September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011.
21510_12_ITEM15_P133_S1	For both periods, the accumulated impairment loss for the CLC segment was $19.3 million reflecting an impairment charge in fiscal 2009.
21510_12_ITEM15_P133_S2	(2) The gross amount of goodwill for our SLS segment was $73.7 million and $72.0 million at September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011, respectively.
21510_12_ITEM15_P133_S3	For both periods, the accumulated impairment loss for the SLS segment was $2.4 million reflecting an impairment charge in fiscal 2003.
21510_12_ITEM15_P134_S0	We evaluate long-lived assets and amortizable intangible assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances or our planned use of assets indicate that their carrying amounts may not be fully recoverable or that their useful lives are no longer appropriate.
21510_12_ITEM15_P134_S1	Reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying values of assets are impaired based on comparison to the undiscounted expected future cash flows identifiable to such long-lived and amortizable intangible assets.
21510_12_ITEM15_P134_S2	If the comparison indicates that impairment exists, the impaired asset is written down to its fair value.
21510_12_ITEM15_P135_S0	During the second quarter of fiscal 2012 , we determined that one of the hardware projects classified as in-process research and development ("IPR D") acquired from Hypertronics would not be completed.
21510_12_ITEM15_P135_S1	As a result, $0.2 million was included in research and development expense in the second fiscal quarter for that project.
21510_12_ITEM15_P136_S0	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 , we decided to no longer pursue orders of Hypertronics legacy products and determined that the carrying amounts of the amortizable intangible assets, including the remaining IPR D, acquired from Hypertronics may not be recoverable and thus determined that an impairment review of the intangible assets was required.

21510_12_ITEM15_P138_S1	As a result, we recorded a $4.0 million charge in amortization expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 .
21510_12_ITEM15_P138_S2	We also considered the valuation of the goodwill recorded upon the acquisition of Hypertronics (approximately $5.9 million at September 29, 2012) and determined that the goodwill was not impaired, and no write-off is warranted, as the goodwill is related to the key strategic purpose of our acquisition - expansion into the Asian market with the addition of a full manufacturing facility.
21510_12_ITEM15_P138_S3	The components of our amortizable intangible assets are as follows (in thousands):
21510_12_ITEM15_P139_S0	(1) For accounting purposes, when an intangible asset is fully amortized, it is removed from the disclosure schedule.
21510_12_ITEM15_P140_S0	Amortizable intangible assets include intangible assets acquired through business combinations as well as through direct purchases or licenses.
21510_12_ITEM15_P140_S1	All IPR D projects outstanding at the end of fiscal 2011 were either written off as discussed above, or completed during fiscal 2012 and reclassified to "existing technology" intangible assets with finite lives.
21510_12_ITEM15_P141_S0	The weighted average remaining amortization period for existing technology, customer lists, trade name, non-compete agreements and production know-how are approximately 4 years, 4 years, 1 year, 2 years and less than 1 year, respectively.
21510_12_ITEM15_P142_S0	Patents and order backlog are fully amortized.
21510_12_ITEM15_P142_S1	Amortization expense for intangible assets during fiscal years 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 was $10.4 million , $8.1 million and $8.0 million , respectively, which includes $6.6 million , $5.5 million and $5.5 million , respectively, for amortization of existing technology and production know-how.

21510_12_ITEM15_P166_S2	In prior years, we have had a Stock Plan for which employees and service providers were eligible participants and a non-employee Directors' Stock Option Plan for which only non-employee directors were eligible participants.

21510_12_ITEM15_P173_S0	The market-based performance restricted stock unit award grants are generally either subject to annual vesting over three years from the date of grant or subject to a single vest measurement three years from the date of grant, depending upon achievement of performance measurements ("Performance RSUs") based on the performance of the Company's Total Shareholder Returns (as defined) compared with the performance of the Russell 2000 Index.
21510_12_ITEM15_P173_S1	The Company previously granted Performance RSUs during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 which had a single vesting measurement date of November 14, 2010.
21510_12_ITEM15_P173_S2	These RSUs would have vested anywhere between 0% and 300% of the targeted amount based upon achievement by the Company of (a) an annual revenue threshold amount and (b) adjusted EBITDA percentage targets.
21510_12_ITEM15_P173_S3	The Company determined that the performance target had not been met and these awards were canceled in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 with no shares vesting.
21510_12_ITEM15_P174_S0	We recognize compensation expense for all share-based payment awards based on the fair value of such awards.

21510_12_ITEM15_P175_S2	The expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and was determined based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock-based awards, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior as influenced by changes to the terms of its stock-based awards.
21510_12_ITEM15_P175_S3	Our process for computing expected volatility considers both historical volatility and market-based implied volatility; however our estimate of expected forfeitures is based on historical employee data and could differ from actual forfeitures.
21510_12_ITEM15_P176_S0	The risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation method is based on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term.
21510_12_ITEM15_P177_S0	The expected dividend assumption is based on our current expectations about our anticipated dividend policy.

21510_12_ITEM15_P180_S2	The performance stock unit agreements provide for the award of performance stock units with each unit representing the right to receive one share of Coherent, Inc. common stock to be issued after the applicable award period.
21510_12_ITEM15_P180_S3	The final number of units awarded for this grant will be determined as of the vesting dates, based upon our total shareholder return over the performance period compared to the Russell 2000 Index and could range from a minimum of no units to a maximum of twice the initial award.
21510_12_ITEM15_P180_S4	The weighted average fair value for these performance units was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model incorporating the following weighted average assumptions:
21510_12_ITEM15_P181_S0	We recognize the estimated cost of these awards, as determined under the simulation model, over the related service period, with no adjustment in future periods based upon the actual shareholder return over the performance period.

21510_12_ITEM15_P200_S0	In determining our fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 tax provisions under ASC Subtopic 740, "Income Taxes", we calculated the deferred tax assets and liabilities for each separate tax entity.
21510_12_ITEM15_P200_S1	We then considered a number of factors including the positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of our deferred tax assets to determine whether a valuation allowance should be recognized with respect to our deferred tax assets.
21510_12_ITEM15_P200_S2	We determined that a valuation allowance was appropriate for a portion of the deferred tax assets of our California research and development tax credits, foreign tax attributes and net operating losses and capital loss carryforwards at fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 year-ends.
21510_12_ITEM15_P200_S3	During fiscal 2012 , we increased our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets to $9.1 million , primarily due to the reduced ability to utilize California research and development tax credits and offset by the net increased ability to utilize foreign tax attributes and net operating losses.

21510_12_ITEM15_P212_S0	This segmentation reflects the go-to-market strategies for various products and markets.
21510_12_ITEM15_P212_S1	While both segments work to deliver cost-effective solutions, CLC focuses on higher volume products that are offered in set configurations.
21510_12_ITEM15_P212_S2	The product architectures are designed for easy exchange at the point of use such that product service and repairs are based upon advanced replacement and depot (i.e., factory) repair.
21510_12_ITEM15_P213_S0	CLC's primary markets include materials processing, OEM components and instrumentation and microelectronics.
21510_12_ITEM15_P214_S0	SLS develops and manufacturers configurable, advanced-performance products largely serving the microelectronics, scientific research and government programs and OEM components and instrumentation markets.
21510_12_ITEM15_P214_S1	The size and complexity of many of our SLS products require service to be performed at the customer site by factory-trained field service engineers.

21510_12_ITEM15_P236_S0	The Company hereby grants to the Employee an award of Restricted Stock Units ( RSUs ), as set forth in the Notice of Grant, subject to the terms and conditions in this Agreement and in the Company's 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan ).
21510_12_ITEM15_P236_S1	Initially capitalized terms herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Plan or as defined herein, as applicable.
21510_12_ITEM15_P237_S0	Each RSU represents the right to receive a Share on the vesting date.
21510_12_ITEM15_P237_S1	Unless and until the RSUs vest, the Employee will have no right to receive Shares under such RSUs.
21510_12_ITEM15_P237_S2	Prior to actual distribution of Shares pursuant to any vested RSUs, such RSUs will represent an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable (if at all) only from the general assets of the Company.
21510_12_ITEM15_P238_S0	Vesting Schedule; Assumption or Substitution Calculation .
21510_12_ITEM15_P238_S1	The RSUs shall vest as follows:
21510_12_ITEM15_P239_S0	Up to the Maximum Amount will vest and be settled, based upon the extent, if any, to which the performance metric has been achieved.
21510_12_ITEM15_P240_S0	The performance metric is the relative performance of Company stock against the Russell 2000 index over a three-year period, with the target Company stock performance equivalent to the performance of the Russell 2000 index over such period.
21510_12_ITEM15_P240_S1	To determine relative performance, the baseline metrics are the 90 trading day average closing price of the Company and the Russell 2000 Index, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, or such other reliable source as is determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion, with the last of the 90 trading days falling on November 14, 2012.
21510_12_ITEM15_P240_S2	This 90 day average establishes both the Company baseline stock price (the Company Baseline Stock Price ) and the Russell 2000 Index baseline (the Russell 2000 Baseline ) against which future Company stock and Russell 2000 Index performance will be compared.
21510_12_ITEM15_P241_S0	Next, the Company will measure the 90 trading day average closing price of the Company and the Russell 2000 Index, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, or such other reliable source as is determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion, with the last trading day of such 90-trading day period ending on November 13, 2015 (establishing both the Company Closing Price and the Russell 2000 Index Closing Price ).
21510_12_ITEM15_P242_S0	The Company will then measure Company performance by dividing the Company Closing Price by the Company Baseline Stock Price, with the quotient expressed as a percentage of the Company Baseline Stock Price (the Company Percentage Performance ).
21510_12_ITEM15_P242_S1	The Company will then measure Russell 2000 Index Performance over the same period by dividing the Russell 2000 Index Closing Price by the Russell 2000 Index Baseline with the quotient expressed as a percentage of the Russell 2000 Index Baseline (the Russell 2000 Index Percentage Performance ).
21510_12_ITEM15_P243_S0	The Company will then subtract the Russell 2000 Index Percentage Performance from the Company Percentage Performance, then add 100 to the result, with the final result constituting the relative Company performance as a percentage (the Relative Performance Percentage ).
21510_12_ITEM15_P244_S0	If the Relative Performance Percentage is 50% or less, no RSUs shall vest.
21510_12_ITEM15_P244_S1	If the Relative Performance Percentage equals 51%, then 2% of the Target Amount shall vest.
21510_12_ITEM15_P244_S2	If the Relative Performance Percentage equals 70%, then 40% of the Target Amount shall vest.
21510_12_ITEM15_P244_S3	If the Relative Performance Percentage equals 100%, then the Target Amount shall vest.
21510_12_ITEM15_P244_S4	If the Relative Performance Percentage equals 150% or more, then 200% of the Target Amount shall vest (i.e., the Maximum Amount shall vest).
21510_12_ITEM15_P244_S5	Relative Performance Percentages shall result in incremental vesting on a straight-line basis within tiers based on full percentage Relative Performance Percentages as set forth below:
21510_12_ITEM15_P245_S0	The Company Closing Price shall be automatically adjusted to account for any Company stock split or similar change in capitalization effected without receipt of consideration by the Company set forth in Plan Section 19(a) in the same manner as set forth in Plan Section 19(a).
21510_12_ITEM15_P245_S1	In making determinations of the number of Shares that vest hereunder, all Relative Performance Percentage fractional percentages and Share numbers below .5 shall be rounded down to the nearest whole percentage or Share number, respectively and all Relative Performance Percentage fractional percentages and Share numbers of .5 or greater shall be rounded up to the nearest whole percentage or Share number, respectively.
21510_12_ITEM15_P245_S2	All vesting and delivery of Shares hereunder, except pursuant to assumed or substituted awards in a change of control as specified in the following paragraph, shall be subject to the prior written or electronic certification of the Compensation Committee of the Board as to the extent to which the applicable performance milestones have been achieved.
21510_12_ITEM15_P246_S0	In the event the Company is acquired in a merger or asset sale pursuant to which this RSU is assumed or substituted pursuant to Plan Section 19(c) (a Change of Control ), then if the performance period has not been completed as of the date of the Change of Control, the Company Closing Price shall be deemed to be the price per share received by the Company's stockholders in the Change of Control.
21510_12_ITEM15_P246_S1	Relative performance for such uncompleted performance period shall then be measured against the Russell 2000 Index performance from the Russell 2000 Index Baseline through the 90 trading day average closing price of the Russell 2000 Index in the period ending on the date of the Change of Control.
21510_12_ITEM15_P246_S2	The Company's stock performance relative to the Russell 2000 Index shall then be determined consistently with the methodology specified herein for completed performance period.
21510_12_ITEM15_P246_S3	The number of Shares subject to this RSU so determined shall then continue to vest based upon Employee's continuing as a Service Provider to the Company, the acquirer, or their Parents or Subsidiaries through November 13, 2015, subject to accelerated vesting as set forth in the Company's Change of Control Severance Plan (but only for participants in such plan), as amended from time to time.
21510_12_ITEM15_P247_S0	Vesting = 170% of the Target Amount vesting, subject to Employee's continuing as a Service Provider through November 13, 2015 and further subject to accelerated vesting as set forth in the Company's Change of Control Severance Plan (but only for participants in such plan), as amended from time to time.
21510_12_ITEM15_P248_S0	Forfeiture upon Termination as an Employee .
21510_12_ITEM15_P248_S1	Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement or the Notice of Grant, if the Employee terminates service as a Service Provider for any or no reason prior to vesting, the unvested RSUs awarded by this Agreement will thereupon be forfeited at no cost to the Company, subject to accelerated vesting as set forth in the Company's Change of Control Severance Plan (but only for participants in such plan), as amended from time to time.
21510_12_ITEM15_P249_S0	Any RSUs that vest in accordance with paragraph 3 will be distributed to the Employee (or in the event of the Employee's death, to his or her estate) in Shares.
21510_12_ITEM15_P250_S0	Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph 5, no Shares shall be distributed to Employee unless and until the Employee shall have delivered to the Company or its designated Subsidiary the full amount of any federal, state or local income or other taxes which the Company or such Subsidiary may be required by law to withhold with respect to such Shares.
21510_12_ITEM15_P250_S1	The Employee may elect to satisfy any such statutory minimum tax withholding requirement by having the Company withhold Shares otherwise deliverable to the Employee or by delivering to the Company already-owned Shares, subject to the absolute discretion of the Company to disallow satisfaction of such withholding by the delivery or withholding of stock.
21510_12_ITEM15_P251_S0	Neither the Employee nor any person claiming under or through the Employee will have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any Shares deliverable hereunder unless and until certificates representing such Shares will have been issued, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Employee or Employee's broker.

21510_12_ITEM15_P257_S0	The grant of the RSU, and any future grant of RSUs under the Plan is entirely voluntary, and at the complete discretion of the Company.
21510_12_ITEM15_P258_S0	Neither the grant of the RSU nor any future grant of an RSU by the Company will be deemed to create any obligation to grant any further RSUs, whether or not such a reservation is explicitly stated at the time of such a grant.

21510_13_ITEM1_P0_S0	Business Overview Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30.
21510_13_ITEM1_P0_S1	Fiscal years 2013 , 2012 and 2011 ended on September 28 , September 29 , and October 1 , respectively, and are referred to in this annual report as fiscal 2013 , fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 for convenience.
21510_13_ITEM1_P0_S2	Fiscal years 2013 , 2012 and 2011 included 52 weeks.
21510_13_ITEM1_P1_S0	We are one of the world's leading suppliers of photonics-based solutions in a broad range of commercial and scientific research applications.
21510_13_ITEM1_P1_S1	We design, manufacture, service and market lasers and related accessories for a diverse group of customers.
21510_13_ITEM1_P1_S2	Since inception in 1966, we have grown through internal expansion and through strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies, intellectual property, manufacturing processes and product offerings.
21510_13_ITEM1_P1_S3	We are organized into two operating segments: Specialty Lasers and Systems ("SLS") and Commercial Lasers and Components ("CLC").
21510_13_ITEM1_P1_S4	This segmentation reflects the go-to-market strategies for various products and markets.
21510_13_ITEM1_P1_S5	While both segments deliver cost-effective photonics solutions, SLS develops and manufactures configurable, advanced performance products largely serving the microelectronics, scientific research and government programs and OEM components and instrumentation markets.
21510_13_ITEM1_P1_S6	The size and complexity of many of the SLS products require service to be performed at the customer site by factory-trained field service engineers.
21510_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	CLC focuses on higher volume products that are offered in set configurations.
21510_13_ITEM1_P2_S1	The product architectures are designed for easy exchange at the point of use such that substantially all product service and repairs are based upon advanced replacement and depot (i.e., factory) repair.
21510_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	CLC's primary markets include materials processing, original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") components and instrumentation and microelectronics.
21510_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	Income (loss) from operations is the measure of profit and loss that our chief operating decision maker ("CODM") uses to assess performance and make decisions.
21510_13_ITEM1_P4_S1	Income (loss) from operations represents the sales less the cost of sales and direct operating expenses incurred within the operating segments as well as allocated expenses such as shared sales and manufacturing costs.
21510_13_ITEM1_P4_S2	We do not allocate to our operating segments certain operating expenses, which we manage separately at the corporate level.
21510_13_ITEM1_P4_S3	These unallocated costs include stock-based compensation and corporate functions (certain advanced research and development, management, finance, legal and human resources) and are included in Corporate and other.
21510_13_ITEM1_P4_S4	Management does not consider unallocated Corporate and other costs in its measurement of segment performance.
21510_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	We were originally incorporated in California on May 26, 1966 and reincorporated in Delaware on October 1, 1990.
21510_13_ITEM1_P5_S1	Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and we are a member of the Standard Poor's SmallCap 600 Index and the Russell 2000 Index.
21510_13_ITEM1_P5_S2	Additional information about Coherent, Inc. (referred to herein as the Company, we, our, or Coherent) is available on our web site at www.coherent.com.
21510_13_ITEM1_P5_S3	We make available, free of charge on our web site, access to our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as soon as reasonably practicable after we file or furnish them electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").
21510_13_ITEM1_P5_S4	Information contained on our web site is not part of this annual report or our other filings with the SEC.
21510_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	Any product, product name, process, or technology described in these materials is the property of Coherent.
21510_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	A laser emits an intense coherent beam of light with some unique and highly useful properties.
21510_13_ITEM1_P7_S1	Most importantly, a laser is orders of magnitude brighter than any lamp.
21510_13_ITEM1_P7_S2	As a result of its coherence, the beam can be focused to a very small and intense spot, useful for applications requiring very high power densities including cutting and other materials processing procedures.
21510_13_ITEM1_P7_S3	The laser's high spatial resolution is also useful for microscopic imaging and inspection applications.
21510_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	Laser light can be monochromatic all the beam energy is confined to a narrow wavelength band.
21510_13_ITEM1_P8_S1	Some lasers can be used to create ultrafast output a series of pulses with pulse durations as short as attoseconds (i.e., 10 -18 seconds).
21510_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	There are many types of lasers and one way of classifying them is by the material or medium used to create the lasing action.
21510_13_ITEM1_P9_S1	This can be in the form of a gas, liquid, semiconductor, solid state crystal or fiber.
21510_13_ITEM1_P9_S2	Lasers can also be classified by their output wavelength: ultraviolet, visible, infrared or wavelength tunable.
21510_13_ITEM1_P9_S3	We manufacture all of these laser types.
21510_13_ITEM1_P9_S4	There are also many options in terms of pulsed output versus continuous wave, pulse duration, output power, beam dimensions, etc.
21510_13_ITEM1_P9_S5	In fact, each application has its specific requirements in terms of laser performance.
21510_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	to offer a diverse set of product lines characterized by lasers targeted at growth opportunities and key applications.
21510_13_ITEM1_P10_S1	In all cases, we aim to be the supplier of choice by offering a high-value combination of superior technical performance and high reliability.
21510_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	Photonics has taken its place alongside electronics as a critical enabling technology for the twenty-first century.
21510_13_ITEM1_P11_S1	Photonics based solutions are entrenched in a broad array of industries that include industrial automation, textile processing, microelectronics, flat panel displays and medical diagnostics, with adoption continuing in ever more diverse applications.
21510_13_ITEM1_P11_S2	Growth in these applications stems from two sources.
21510_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	First, there are many applications where the laser is displacing conventional technology because it can do the job faster, better or more economically.
21510_13_ITEM1_P12_S1	Second, there are new applications where the laser is the enabling tool that makes the work possible (e.g., the production of sub 50 micron microvias); these lasers are used in the manufacturing of high density printed circuit boards ("PCBs") found in the latest smart phones and tablet computers.
21510_13_ITEM1_P12_S2	Key laser applications include: semiconductor inspection; manufacturing of advanced PCBs; flat panel display manufacturing; solar cell production; medical and bio-instrumentation; materials processing; industrial process and quality control; marking; imaging and printing; graphic arts and display; and, research and development.
21510_13_ITEM1_P12_S3	For example, ultraviolet ( UV ) lasers are enabling the move towards miniaturization, which drives innovation and growth in many markets.
21510_13_ITEM1_P12_S4	In addition, the advent of industrial grade ultrafast lasers continues to open up new applications for laser processing.
21510_13_ITEM1_P12_S5	We strive to develop innovative and proprietary products and solutions that meet the needs of our customers and that are based on our core expertise in lasers and optical technologies.
21510_13_ITEM1_P12_S6	In pursuit of our strategy, we intend to:
21510_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	Leverage our technology portfolio and application engineering to lead the proliferation of photonics into broader markets We will continue to identify opportunities in which our technology portfolio and application engineering can be used to offer innovative solutions and gain access to new markets.
21510_13_ITEM1_P13_S1	We plan to utilize our expertise to increase our market share in the mid to high power material processing applications.
21510_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	Optimize our leadership position in existing markets There are a number of markets where we have historically been at the forefront of technological development and product deployment and from which we have derived a substantial portion of our revenues.
21510_13_ITEM1_P14_S1	We plan to optimize our financial returns from these markets.
21510_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	Maintain and develop additional strong collaborative customer and industry relationships We believe that the Coherent brand name and reputation for product quality, technical performance and customer satisfaction will help us to further develop our loyal customer base.
21510_13_ITEM1_P15_S1	We plan to maintain our current customer relationships and develop new ones with customers who are industry leaders and work together with these customers to design and develop innovative product systems and solutions as they develop new technologies.
21510_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	Develop and acquire new technologies and market share We will continue to enhance our market position through our existing technologies and develop new technologies through our internal research and development efforts, as well as through the acquisition of additional complementary technologies, intellectual property, manufacturing processes and product offerings.
21510_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	Streamline our manufacturing structure and improve our cost structure We will focus on optimizing the mix of products that we manufacture internally and externally.
21510_13_ITEM1_P17_S1	We will utilize vertical integration where our internal manufacturing process is considered proprietary and seek to leverage external sources when the capabilities and cost structure are well developed and on a path towards commoditization.
21510_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	Focus on long-term improvement of adjusted EBITDA, in dollars and as a percentage of net sales We define adjusted EBITDA as operating income adjusted for depreciation, amortization, stock compensation expenses, major restructuring costs and certain other non-operating income and expense items.
21510_13_ITEM1_P18_S1	Key initiatives to reach our goals for EBITDA improvements include utilization of our Asian manufacturing locations, rationalizing our supply chain and continued leveraging of our infrastructure.
21510_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	APPLICATIONS Our products address a broad range of applications that we group into the following markets: Microelectronics, Materials Processing, OEM Components and Instrumentation and Scientific Research and Government Programs.
21510_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	Microelectronics Nowhere is the trend towards miniaturization more prevalent than in the Microelectronics market where smart phones, tablets, ultrabooks, personal computers ("PC's") and televisions ("TV's") are driving advances in displays, integrated circuits and PCBs.
21510_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	In response to market demands and expectations, semiconductor and device manufacturers are continually seeking to improve their process and design technologies in order to manufacture smaller, more powerful and more reliable devices at lower cost.
21510_13_ITEM1_P21_S1	New laser applications and new laser technologies are a key element in delivering higher resolution and higher precision at lower manufacturing cost.
21510_13_ITEM1_P21_S2	We support three major markets in the microelectronics industry: (1) flat panel display ("FPDs") manufacturing, (2) advanced packaging and interconnects and (3) semiconductor front-end.
21510_13_ITEM1_P21_S3	Microelectronics flat panel display manufacturing The high-volume consumer market is driving the production of FPDs in applications such as mobile phones, tablets, ultrabooks, laptop computers, and TVs.
21510_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	There are several types of established and emerging displays based on quite different technologies, including liquid crystal ("LCD") and organic polymers ("OLED").
21510_13_ITEM1_P22_S1	Each of these technologies utilize laser applications given that lasers provide higher process speed, better yield, improved battery life, lower cost and/or superior display brightness and resolution.
21510_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	Several display types require a high-density pattern of silicon thin film transistors ("TFTs").
21510_13_ITEM1_P23_S1	If this silicon is polycrystalline, the display performance is greatly enhanced.
21510_13_ITEM1_P23_S2	In the past, these polysilicon layers could only be produced on expensive special glass at high temperatures.
21510_13_ITEM1_P23_S3	However, excimer-based processes, such as excimer laser annealing ("ELA") have allowed high-volume production of low-temperature polysilicon ("LTPS") on conventional glass substrates.
21510_13_ITEM1_P23_S4	Our excimer lasers provide an invaluable solution for LTPS because they are the only industrial-grade excimer lasers with the high pulse energy optimized for this application.
21510_13_ITEM1_P23_S5	The current state-of-the-art product for this application is our excimer VYPER laser, which delivers over 1000W of power, enabling customers to scale to current Generation 5 5.5 substrates all the way up to Generation 8 sizes.
21510_13_ITEM1_P23_S6	These systems are integral to the manufacturing process on all leading LTPS-based smart phone displays, with the highest commercially available pixel densities of greater than 300 pixels per inch (ppi) and hold the potential for deployment in tablet display and OLED TV manufacturing.
21510_13_ITEM1_P23_S7	Our AVIA, Rapid, Talisker and DIAMOND lasers are also used in other production processes for FPDs.
21510_13_ITEM1_P23_S8	These processes include drilling, cutting, patterning, marking and yield improvement.
21510_13_ITEM1_P23_S9	Lasers have also become a valuable tool in high-brightness ("HB") LED manufacturing, improving LED performance and yield.
21510_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	LED has seen rapid growth over the last several years due to widespread adoption as the light source in all categories of LCD displays, from phones all the way to full size TVs.
21510_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	Our lasers are used in the back-end processing of HB-LEDs.
21510_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	Microelectronics advanced packaging and interconnects After a wafer is patterned, there are then a host of other processes, referred to as back-end processing, which finally result in a packaged encapsulated silicon chip.
21510_13_ITEM1_P26_S1	Ultimately, these chips are then assembled into finished products.
21510_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	The advent of high-speed logic and high-memory content devices has caused chip manufacturers to look for alternative technologies to improve performance and lower process costs.
21510_13_ITEM1_P27_S1	In terms of materials, this search includes new types of materials, such as low-k and thinner silicon.
21510_13_ITEM1_P27_S2	Our AVIA, Rapid, Talisker and Matrix lasers provide economical methods of cutting and scribing these wafers while delivering higher yields than traditional mechanical methods.
21510_13_ITEM1_P27_S3	There are similar trends in chip packaging and PCB manufacturing requiring more compact packaging and denser interconnects.
21510_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	In many cases, lasers present enabling technologies.
21510_13_ITEM1_P28_S1	For instance, lasers are now the only economically practical method for drilling microvias in chip substrates and in both rigid and flexible PCBs.
21510_13_ITEM1_P28_S2	These microvias are tiny interconnects that are essential for enabling high-density circuitry commonly used in smart phones, tablets and advanced computing systems.
21510_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	Our DIAMOND carbon dioxide ("CO 2 ") and AVIA diode pumped solid state ("DPSS") lasers are the lasers of choice in this application.
21510_13_ITEM1_P29_S1	The ability of these lasers to operate at very high repetition rates translates into faster drilling speeds and increased throughput in microvia processing applications.
21510_13_ITEM1_P29_S2	In addition, multi-layer circuit boards require more flexible production methods than conventional printing technologies can offer, which has led to widespread adoption of laser direct imaging ("LDI").
21510_13_ITEM1_P29_S3	Our Paladin laser is used for this application.
21510_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	The term "front-end" refers to the production of semiconductor devices which occurs prior to packaging.
21510_13_ITEM1_P30_S1	As semiconductor device geometries decrease in size, devices become increasingly susceptible to smaller defects during each phase of the manufacturing process and these defects can negatively impact yield.
21510_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	One of the semiconductor industry's responses to the increasing vulnerability of semiconductor devices to smaller defects has been to use defect detection and inspection techniques that are closely linked to the manufacturing process.
21510_13_ITEM1_P31_S1	For example, automated laser-based inspection systems are now used to detect and locate defects as small as 0.01 micron, which may not be observable by conventional optical microscopes.
21510_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	Detecting the presence of defects is only the first step in preventing their recurrence.
21510_13_ITEM1_P32_S1	After detection, defects must be examined in order to identify their size, shape and the process step in which the defect occurred.
21510_13_ITEM1_P32_S2	This examination is called defect classification.
21510_13_ITEM1_P32_S3	Identification of the sources of defects in the lengthy and complex semiconductor manufacturing process has become essential for maintaining high yield production.
21510_13_ITEM1_P32_S4	Semiconductor manufacturing has become an around-the-clock operation and it is important for products used for inspection, measurement and testing to be reliable and to have long lifetimes.
21510_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	Our Azure, Paladin and Excimer lasers are used to detect and characterize defects in semiconductor chips.
21510_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	Materials Processing Lasers are widely accepted today in many important industrial manufacturing applications including cutting, welding, joining, drilling, perforating, and marking of metals and nonmetals.
21510_13_ITEM1_P34_S1	We supply high-power lasers for metal processing and low-to-medium power lasers for laser marking, nonmetals processing and precision micromachining.
21510_13_ITEM1_P34_S2	Our high power industrial laser systems are used for cutting, welding, cladding and hardening of metals, as well as other materials processing applications.
21510_13_ITEM1_P34_S3	Our Semiconductor business provides higher power arrays with powers in excess of 50 kilowatts through proprietary cooling and stacking technology.
21510_13_ITEM1_P34_S4	This unique technology provides the engine for both our Highlight direct diode systems as well as our kW class fiber lasers.
21510_13_ITEM1_P34_S5	Our differentiated fiber laser design offers our customers a higher level of integration and additional options for product serviceability.
21510_13_ITEM1_P34_S6	Our fiber lasers are used for metal cutting, cladding and welding applications.
21510_13_ITEM1_P34_S7	Complementing our high power solid state lasers is our industry leading DIAMOND E1000 CO 2 laser.
21510_13_ITEM1_P34_S8	Introduced in 2009, this laser remains in high demand due to its high power, small size and completely sealed design - all ideal for material processing.
21510_13_ITEM1_P34_S9	Combining the high power Direct Diode, Fiber and CO 2 offerings with our MetaBeam 1000 flatbed cutting tool provides a strong, compelling four-pronged approach to meeting the needs of our diverse materials processing customers.
21510_13_ITEM1_P34_S10	The new METABEAM 1000 offers the industry's most compact 1kW tool, with tool footprints at least 50% smaller than competitive designs.
21510_13_ITEM1_P34_S11	Operating costs, due to a combination of input power efficiencies and the sealed nature of the DIAMOND series of CO 2 lasers, are 50% less than similar, but larger tools.
21510_13_ITEM1_P34_S12	We also participate in the low to medium power area, including such applications as the cutting, drilling and joining of a host of materials using our DIAMOND CO 2 lasers; Highlight fiber array product ("FAP") semiconductor lasers in OEM opportunities and direct end user applications with the lower power OMNIBEAM and METABEAM cutting tools; applications including cutting, perforating and scoring of paper, thin metals and packaging materials; and various cutting and patterning applications in the textile, wood and sign industries.
21510_13_ITEM1_P34_S13	In the specific area of textiles and clothing, our DIAMOND lasers service older applications, such as cutting complex shapes in leather for footwear, as well as newer applications such as creating detailed fade patterns on designer denims.
21510_13_ITEM1_P34_S14	Laser marking and coding are generally considered part of the precision materials processing applications market for which we remain a leading supplier.
21510_13_ITEM1_P34_S15	One such area where applications are growing rapidly is the displacement of ink-jet coding due to both aesthetic and environmental pressures.
21510_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	The optimum choice of laser depends on the material being marked, whether it is a surface mark (engraved) or a sub-surface mark, and the specific economics of the application.
21510_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	Our DIAMOND C and GEM Series of CO 2 lasers provide many systems manufacturers with a reliable cost effective source for marking and engraving on non-metals.
21510_13_ITEM1_P36_S1	In addition, our Matrix product line of reliable, compact and low-cost DPSS lasers provides an ideal solution for marking of other materials in high volume manufacturing.

21510_13_ITEM1_P37_S2	We also support the laser-based instrumentation market with a range of laser-related components, including diode lasers for optical pumping.
21510_13_ITEM1_P37_S3	Our OEM component business includes sales to other, less integrated laser manufacturers participating in OEM markets such as materials processing, scientific, and medical.
21510_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	Bio-instrumentation Bio-instrumentation applications for lasers include bio-agent detection for point source and standoff detection of pathogens or other bio-toxins; confocal microscopy for biological imaging that allows researchers and clinicians to visualize cellular and subcellular structures and processes with an incredible amount of detail; DNA sequencing that provides automation and data acquisition rates that would be impossible by any other method; drug discovery genomic and proteomic analyses that enable drug discovery to proceed at very high throughput rates; and flow cytometry for analyzing single cells or populations of cells in a heterogeneous mixture, including blood samples.
21510_13_ITEM1_P38_S1	Our OBIS, Galaxy, Sapphire, Compass and Coherent CUBE lasers are used in several bio-instrumentation applications.
21510_13_ITEM1_P39_S0	Medical Therapy We sell a variety of components and lasers to medical laser companies in end-user applications such as ophthalmology, aesthetic, surgical, therapeutic and dentistry.
21510_13_ITEM1_P39_S1	Our DIAMOND series CO 2 lasers are widely used in ophthalmic, aesthetic and surgical markets.
21510_13_ITEM1_P39_S2	We have a leading position in Lasik and photorefractive keratectomy surgery methods with our ExciStar XS excimer laser platform.
21510_13_ITEM1_P39_S3	With the acquisition of Lumera, we now have ultrafast lasers targeted for use in laser cataract surgery.
21510_13_ITEM1_P39_S4	The unique ability of our optically pumped semiconductor lasers ("OPSL") technology to match a wavelength to an application has led to the development of a high-power yellow (577nm) laser for the treatment of eye related diseases, such as Age Related Macular Degeneration and retinal diseases associated with diabetes.
21510_13_ITEM1_P39_S5	The 577nm wavelength was designed to match the peak in absorption of oxygenated hemoglobin thereby allowing treatment to occur at a lower power level, and thus reducing stress and heat-load placed on the eye with traditional green-based (530nm) solid state lasers.
21510_13_ITEM1_P39_S6	Other applications where our OBIS, Genesis and Sapphire series of lasers are used include the retinal scanning market in diagnostic imaging systems as well as new ground breaking in-vivo imaging.
21510_13_ITEM1_P40_S0	Scientific research and government programs We are widely recognized as a technology innovator and the scientific market has historically provided an ideal "test market" for our leading-edge innovations.
21510_13_ITEM1_P40_S1	These have included ultrafast lasers, DPSS lasers, continuous-wave ("CW") systems, excimer gas lasers and water-cooled ion gas lasers.
21510_13_ITEM1_P40_S2	Our portfolio of lasers that address the scientific research market is broad and includes our Chameleon, COMPexPro, Evolution, Legend, Libra, MBD, MBR, Vitara, Mira and Verdi lasers.
21510_13_ITEM1_P40_S3	Many of the innovations and products pioneered in the scientific marketplace have become commercial successes for both our OEM customers and us.
21510_13_ITEM1_P40_S4	We have a large installed base of scientific lasers which are used in a wide range of applications spanning virtually every branch of science and engineering.
21510_13_ITEM1_P40_S5	These applications include biology and life science, engineering, physical chemistry and physics.
21510_13_ITEM1_P40_S6	Most of these applications require the use of ultrafast lasers that enable the generation of pulses short enough to be measured in femto- or attoseconds (10 -15 to 10 -18 seconds).
21510_13_ITEM1_P40_S7	Because of these very short pulse durations, ultrafast lasers enable the study of fundamental physical and chemical processes with temporal resolution unachievable with any other tool.
21510_13_ITEM1_P40_S8	These lasers also deliver very high peak power and large bandwidths, which can be used to generate many exotic effects.
21510_13_ITEM1_P40_S9	Some of these are now finding their way into mainstream applications, such as microscopy or materials processing.
21510_13_ITEM1_P40_S10	The use of ultrafast lasers such as the Chameleon in microscopy is now a common occurrence in bio-imaging labs.
21510_13_ITEM1_P40_S11	FUTURE TRENDS Microelectronics Lasers are widely used in mass production microelectronics applications largely because they enable entirely new application capabilities that cannot be realized by any other known means.
21510_13_ITEM1_P40_S12	These laser-based fabrication and testing methods provide a level of precision, typically on a micrometer and nanometer level, that are unique, faster, are touch free, deliver superior end products, increase yields, and/or cut production costs.
21510_13_ITEM1_P40_S13	We anticipate this trend to continue, driven primarily by the increasing sophistication of consumer electronic goods and their convergence via the internet, resulting in increasing demand for better displays, more bandwidth and memory, and all packaged into devices which are lighter, thinner and consume less power.
21510_13_ITEM1_P40_S14	Although this market follows the macro-economic trends and carries inherent risks, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to capitalize on the current market trends and that we will see continued increased adoption of our solid-state, CO 2 , pulsed fiber, direct diode and excimer lasers, as all these lasers enable entirely new applications, performance improvements and reduced process costs.
21510_13_ITEM1_P41_S0	LTPS-based high resolution mobile displays (greater than 300ppi), and especially the emergence of OLED technology, is evolving as the prevalent FPD technology.
21510_13_ITEM1_P41_S1	We believe we are well positioned, especially with our Vyper Excimer lasers and LB optical systems, to take advantage of this trend, including the possibility of LTPS-based OLED TVs and flexible OLED displays.
21510_13_ITEM1_P42_S0	CO 2 , Avia, Rapid, Talisker, Helios and direct diode lasers all seem aligned with the need for related FPD touch panel, film cutting, light guide technology, repair, frit welding and glass cutting applications.
21510_13_ITEM1_P43_S0	The trend for thinner and lighter devices is impacting the glass substrates used in today s mobile devices requiring thinner glass with higher degrees of mechanical strength and scratch resistance.
21510_13_ITEM1_P43_S1	Mechanical means of cutting these glass panels are no longer adequate to meet future requirements and we expect lasers to play an increased role.
21510_13_ITEM1_P43_S2	Our CO 2 and Rapid lasers are well positioned to take advantage of this trend.
21510_13_ITEM1_P43_S3	Semiconductor devices look set to continue Moore's Law, shrinking device geometries for at least another decade, as well as expanding vertically into new 3D structures.
21510_13_ITEM1_P43_S4	As a result we believe our many UV laser sources (such as Azure, Paladin, Avia, Talisker, ExiStar and Matrix) will continue to find increasing adoption, since their unique optical properties align well with the process demands of a nanometer scale world.
21510_13_ITEM1_P43_S5	The same lasers plus CO 2 are also widely adopted for back end Advanced Packaging and Interconnect (API) applications.
21510_13_ITEM1_P43_S6	With dimension roadmaps showing a decade of dimension shrink on PCBs, interconnects, Silicon LED scribe widths and glass thickness, we believe that our portfolio of lasers aligns well with these demands as well as new processes that seem likely to be enabled by our lasers, to meet the increasing demands and decreasing tolerances of these markets.
21510_13_ITEM1_P43_S7	Materials processing The market for low to medium power CO 2 , solid state and semiconductor lasers used in industrial materials processing has experienced a nice rebound and is expected to see continued growth driven by wider adoption of lasers in new processes especially in emerging markets.

21510_13_ITEM1_P46_S1	We have developed an expanded portfolio of lasers with a broad spectrum of wavelengths, enabling optimum solutions for virtually every metal and non-metal material type.
21510_13_ITEM1_P46_S2	At the same time, the reliability of these products has been achieved at even higher levels, lowering the cost of ownership.
21510_13_ITEM1_P47_S0	The instrumentation market is seeing a gradual migration from the use of mature laser technologies, such as water-cooled ion gas lasers, to new technologies, primarily based on solid state and semiconductor lasers.
21510_13_ITEM1_P47_S1	Using our unique portfolio of such lasers, as well as our patented OPSL technology, we are able to both assist and stimulate this transition as well as to be the technology of choice for developing applications such as security and clinical diagnostics.
21510_13_ITEM1_P47_S2	Our OPSL technology resulted in the first truly continuous wave solid-state UV laser which enables the use of UV in a clinical as well as a research environment.
21510_13_ITEM1_P47_S3	Furthermore we anticipate greater future opportunities in bio-instrumentation, including DNA sequencing, drug discovery, flow cytometry, and microscopy, based on our product enhancements and evolving market developments, particularly in increased migration from clinical to point-of-care diagnostics.
21510_13_ITEM1_P48_S0	Our newer laser technologies are the basis of a number of clinical procedures.
21510_13_ITEM1_P48_S1	In the area of photocoagulation, our Genesis OPSL yellow lasers are being used as the wavelength is particularly suitable for the treatment of blood vessels.
21510_13_ITEM1_P48_S2	In aesthetic laser procedures, we are an OEM supplier of CO 2 and semiconductor lasers to the major manufacturers of equipment used in the latest procedures in dermatology and hair removal.
21510_13_ITEM1_P48_S3	We supply excimer lasers used in refractive eye surgery and are actively involved in further developments in laser vision correction including use of ultrafast lasers in applications such as laser cataract surgery where higher precision and use of advanced implants enable better and more reliable patient outcomes.
21510_13_ITEM1_P48_S4	Laser cataract surgery is a relatively new application which is expected to see strong growth over the next several years.
21510_13_ITEM1_P48_S5	The scientific market benefited from stimulus funding during fiscal 2011, with applications in ultrashort pulses and in bio-research being the drivers of this anticipated expansion.

21510_13_ITEM1_P76_S17	We refurbish excimer tubes at our manufacturing site in South Korea.
21510_13_ITEM1_P77_S0	INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights.
21510_13_ITEM1_P77_S1	As of September 28, 2013 , we held approximately 429 U.S. and foreign patents, which expire from 2014 through 2030 (depending on the payment of maintenance fees) and we have approximately 156 additional pending patent applications that have been filed.
21510_13_ITEM1_P77_S2	The issued patents cover various products in all of the major markets that we serve.
21510_13_ITEM1_P78_S0	For a discussion of the importance to our business of, and the risks attendant to intellectual property rights, see "Risk Factors" in Item 1A "We may not be able to protect our proprietary technology which could adversely affect our competitive advantage" and "We may, in the future, be subject to claims or litigation from third parties, for claims of infringement of their proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of competitors or other rights holders.
21510_13_ITEM1_P78_S1	These claims could result in costly litigation and the diversion of our technical and management personnel.
21510_13_ITEM1_P79_S0	COMPETITION Competition in the various photonics markets in which we provide products is very intense.
21510_13_ITEM1_P79_S1	We compete against a number of companies including CVI Melles Griot, GSI Group, Inc., IPG Photonics Corporation, JDS Uniphase Corporation, Newport Corporation, Rofin-Sinar Technologies, Inc., and Trumpf GmbH, as well as other smaller companies.
21510_13_ITEM1_P79_S2	We compete globally based on our broad product offering, reliability, cost, and performance advantages for the widest range of commercial and scientific research applications.
21510_13_ITEM1_P79_S3	Other considerations by our customers include warranty, global service and support and distribution.
21510_13_ITEM1_P79_S4	At fiscal 2013 year-end, our backlog of orders scheduled for shipment (within one year) was $285.8 million compared to $352.8 million at fiscal 2012 and $356.5 million at fiscal 2011 year-end.
21510_13_ITEM1_P79_S5	By segment, backlog for SLS was $204.7 million, $272.1 million and $265.9 million, respectively, at fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 year-ends.
21510_13_ITEM1_P79_S6	Backlog for CLC was $81.1 million, $80.7 million and $90.6 million, respectively, at fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 year-ends.
21510_13_ITEM1_P79_S7	The decrease in SLS backlog from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013 year-end is primarily due to timing of large excimer laser annealing orders for the flat panel display market.
21510_13_ITEM1_P79_S8	Orders used to compute backlog are generally cancelable without substantial penalties.
21510_13_ITEM1_P80_S0	Historically, the rate of cancellation experienced by us has not been significant though we cannot guarantee that cancellations will not increase in the future.
21510_13_ITEM1_P80_S1	We have historically experienced decreased bookings and revenue in the first fiscal quarter compared to other quarters in our fiscal year due to the impact of time off and business closures at many of our customers due to year-end holidays.
21510_13_ITEM1_P80_S2	This historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's future net sales or financial performance.
21510_13_ITEM1_P81_S0	As of fiscal 2013 year-end, we had 2,514 employees.
21510_13_ITEM1_P81_S1	Approximately 391 of our employees are involved in research and development; 1,530 of our employees are involved in operations, manufacturing, service and quality assurance; and 593 of our employees are involved in sales, order administration, marketing, finance, information technology and other administrative functions.
21510_13_ITEM1_P82_S0	Our success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain employees.
21510_13_ITEM1_P82_S1	We face competition in this regard from other companies, research and academic institutions, government entities and other organizations.
21510_13_ITEM1_P82_S2	We consider our relations with our employees to be good.

21510_13_ITEM1_P87_S2	Business Combinations" of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of this annual report for further discussion of the acquisition completed during fiscal 2013 .
21510_13_ITEM1_P87_S3	There were no new restructuring activities undertaken during fiscal 2013 or fiscal 2012.
21510_13_ITEM1_P88_S0	During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we acquired the assets and certain liabilities of StockerYale's laser module product line in Montreal, Canada and began to transition those activities to contract manufacturers and other Coherent facilities in Salem, Massachusetts, Wilsonville, Oregon and Sunnyvale, California.
21510_13_ITEM1_P88_S1	The transfer was completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2011.
21510_13_ITEM1_P89_S0	During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we announced our plans to close our facilities in Tampere, Finland and St. Louis, Missouri.
21510_13_ITEM1_P89_S1	The closure of our St. Louis, Missouri and Yokohama, Japan sites were completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.
21510_13_ITEM1_P89_S2	The closure of our Finland site was scheduled for completion by the end of fiscal 2010, but we decided to delay the closure due to increased demand for products manufactured in Finland.
21510_13_ITEM1_P89_S3	In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we ceased manufacturing operations in our Finland facility and we exited the facility in the third quarter of fiscal 2011.
21510_13_ITEM1_P90_S0	Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection regulations relating to the use, storage, handling and disposal of regulated materials, chemicals, various radioactive materials and certain waste products.
21510_13_ITEM1_P91_S0	In the United States, we are subject to the federal regulation and control of the Environmental Protection Agency.
21510_13_ITEM1_P91_S1	Comparable authorities are involved in other countries.
21510_13_ITEM1_P91_S2	Such rules are subject to change by the governing agency and we monitor those changes closely.
21510_13_ITEM1_P91_S3	We expect all operations to meet the legal and regulatory environmental requirements and believe that compliance with those regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive and financial position.
21510_13_ITEM1_P91_S4	Although we believe that our safety procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of such materials comply with the standards required by federal and state laws and regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials.
21510_13_ITEM1_P91_S5	In the event of such an accident involving such materials, we could be liable for damages and such lia bility could exceed the amount of our liability insurance coverage and the resources of our business.
21510_13_ITEM1_P92_S0	We may face potentially increasing complexity in our product designs and procurement operations due to the evolving nature of product compliance standards.
21510_13_ITEM1_P92_S1	Those standards may impact the material composition of our products entering specific markets.
21510_13_ITEM1_P92_S2	Such regulations went into effect in the European Union ("EU") in 2006, and China in 2007.
21510_13_ITEM1_P93_S0	We could face significant costs and liabilities in connection with product take-back legislation.
21510_13_ITEM1_P94_S0	Beginning in 2006, the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive made producers of electrical goods financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products.
21510_13_ITEM1_P94_S1	In addition, the EU has added the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals Regulation, otherwise known as the REACH Regulation, which further regulates substances and products imported, manufactured or sold within the EU.
21510_13_ITEM1_P94_S2	Similar laws are now pending in various jurisdictions around the world, including the United States.
21510_13_ITEM1_P95_S0	Our operations are subject to various laws and regulations governing the environment, including the discharge of pollutants and the management and disposal of hazardous substances.
21510_13_ITEM1_P95_S1	As a result of our historic as well as on-going operations, we could incur substantial costs, including remediation costs.
21510_13_ITEM1_P95_S2	The costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to predict.
21510_13_ITEM1_P95_S3	Our accruals for such costs and liabilities may not be adequate because the estimates on which the accruals are based depend on a number of factors including the nature of the matter, the complexity of the site, site geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) at multi-party sites and the number and financial viability of other PRPs.
21510_13_ITEM1_P96_S0	SEGMENT INFORMATION We are organized into two operating segments: Specialty Lasers and Systems ("SLS") and Commercial Lasers and Components ("CLC").
21510_13_ITEM1_P96_S1	This segmentation reflects the go-to-market strategies for various products and markets.
21510_13_ITEM1_P97_S0	SLS develops and manufacturers configurable, advanced-performance products largely serving the microelectronics, scientific research and government programs and OEM components and instrumentation markets.
21510_13_ITEM1_P97_S1	The size and complexity of many of the SLS products require service to be performed at the customer site by factory-trained field service engineers.
21510_13_ITEM1_P97_S2	While both segments work to deliver cost-effective photonics solutions, CLC focuses on higher volume products that are offered in set configurations.
21510_13_ITEM1_P97_S3	The product architectures are designed for easy exchange at the point of use such that product service and repairs are based upon advanced replacement and depot (i.e., factory) repair.
21510_13_ITEM1_P98_S0	CLC's primary markets include materials processing, OEM components and instrumentation and microelectronics.
21510_13_ITEM1_P99_S0	We have identified SLS and CLC as operating segments for which discrete financial information was available.
21510_13_ITEM1_P99_S1	Both units have dedicated engineering, manufacturing, product business management and product line management functions.
21510_13_ITEM1_P100_S0	A small portion of our outside revenue is attributable to projects and recently developed products for which a segment has not yet been determined.
21510_13_ITEM1_P101_S0	The associated direct and indirect costs are presented in the category of Corporate and other, along with other corporate costs.
21510_13_ITEM1_P102_S0	FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND EXPORT SALES Financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations for fiscal years 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , is set forth in Note 18, "Segment and Geographic Information" of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of this annual report.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	You should carefully consider the followings risks when considering an investment in our Common Stock.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These risks could materially affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, cause the trading price of our Common Stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P0_S2	These risks are not exclusive, and additional risks to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, the factors mentioned under Forward-Looking Statements and the risk of our businesses described elsewhere in this annual report.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Additionally, these risks and uncertainties described herein are not the only ones facing us.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our operating results, including net sales, net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA in dollars and as a percentage of net sales, as well as our stock price have varied in the past, and our future operating results will continue to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations based upon numerous factors, including those discussed in this Item 1A and throughout this report.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our stock price will continue to be subject to daily variations as well.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Our future operating results and stock price may not follow any past trends or meet our guidance and expectations.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our net sales and operating results, such as adjusted EBITDA percentage, net income (loss) and operating expenses, and our stock price have varied in the past and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year in the future.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We believe a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, could cause these variations and make them difficult to predict, including:
21510_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	distraction of management related to acquisition or divestment activities.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In addition, we often recognize a substantial portion of our sales in the last month of our fiscal quarters.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	impact of the shortfall on our operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We also base our manufacturing on our forecasted product mix for the quarter.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If the actual product mix varies significantly from our forecast, we may not be able to fill some orders during that quarter, which would result in delays in the shipment of our products.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Accordingly, variations in timing of sales, particularly for our higher priced, higher margin products, can cause significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Due to these and other factors, such as varying product mix, we believe that quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year comparisons of our historical operating results may not be meaningful.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	You should not rely on our results for any quarter or year as an indication of our future performance.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Our operating results in future quarters and years may be below public market analysts' or investors' expectations, which would likely cause the price of our stock to fall.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P6_S3	In addition, over the past several years, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the stock prices of many technology companies both in and outside our industry.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P6_S4	There has not always been a direct correlation between this volatility and the performance of particular companies subject to these stock price fluctuations.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Further, over the last twelve months, equity markets around the world have significantly fluctuated across most sectors.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P6_S6	These factors, as well as general economic and political conditions or investors' concerns regarding the credibility of corporate financial statements, may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our stock in the future.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We are exposed to risks associated with worldwide economic conditions and related uncertainties which could negatively impact demand for our products and results of operations.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets, depressed consumer confidence, government economic policies, negative economic conditions, volatile corporate profits and reduced capital spending could negatively impact demand for our products.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	In particular, it is difficult to develop and implement strategy, sustainable business models and efficient operations, as well as effectively manage supply chain relationships in the face of such conditions including uncertainty regarding the ability of some of our suppliers to continue operations and provide us with uninterrupted supply flow.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Our ability to maintain our research and development investments in our broad product offerings may be adversely impacted in the event that our sales decline and do not increase in the future.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Spending and the timing thereof by consumers and businesses have a significant impact on our results and, where such spending is delayed or canceled, it could have a material negative impact on our operating results.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The current global economic conditions remain uncertain and challenging.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Weakness in our end markets could negatively impact our net sales, gross margin and operating expenses, and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Continued uncertainty in U.S. and global fiscal policy has likely had a recent adverse impact on global financial markets and overall economic activity.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Should this uncertain financial policy continue, it would likely negatively impact global economic activity, including possibly sending the U.S. into a new recession.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	It would also likely have negative repercussions on U.S. and global credit and financial markets, and further exacerbate sovereign debt concerns in the European Union.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P10_S3	All of these factors would likely adversely impact the global demand for our products and the performance of our investments, and would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The financial turmoil which recently affected the banking system and financial markets continues to negatively impact financial institutions and has resulted in tighter credit markets, and lower levels of liquidity in some financial markets.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	There could be a number of follow-on effects from the tightened credit environment on our business, including the insolvency of key suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and/or manufacture products resulting in product delays; inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and/or customer insolvencies; and failure of financial institutions negatively impacting our treasury functions.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P11_S2	In the event our customers are unable to obtain credit or otherwise pay for our shipped products it could significantly impact our ability to collect on our outstanding accounts receivable.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments; impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments; interest rates; cash balances; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Volatility in the financial markets and any overall economic uncertainty increase the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Uncertainty about current global economic conditions could also continue to increase the volatility of our stock price.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	In addition, political and social turmoil related to international conflicts, terrorist acts and civil unrest may put further pressure on economic conditions in the United States and abroad.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Unstable economic, political and social conditions make it difficult for our customers, our suppliers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P12_S2	If such conditions persist, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Additionally, unstable economic conditions can provide significant pressures and burdens on individuals, which could cause them to engage in inappropriate business conduct.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P12_S4	See Part II, Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We depend on sole source or limited source suppliers, both internal and external, for some of our key components and materials, including exotic materials, certain cutting-edge optics and crystals, in our products, which make us susceptible to supply shortages or price fluctuations that could adversely affect our business.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We currently purchase several key components and materials used in the manufacture of our products from sole source or limited source suppliers, both internal and external.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Our failure to timely receive these key components and materials, such as the large optics used in our flat panel display manufacturing applications, could cause delays in the shipment of our products.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Some of these suppliers are relatively small private companies that may discontinue their operations at any time and which may be particularly susceptible to prevailing economic conditions.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Some of our suppliers are located in regions which may be susceptible to natural disasters, such as the flooding in Thailand and the earthquake, tsunami and resulting nuclear disaster in Japan in recent years and last year's severe flooding and power loss in the Eastern part of the United States.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P14_S4	We typically purchase our components and materials through purchase orders or agreed upon terms and conditions and we do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with many of these suppliers.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Some of our products, particularly in the flat panel display industry, require designs and specifications which are at the cutting-edge of available technologies.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Our and our customers' designs and specifications frequently change to meet rapidly evolving market demands.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P14_S7	Accordingly certain of our products require components and supplies which may be technologically difficult and unpredictable to manufacture.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P14_S8	These characteristics further pressure the timely delivery of such components.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P14_S9	We may fail to obtain these supplies in a timely manner in the future.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P14_S10	We may experience difficulty identifying alternative sources of supply for certain components used in our products and may have to incur expenses and management distraction in assisting our current and future suppliers to meet our and our customers' technical requirements.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P14_S11	We would experience further delays while identifying, evaluating and testing the products of these potential alternative suppliers.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P14_S12	Furthermore, financial or other difficulties faced by these suppliers or significant changes in demand for these components or materials could limit their availability.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P14_S13	We continue to consolidate our supply base and move supplier locations.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P14_S14	When we transition locations we may increase our inventory of such products as a safety stock during the transition, which may cause the amount of inventory reflected on our balance sheet to increase.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P14_S15	Additionally, many of our customers rely on sole source suppliers.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P14_S16	In the event of a disruption of our customers' supply chain, orders from our customers could decrease or be delayed.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these components or materials, or the inability to obtain these components and materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time, or our failure to properly manage these moves, would impair our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and could cause customers to cancel orders.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We have historically relied exclusively on our own production capability to manufacture certain strategic components, crystals, semiconductor lasers, lasers and laser-based systems.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Because we manufacture, package and test these components, products and systems at our own facilities, and such components, products and systems are not readily available from other sources, any interruption in manufacturing would adversely affect our business.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P16_S2	In addition, our failure to achieve adequate manufacturing yields of these items at our manufacturing facilities may materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We participate in the microelectronics market, which requires significant research and development expenses to develop and maintain products and a failure to achieve market acceptance for our products could have a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The microelectronics market is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product introductions, the volatility of product supply and demand, changing customer requirements and evolving industry standards.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The nature of this market requires significant research and development expenses to participate, with substantial resources invested in advance of material sales of our products to our customers in this market.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Additionally, our product offerings may become obsolete given the frequent introduction of alternative technologies.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P18_S3	In the event either our customers' or our products fail to gain market acceptance, or the microelectronics market fails to grow, it would likely have a significant negative effect on our business and results of operations.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We participate in the flat panel display market, which has a relatively limited number of end customer manufacturers.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Our backlog, timing of net sales and results of operations could be negatively impacted in the event our customers reschedule orders.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	In the flat panel display market, there are a relatively limited number of manufacturers who are the end customers for our annealing products.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Given macroeconomic conditions, varying consumer demand and technical process limitations at manufacturers, our customers may seek to reschedule or cancel orders.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Challenges in meeting evolving technological requirements for these complex products by us and our suppliers could also result in delays in shipments, rescheduled or canceled orders by our customers.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P20_S3	This could negatively impact our backlog, timing of net sales and results of operations.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Additionally, as our backlog includes higher average selling price flat panel display systems, any delays or cancellation of shipments could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Some of our laser systems are complex in design and may contain defects that are not detected until deployed by our customers, which could increase our costs and reduce our net sales.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Lasers and laser systems are inherently complex in design and require ongoing regular maintenance.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The manufacture of our lasers, laser products and systems involves a highly complex and precise process.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P23_S2	As a result of the technological complexity of our products, in particular the flat panel annealing systems, changes in our or our suppliers' manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective materials by us or our suppliers could result in a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and product reliability.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P23_S3	To the extent that we do not achieve and maintain our projected yields or product reliability, our business, operating results, financial condition and customer relationships would be adversely affected.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P23_S4	We provide warranties on a majority of our product sales, and reserves for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P23_S5	The determination of such reserves requires us to make estimates of failure rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P23_S6	We typically establish warranty reserves based on historical warranty costs for each product line.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P23_S7	If actual return rates and/or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates, adjustments to cost of sales may be required in future periods which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated under the end user's peak stress conditions.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P24_S1	In addition, some of our products are combined with products from other vendors, which may contain defects.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P24_S2	As a result, should problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P24_S3	If we are unable to identify and fix defects or other problems, we could experience, among other things:
21510_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	legal actions by our customers and/or their end users.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Continued volatility in the semiconductor manufacturing industry could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	A portion of our net sales in the microelectronics market depend on the demand for our products by semiconductor equipment companies.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The semiconductor market has historically been characterized by sudden and severe cyclical variations in product supply and demand, which have often severely affected the demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment, including laser-based tools and systems.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The timing, severity and duration of these market cycles are difficult to predict, and we may not be able to respond effectively to these cycles.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P29_S2	The continuing uncertainty in this market severely limits our ability to predict our business prospects or financial results in this market.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	During industry downturns, our net sales from this market may decline suddenly and significantly.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Our ability to rapidly and effectively reduce our cost structure in response to such downturns is limited by the fixed nature of many of our expenses in the near term and by our need to continue our investment in next-generation product technology and to support and service our products.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P30_S2	In addition, due to the relatively long manufacturing lead times for some of the systems and subsystems we sell to this market, we may incur expenditures or purchase raw materials or components for products we cannot sell.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Accordingly, downturns in the semiconductor capital equipment market may materially harm our operating results.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Conversely, when upturns in this market occur, we must be able to rapidly and effectively increase our manufacturing capacity to meet increases in customer demand that may be extremely rapid, and if we fail to do so we may lose business to our competitors and our relationships with our customers may be harmed.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are managed through various banks around the world and volatility in the capital and credit market conditions could cause financial institutions to fail or materially harm service levels provided by such banks, both of which could have an adverse affect on our ability to timely access funds.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	World capital and credit markets have been and may continue to experience volatility and disruption.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P32_S1	In some cases, the markets have exerted downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers, as well as pressured the solvency of some financial institutions.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P32_S2	These financial institutions, including banks, have had difficulty timely performing regular services and in some cases have failed or otherwise been largely taken over by governments.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We maintain our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments with a number of financial institutions around the world.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Should some or all of these financial institutions fail or otherwise be unable to timely perform requested services, we would likely have a limited ability to timely access our cash deposited with such institutions, or, in extreme circumstances the failure of such institutions could cause us to be unable to access cash for the foreseeable future.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P33_S2	If we are unable to quickly access our funds when we need them, we may need to increase the use of our existing credit lines or access more expensive credit, if available.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P33_S3	If we are unable to access our cash or if we access existing or additional credit or are unable to access additional credit, it could have a negative impact on our operations, including our reported net income.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We are exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Although we have not recognized any material losses on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, future declines in their market values could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Given the global nature of our business, we have investments both domestically and internationally.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	There has recently been growing pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, particularly in Europe where a significant portion of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are invested, which results in corresponding pressure on the valuation of the securities issued by such nations.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Additionally, our overall investment portfolio is often concentrated in certificates of deposit and money market funds.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P37_S2	We maintain a mix of government-issued securities.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P37_S3	Credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, financial results, or other factors.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P37_S4	Additionally, liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations could result in decreased values for our investments in certain government securities.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P37_S5	As a result, the value or liquidity of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments could decline or become materially impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P37_S6	See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to increase our sales volumes and decrease our costs to offset potential declines in the average selling prices ( ASPs ) of our products and, if we are unable to realize greater sales volumes and lower costs, our operating results may suffer.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our ability to increase our sales volume and our future success depends on the continued growth of the markets for lasers, laser systems and related accessories, as well as our ability to identify, in advance, emerging markets for laser-based systems.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P39_S1	We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify, on a timely basis, new high-growth markets in the future.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Moreover, we cannot assure you that new markets will develop for our products or our customers' products, or that our technology or pricing will enable such markets to develop.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Future demand for our products is uncertain and will depend to a great degree on continued technological development and the introduction of new or enhanced products.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P39_S4	If this does not continue, sales of our products may decline and our business will be harmed.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We have in the past experienced decreases in the ASPs of some of our products.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P40_S1	As competing products become more widely available, the ASPs of our products may decrease.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P40_S2	If we are unable to offset any decrease in our ASPs by increasing our sales volumes, our net sales will decline.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P40_S3	In addition, to maintain our gross margins, we must continue to reduce the cost of manufacturing our products while maintaining their high quality.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	From time to time, our products, like many complex technological products, may fail in greater frequency than anticipated.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P41_S1	This can lead to further charges, which can result in higher costs, lower gross margins and lower operating results.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Furthermore, as ASPs of our current products decline, we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements with higher margins.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P41_S3	If we cannot maintain our gross margins, our operating results could be seriously harmed, particularly if the ASPs of our products decrease significantly.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new and enhanced products that meet the needs of our customers.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our current products address a broad range of commercial and scientific research applications in the photonics markets.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We cannot assure you that the market for these applications will continue to generate significant or consistent demand for our products.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Furthermore, the new and enhanced products in certain markets generally continue to be smaller in size and have lower ASPs, and therefore, we have to sell more units to maintain revenue levels.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Accordingly, we must continue to invest in research and development in order to develop competitive products.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to anticipate our customers' needs and develop products that address those needs.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Introduction of new products and product enhancements will require that we effectively transfer production processes from research and development to manufacturing and coordinate our efforts with those of our suppliers to achieve volume production rapidly.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P45_S2	If we fail to transfer production processes effectively, develop product enhancements or introduce new products in sufficient quantities to meet the needs of our customers as scheduled, our net sales may be reduced and our business may be harmed.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We face risks associated with our foreign operations and sales that could harm our financial condition and results of operations.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P47_S0	For fiscal 2013 , fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 , 77% , 76% and 74% , respectively, of our net sales were derived from customers outside of the United States.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P47_S1	We anticipate that foreign sales, particularly in Asia, will continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales in the foreseeable future.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P48_S0	A global economic slowdown or a natural disaster could have a negative effect on various foreign markets in which we operate, such as the earthquake, tsunami and resulting nuclear disaster during fiscal 2011 in Japan and last year's flooding in Thailand.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Such a slowdown may cause us to reduce our presence in certain countries, which may negatively affect the overall level of business in such countries.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Our foreign sales are primarily through our direct sales force.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Additionally, some foreign sales are made through foreign distributors and resellers.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Our foreign operations and sales are subject to a number of risks, including:
21510_13_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our business could also be impacted by international conflicts, terrorist and military activity, civil unrest and pandemic illness which could cause a slowdown in customer orders or cause customer order cancellations.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We are also subject to the risks of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, which could materially adversely affect the sales price of our products in foreign markets, as well as the costs and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P51_S1	While we use forward exchange contracts and other risk management techniques to hedge our foreign currency exposure, we remain exposed to the economic risks of foreign currency fluctuations.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We may not be able to protect our proprietary technology which could adversely affect our competitive advantage.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Maintenance of intellectual property rights and the protection thereof is important to our business.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P53_S1	We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P53_S2	We cannot assure you that our patent applications will be approved, that any patents that may be issued will protect our intellectual property or that any issued patents will not be challenged by third parties.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P53_S3	Other parties may independently develop similar or competing technology or design around any patents that may be issued to us.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P53_S4	We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P53_S5	Further, we may be required to enforce our intellectual property or other proprietary rights through litigation, which, regardless of success, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management's attention.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P53_S6	Additionally, there may be existing patents of which we are unaware that could be pertinent to our business and it is not possible for us to know whether there are patent applications pending that our products might infringe upon since these applications are often not publicly available until a patent is issued or published.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We may, in the future, be subject to claims or litigation from third parties, for claims of infringement of their proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of competitors or other rights holders.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P54_S1	These claims could result in costly litigation and the diversion of our technical and management personnel.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Adverse resolution of litigation may harm our operating results or financial condition.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P55_S0	In recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States involving patents and other intellectual property rights.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P55_S1	This has been seen in our industry, for example in the recently concluded patent-related litigation between IMRA America, Inc. ("Imra") and IPG Photonics Corporation and in Imra's recently brought litigation against two of our German subsidiaries.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P56_S0	From time to time, like many other technology companies, we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights, copyrights, trademark rights or other intellectual property rights which such third parties believe may cover certain of our products, processes, technologies or information.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P56_S1	In the future, we may be a party to litigation to protect our intellectual property or as a result of an alleged infringement of others' intellectual property whether through direct claims or by way of indemnification claims of our customers, as, in some cases, we contractually agree to indemnify our customers against third-party infringement claims relating to our products.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P56_S2	These claims and any resulting lawsuit, if successful, could subject us to significant liability for damages or invalidation of our proprietary rights.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P56_S3	These lawsuits, regardless of their success, would likely be time-consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P56_S4	Any potential intellectual property litigation could also force us to do one or more of the following:
21510_13_ITEM1A_P57_S0	redesign the products that use the technology.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P58_S0	If we are forced to take any of these actions or are otherwise a party to lawsuits of this nature, we may incur significant losses for which we do not have insurance and our business may be seriously harmed.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P58_S1	We do not have insurance to cover potential claims of this type.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P59_S0	If our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Factors that may be considered in determining whether a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable include declines in our stock price and market capitalization or future cash flows projections.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P60_S3	We recorded a charge during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 related to the impairment of intangibles in our SLS operating segment relating to the decision to discontinue the legacy Hypertronics products.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P60_S4	A decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in market conditions, particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we used to calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units, could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an impairment charge.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P60_S5	Any such material charges, whether related to goodwill or purchased intangible assets, may have a material negative impact on our financial and operating results.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We depend on skilled personnel to operate our business effectively in a rapidly changing market, and if we are unable to retain existing or hire additional personnel when needed, our ability to develop and sell our products could be harmed.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel will be a critical factor in determining whether we will be successful in the future.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Recruiting and retaining highly skilled personnel in certain functions continues to be difficult.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P63_S1	At certain locations where we operate, the cost of living is extremely high and it may be difficult to retain key employees and management at a reasonable cost.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P63_S2	We may not be successful in attracting, assimilating or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P63_S3	Our failure to attract additional employees and retain our existing employees could adversely affect our growth and our business.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and support personnel, any of whom may leave, which could harm our business and our results of operations.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P65_S0	The long sales cycles for our products may cause us to incur significant expenses without offsetting net sales.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Customers often view the purchase of our products as a significant and strategic decision.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P66_S1	As a result, customers typically expend significant effort in evaluating, testing and qualifying our products before making a decision to purchase them, resulting in a lengthy initial sales cycle.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P66_S2	While our customers are evaluating our products and before they place an order with us, we may incur substantial sales and marketing and research and development expenses to customize our products to the customers' needs.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P66_S3	We may also expend significant management efforts, increase manufacturing capacity and order long lead-time components or materials prior to receiving an order.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P66_S4	Even after this evaluation process, a potential customer may not purchase our products.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P66_S5	As a result, these long sales cycles may cause us to incur significant expenses without ever receiving net sales to offset such expenses.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P67_S0	The markets in which we sell our products are intensely competitive and increased competition could cause reduced sales levels, reduced gross margins or the loss of market share.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Competition in the various photonics markets in which we provide products is very intense.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P68_S1	We compete against a number of large public and private companies, including CVI Melles Griot, GSI Group, Inc., IPG Photonics Corporation, JDS Uniphase Corporation, Newport Corporation, Rofin-Sinar Technologies, Inc., and Trumpf GmbH, as well as other smaller companies.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P68_S2	Some of our competitors are large companies that have significant financial, technical, marketing and other resources.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P68_S3	These competitors may be able to devote greater resources than we can to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P68_S4	Some of our competitors are much better positioned than we are to acquire other companies in order to gain new technologies or products that may displace our product lines.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P68_S5	Any of these acquisitions could give our competitors a strategic advantage.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P68_S6	Any business combinations or mergers among our competitors, forming larger companies with greater resources, could result in increased competition, price reductions, reduced margins or loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Additional competitors may enter the markets in which we serve, both foreign and domestic, and we are likely to compete with new companies in the future.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P69_S1	We may encounter potential customers that, due to existing relationships with our competitors, are committed to the products offered by these competitors.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P69_S2	Further, our current or potential customers may determine to develop and produce products for their own use which are competitive to our products.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P69_S3	As a result of the foregoing factors, we expect that competitive pressures may result in price reductions, reduced margins, loss of sales and loss of market share.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P69_S4	In addition, in markets where there are a limited number of customers, competition is particularly intense.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P70_S0	If we fail to accurately forecast component and material requirements for our products, we could incur additional costs and incur significant delays in shipments, which could result in a loss of customers.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P71_S0	We use rolling forecasts based on anticipated product orders and material requirements planning systems to determine our product requirements.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P71_S1	It is very important that we accurately predict both the demand for our products and the lead times required to obtain the necessary components and materials.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P71_S2	We depend on our suppliers for most of our product components and materials.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P71_S3	Lead times for components and materials that we order vary significantly and depend on factors including the specific supplier requirements, the size of the order, contract terms and current market demand for components.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P71_S4	For substantial increases in our sales levels of certain products, some of our suppliers may need at least nine months lead-time.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P71_S5	If we overestimate our component and material requirements, we may have excess inventory, which would increase our costs.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P71_S6	If we underestimate our component and material requirements, we may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt and delay delivery of our products to our customers.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P71_S7	Any of these occurrences would negatively impact our net sales, business or operating results.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Our increased reliance on contract manufacturing and other outsourcing may adversely impact our financial results and operations due to our decreased control over the performance and timing of certain aspects of our manufacturing.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Our manufacturing strategy includes partnering with contract manufacturers to outsource non-core subassemblies and less complex turnkey products, including some performed at international sites located in Asia and Eastern Europe.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Additionally, we have outsourced the manufacture of certain of our optics components to certain third parties.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P73_S2	Our ability to resume internal manufacturing operations for certain products and components in a timely manner may be eliminated.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P73_S3	The cost, quality, performance and availability of contract manufacturing operations are and will be essential to the successful production and sale of many of our products.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P73_S4	Our financial condition or results of operation could be adversely impacted if any contract manufacturer or other supplier is unable for any reason, including as a result of the impact of worldwide economic conditions, to meet our cost, quality, performance, and availability standards.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P73_S5	We may not be able to provide contract manufacturers with product volumes that are high enough to achieve sufficient cost savings.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P73_S6	If shipments fall below forecasted levels, we may incur increased costs or be required to take ownership of the inventory.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P73_S7	Also, our ability to control the quality of products produced by contract manufacturers may be limited and quality issues may not be resolved in a timely manner, which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P74_S0	If we fail to effectively manage our growth or, alternatively, our spending during downturns, our business could be disrupted, which could harm our operating results.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Growth in sales, combined with the challenges of managing geographically dispersed operations, can place a significant strain on our management systems and resources, and our anticipated growth in future operations could continue to place such a strain.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P75_S1	The failure to effectively manage our growth could disrupt our business and harm our operating results.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P75_S2	Our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in evolving markets requires an effective planning and management process.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P75_S3	In economic downturns, we must effectively manage our spending and operations to ensure our competitive position during the downturn, as well as our future opportunities when the economy improves, remain intact.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P75_S4	The failure to effectively manage our spending and operations could disrupt our business and harm our operating results.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Historically, acquisitions have been an important element of our strategy.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P76_S1	However, we may not find suitable acquisition candidates in the future and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P76_S2	Any acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P77_S0	We have in the past made strategic acquisitions of other corporations and entities, as well as asset purchases, and we continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions of complementary companies, products and technologies.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P77_S1	In the event of any future acquisitions, we could:
21510_13_ITEM1A_P78_S0	incur expenses related to impairment of goodwill and amortization.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Acquisitions also involve numerous risks, including:
21510_13_ITEM1A_P80_S0	the failure to complete acquisitions even after signing definitive agreements which, among other things, would result in the expensing of potentially significant professional fees and other charges in the period in which the acquisition or negotiations are terminated.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P81_S0	We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify appropriate acquisition candidates, to integrate any businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future or achieve the anticipated benefits of such transactions, which may harm our business.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P82_S0	We are exposed to lawsuits in the normal course of business which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P83_S0	We are exposed to lawsuits in the normal course of our business, including product liability claims, if personal injury, death or commercial losses occur from the use of our products.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P83_S1	While we typically maintain business insurance, including directors' and officers' policies, litigation can be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations, including the potential impact of indemnification obligations for individuals named in any such lawsuits.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P83_S2	We may not, however, be able to secure insurance coverage on terms acceptable to us in the future.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P83_S3	Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P83_S4	An unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit, including a recall or redesign of products if ultimately determined to be defective, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P84_S0	We use standard laboratory and manufacturing materials that could be considered hazardous and we could be liable for any damage or liability resulting from accidental environmental contamination or injury.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Although most of our products do not incorporate hazardous or toxic materials and chemicals, some of the gases used in our excimer lasers and some of the liquid dyes used in some of our scientific laser products are highly toxic.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P85_S1	In addition, our operations involve the use of standard laboratory and manufacturing materials that could be considered hazardous.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P85_S2	Also, if a facility fire were to occur at our Sunnyvale, California site and were to spread to a reactor used to grow semiconductor wafers, it could release highly toxic emissions.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P85_S3	We believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with all federal, state and offshore regulations and standards.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P85_S4	However, the risk of accidental environmental contamination or injury from such materials cannot be entirely eliminated.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P85_S5	In the event of such an accident involving such materials, we could be liable for damages and such liability could exceed the amount of our liability insurance coverage and the resources of our business which could have an adverse effect on our financial results or our business as a whole.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Compliance or the failure to comply with current and future environmental regulations could cause us significant expense.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P87_S0	We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process or requiring design changes or recycling of products we manufacture.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P87_S1	If we fail to comply with any present and future regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities, the suspension of production or a prohibition on the sale of products we manufacture.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P87_S2	In addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment, or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations, including expenses associated with the recall of any non-compliant product and the management of historical waste.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P88_S0	From time to time new regulations are enacted, and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P88_S1	We continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P88_S2	These regulations include, for example, the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical substances ( REACH ), the Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive ( RoHS ) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive ( WEEE ) enacted in the European Union which regulate the use of certain hazardous substances in, and require the collection, reuse and recycling of waste from, certain products we manufacture.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P88_S3	This and similar legislation that has been or is in the process of being enacted in Japan, China, Korea and various states of the United States may require us to re-design our products to ensure compliance with the applicable standards, for example by requiring the use of different types of materials.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P89_S0	We believe we comply with all such legislation where our products are sold and we will continue to monitor these laws and the regulations being adopted under them to determine our responsibilities.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P89_S1	In addition, we are monitoring legislation relating to the reduction of carbon emissions from industrial operations to determine whether we may be required to incur any additional material costs or expenses associated with our operations.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P89_S2	We are not currently aware of any such material costs or expenses.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P90_S0	The SEC has promulgated rules requiring disclosure regarding the use of certain conflict minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and procedures regarding a manufacturer's efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P90_S1	The implementation of such rules has required us to incur additional expense and internal resources and may continue to do so in the future, particularly in the event that only a limited pool of suppliers are available to certify that products are free from conflict minerals.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P90_S2	Our failure to comply with any of the foregoing regulatory requirements or contractual obligations could result in our being directly or indirectly liable for costs, fines or penalties and third-party claims, and could jeopardize our ability to conduct business in the United States and foreign countries.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P91_S0	Our and our customers' operations would be seriously harmed if our logistics or facilities or those of our suppliers, our customers' suppliers or our contract manufacturers were to experience catastrophic loss.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Our and our customers' operations, logistics and facilities and those of our suppliers and contract manufacturers could be subject to a catastrophic loss from fire, flood, earthquake, volcanic eruption, work stoppages, power outages, acts of war, pandemic illnesses, energy shortages, theft of assets, other natural disasters or terrorist activity.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P93_S0	A substantial portion of our research and development activities, manufacturing, our corporate headquarters and other critical business operations are located near major earthquake faults in Santa Clara, California, an area with a history of seismic events.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P93_S1	Any such loss or detrimental impact to any of our operations, logistics or facilities could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and net sales and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P93_S2	While we have obtained insurance to cover most potential losses, after reviewing the costs and limitations associated with earthquake insurance, we have decided not to procure such insurance.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P93_S3	We believe that this decision is consistent with decisions reached by numerous other companies located nearby.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P93_S4	We cannot assure you that our existing insurance coverage will be adequate against all other possible losses.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P93_S5	Difficulties with our enterprise resource planning ( ERP ) system and other parts of our global information technology system could harm our business and results of operation.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P93_S6	If our network security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer's data or our data or our information technology systems, we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Like many modern multinational corporations, we maintain a global information technology system, including software products licensed from third parties.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P94_S1	Any system, network or Internet failures, misuse by system users, the hacking into or disruption caused by the unauthorized access by third parties or loss of license rights could disrupt our ability to timely and accurately manufacture and ship products or to report our financial information in compliance with the timelines mandated by the SEC.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P94_S2	Any such failure, misuse, hacking, disruptions or loss would likely cause a diversion of management's attention from the underlying business and could harm our operations.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P94_S3	In addition, a significant failure of our global information technology system could adversely affect our ability to complete an evaluation of our internal controls and attestation activities pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P95_S0	As part of our day-to-day business, we store our data and certain data about our customers in our global information technology system.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P95_S1	While our system is designed with access security, if a third party gains unauthorized access to our data, including any regarding our customers, such a security breach could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, loss of business, litigation and possible liability.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P95_S2	These security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P95_S3	Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers' data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P95_S4	Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P95_S5	Any security breach could result in a loss of confidence by our customers, damage our reputation, disrupt our business, lead to legal liability and negatively impact our future sales.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Changes in tax rates, tax liabilities or tax accounting rules could affect future results.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P97_S0	As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries and jurisdictions.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P97_S1	Significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P97_S2	Our future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries or states with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in the tax laws.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P97_S3	In addition, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) and other tax authorities.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P98_S0	make substantive changes to tax rules and the application of rules to companies, including various announcements from the United States government potentially impacting our ability to defer taxes on international earnings.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P98_S1	We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P98_S2	Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Federal securities laws, rules and regulations, as well as the rules and regulations of self-regulatory organizations such as NASDAQ and the NYSE, require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures, impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements, set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers, chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P100_S1	These laws, rules and regulations have increased and will continue to increase the scope, complexity and cost of our corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices, which could harm our results of operations and divert management's attention from business operations.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P101_S1	New or changed laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P101_S2	As a result, their application in practice may evolve over time.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P102_S0	We are committed to maintaining high standards of ethics, corporate governance and public disclosure.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P102_S1	Complying with evolving interpretations of new or changed legal requirements may cause us to incur higher costs as we revise current practices, policies and procedures, and may divert management time and attention from revenue generating to compliance activities.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P102_S2	If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, our reputation may also be harmed.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P103_S0	Governmental regulations, including duties, affecting the import or export of products could negatively affect our net sales.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P104_S0	The United States and many foreign governments impose tariffs and duties on the import and export of products, including some of those which we sell.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P104_S1	In particular, given our worldwide operations, we pay duties on certain products when they are imported into the United States for repair work as well as on certain of our products which are manufactured by our foreign subsidiaries.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P104_S2	These products can be subject to a duty on the product value.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P104_S3	Additionally, the United States and various foreign governments have imposed tariffs, controls, export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies, especially encryption technology.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P104_S4	From time to time, government agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology, such as requiring the escrow and governmental recovery of private encryption keys.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P104_S5	Governmental regulation of encryption technology and regulation of imports or exports, or our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products, could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our net sales.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P104_S6	From time to time our duty calculations and payments are audited by government agencies.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P105_S0	In addition, compliance with the directives of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls ( DDTC ) may result in substantial expenses and diversion of management.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P105_S1	Any failure to adequately address the directives of DDTC could result in civil fines or suspension or loss of our export privileges, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P106_S0	Our market is unpredictable and characterized by rapid technological changes and evolving standards demanding a significant investment in research and development, and, if we fail to address changing market conditions, our business and operating results will be harmed.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P107_S0	The photonics industry is characterized by extensive research and development, rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P107_S1	Because this industry is subject to rapid change, it is difficult to predict its potential size or future growth rate.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P107_S2	Our success in generating net sales in this industry will depend on, among other things:
21510_13_ITEM1A_P108_S0	our ability to accurately predict and develop our products to meet industry standards.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P109_S0	For our fiscal years 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , our research and development costs were $82.8 million ( 10.2% of net sales), $78.3 million ( 10.2% of net sales) and $81.2 million ( 10.1% of net sales), respectively.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P109_S1	We cannot assure you that our expenditures for research and development will result in the introduction of new products or, if such products are introduced, that those products will achieve sufficient market acceptance or to generate sales to offset the costs of development.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P109_S2	Our failure to address rapid technological changes in our markets could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P110_S0	Failure to maintain effective internal controls may cause a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements or to cause us to delay filing our periodic reports with the SEC and adversely affect our stock price.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P111_S0	The SEC, as directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on Form 10-K that contain an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P111_S1	In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P111_S2	Although we test our internal control over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with the Section 404 requirements, our failure to maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements or a delay in our ability to timely file our periodic reports with the SEC, which ultimately could negatively impact our stock price.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P112_S0	Provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law, and our Change-of-Control Severance Plan may have anti-takeover effects that could prevent or delay a change in control.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P113_S0	Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition or make removal of incumbent directors or officers more difficult.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P113_S1	These provisions may discourage takeover attempts and bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P114_S0	establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P115_S0	We are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a merger, asset or stock sale or other transaction with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date such person became an interested stockholder, unless prior approval of our board of directors is obtained or as otherwise provided.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P115_S1	These provisions of Delaware law also may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us without obtaining the prior approval of our board of directors, which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P116_S0	In addition, we have adopted a change of control severance plan, which provides for the payment of a cash severance benefit to each eligible employee based on the employee's position.
21510_13_ITEM1A_P116_S1	If a change of control occurs, our successor or acquirer will be required to assume and agree to perform all of our obligations under the change of control severance plan which may discourage potential acquirers or result in a lower stock price.
21510_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	_________________________________________ (1) This facility is utilized primarily by our CLC operating segment.
21510_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	(2) This facility is utilized primarily by our SLS operating segment.
21510_13_ITEM2_P0_S2	We maintain other sales and service offices under varying leases expiring from 2014 through 2020 in the United States, Japan, South Korea, China, Taiwan, Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.
21510_13_ITEM2_P0_S3	We consider our facilities to be both suitable and adequate to provide for current and near term req uirements and that the productive capacity in our facilities is substantially being utilized or we have plans to utilize it.
21510_13_ITEM2_P0_S4	We plan to renew leases on buildings as they expire.
21510_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are subject to legal claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, such as product liability, employment or intellectual property claims, including, but not limited to, the matters described below.
21510_13_ITEM3_P1_S0	On May 14, 2013, Imra America ( Imra ) filed a complaint for patent infringement against two of the Company s subsidiaries in the Regional Court of D sseldorf, Germany, captioned In re IMRA America Inc. versus Coherent Kaiserslautern GmbH et.
21510_13_ITEM3_P1_S1	The complaint alleges that the use of certain of the Company s lasers infringes upon EP Patent No. 754,103, entitled Method For Controlling Configuration of Laser Induced Breakdown and Ablation, issued November 5, 1997.
21510_13_ITEM3_P1_S2	The patent is owned by the University of Michigan and licensed to Imra.
21510_13_ITEM3_P1_S3	The complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages, the cost of court proceedings and seeks to permanently enjoin the Company from infringing the patent in the future.
21510_13_ITEM3_P1_S4	With respect to this matter, management has determined that a potential loss is not probable and accordingly, no amount has been accrued.
21510_13_ITEM3_P1_S5	Management has determined a potential loss is reasonably possible as it is defined by ASC 450; however, based on its current knowledge, management does not believe that the amount of such possible loss or a range of potential loss is reasonably estimable.
21510_13_ITEM3_P1_S6	Although we do not expect that such legal claims and litigation will ultimately have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, an adverse result in one or more matters could negatively affect our results in the period in which they occur.
21510_13_ITEM3_P2_S0	Income Tax Audits We are subject to taxation and file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions.
21510_13_ITEM3_P2_S1	For U.S. federal income tax purposes, all years prior to 2010 are closed.
21510_13_ITEM3_P2_S2	In our major foreign jurisdictions and our major state jurisdictions, the years prior to 2006 and 2009, respectively, are closed to examination.
21510_13_ITEM3_P2_S3	Earlier years in our various jurisdictions may remain open for adjustment to the extent that we have tax attribute carryforwards from those years.
21510_13_ITEM3_P2_S4	In December 2011 and January 2012, three of our German subsidiaries received notices of tax audits for the fiscal years 2006 through 2010.
21510_13_ITEM3_P2_S5	We received a preliminary assessment for two of the German subsidiaries and the amount is immaterial; the audit for the other German subsidiary is currently in process.
21510_13_ITEM3_P2_S6	In addition, our German subsidiary of Coherent Kaiserslautern GmbH (formerly Lumera Laser GmbH) that was acquired in December 2012 is currently under audit for the fiscal years 2007 through 2009.
21510_13_ITEM3_P2_S7	As the years under the audit for Coherent Kaiserslautern GmbH are related to the pre-acquisition periods, the tax assessment should be recoverable from the escrow account for the acquisition.
21510_13_ITEM3_P2_S8	Management believes that it has adequately provided for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.
21510_13_ITEM3_P3_S0	We regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions.
21510_13_ITEM3_P3_S1	It is reasonably possible that certain federal, foreign and state tax matters may be concluded in the next 12 months.
21510_13_ITEM3_P3_S2	Although the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that the balance of net unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties could be reduced by approximately $0.3 million to $2.4 million in the next 12 months.
21510_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	The number of stockholders of record as of November 22, 2013 was 875 .
21510_13_ITEM5_P0_S1	On December 10, 2012, we announced that the Board of Directors approved a $1.00 per share special cash dividend on our outstanding common stock payable on December 27, 2012 to stockholders of record on December 19, 2012, resulting in a payment of $24.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.
21510_13_ITEM5_P0_S2	While we paid a cash dividend in fiscal 2013 and may elect to pay dividends in the future, we have no present intention to declare cash dividends.
21510_13_ITEM5_P0_S3	Our line of credit agreement requires bank pre-approval for the payment of cash dividends.
21510_13_ITEM5_P0_S4	There were no sales of unregistered securities in fiscal 2013 .
21510_13_ITEM5_P1_S0	There were no stock repurchases during the three months ended September 28, 2013 .
21510_13_ITEM5_P1_S1	Our most recent repurchase authorization expired in October 2013.
21510_13_ITEM5_P2_S0	The following graph shows a five-year comparison of cumulative total stockholder return, calculated on a dividend reinvestment basis and based on a $100 investment, from September 27, 2008 through September 28, 2013 comparing the return on our common stock with the Russell 2000 Index, the Standard and Poors Technology Index and the Nasdaq Composite Index.
21510_13_ITEM5_P2_S1	No dividends have been declared or paid on our common stock during such period.

21510_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS Below is a summary of some of the quantitative performance indicators (as defined below) that are evaluated by management to assess our financial performance.
21510_13_ITEM7_P0_S1	Some of the indicators are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered as an alternative to any other measure for determining operating performance that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
21510_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	Definitions and analysis of these performance indicators are as follows: Bookings and Book-to-Bill Ratio Bookings represent orders received during the current period for products and services to be provided pursuant to service contracts.
21510_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	While we generally have not experienced a significant rate of cancellation, bookings are generally cancelable by our customers without substantial penalty and, therefore, we cannot assure all bookings will be converted to net sales.
21510_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	The book-to-bill ratio is calculated as annual bookings divided by annual net sales.
21510_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	This is an indication of the strength of our business but can sometimes be impacted by a single large order.
21510_13_ITEM7_P2_S2	A ratio greater than 1.0 indicates that demand for our products is greater than what we supply in the year whereas a ratio of less than 1.0 indicates that demand for our products is less than what we supply in the year.
21510_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Fiscal 2013 bookings decreased slightly from bookings in fiscal 2012 and our book-to-bill ratio decreased from 1.01 in fiscal 2012 to 0.95 in fiscal 2013.
21510_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	Bookings decreased 0.8% from fiscal 2012 , with decreases in the microelectronics ( 10% ) and scientific ( 4% ) markets partially offset by increases in the materials processing ( 18% ) and OEM components and instrumentation ( 13% ) markets.
21510_13_ITEM7_P3_S2	Compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2013, decreases in bookings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 in the materials processing market were partially offset by increases in the OEM components and instrumentation, microelectronics and scientific markets.
21510_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	Fiscal 2012 bookings decreased from record bookings in fiscal 2011.
21510_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	Although we maintained a positive book-to-bill of 1.01, the book-to-bill ratio declined to 0.90 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.
21510_13_ITEM7_P4_S2	Bookings decreased 13.6% from fiscal 2011, with decreases in all markets.
21510_13_ITEM7_P4_S3	Bookings decreases by market compared to fiscal 2011 were microelectronics (16%), OEM components and instrumentation (14%), scientific (13%) and materials processing (2%).
21510_13_ITEM7_P4_S4	Although fiscal 2012 bookings decreased in all markets, decreases in bookings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 in the microelectronics market due to timing of large orders were partially offset by increases in the OEM components and instrumentation, scientific and materials processing markets.
21510_13_ITEM7_P4_S5	Although fiscal 2013 bookings decreased 10% from bookings in fiscal 2012 and the book-to-bill ratio for the year was 0.85 , bookings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 increased 10% from the third quarter of fiscal 2013 primarily due to timing of large excimer laser annealing orders for the flat panel display market and strength in the semiconductor capital equipment market.
21510_13_ITEM7_P4_S6	Flat panel display orders for fiscal 2013 decreased 24% from orders in fiscal 2012, but fourth quarter fiscal 2013 orders continued to be strong primarily due to timing of large excimer laser annealing orders.
21510_13_ITEM7_P4_S7	The flat panel display market remains very dynamic with high utilization rates for low-temperature polycrystalline silicon ("LTPS") backplanes.
21510_13_ITEM7_P4_S8	The trend for new product launches in the smartphone market for full HD screens that place more process restrictions on the manufacturing equipment benefits service revenues.
21510_13_ITEM7_P4_S9	Another important development is the release of the first smartphones to incorporate flexible displays.
21510_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	Although flexible displays will eventually cannibalize glass displays, their robustness and shapes should drive an increase in demand across various applications.
21510_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	In the television market, there are some interesting developments including the potential of the adoption of LTPS-equipped organic light-emitting diode ("OLED") screens, but these devices are expensive.
21510_13_ITEM7_P5_S2	Due to their clarity and more manageable price, Ultra HD televisions ("4k") are gaining traction, leading to a resurgence in two laser-based manufacturing steps for light guide panels.
21510_13_ITEM7_P5_S3	We expect to see incremental business during 2014 from these processes.
21510_13_ITEM7_P5_S4	Activity around glass cutting is also very high with most of the development work focused on edge strength of the processed glass, which is key to broad adoption.
21510_13_ITEM7_P5_S5	In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we received the first tranche of the next round of orders for excimer laser annealing equipment for Gen 5.5 systems; the total order was for more than $15 million and we expect to complete delivery within fiscal 2014.
21510_13_ITEM7_P5_S6	We are actively engaged on a second tranche that we expect to receive in fiscal 2014.
21510_13_ITEM7_P5_S7	In addition, our integrator partners have a robust forecast for customers across Asia.
21510_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	Advanced packaging ("API") orders increased significantly for the full fiscal year signaling an overall recovery in the segment, but decreased from orders in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 due to the seasonal capital expenditure slowdown despite high utilization among board manufacturers.
21510_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	The fourth quarter decrease was primarily the result of a reduced response to new smartphones as well as the sale of Hitachi Via Mechanics, a leading supplier of printed circuit board manufacturing equipment, as customers may wait to see what changes, if any, occur as result of the sale before increasing order quantities.
21510_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	Products and technologies from Innolight and Lumera will play important roles in our product offerings for advanced packaging applications.
21510_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	Orders from semiconductor capital equipment OEMs decreased 11% for the full fiscal 2013, but were strong in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 due to new inspection and metrology tool introductions from leading customers.
21510_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	We are working with customers on next generation devices that will support nodes at 20nm and below.
21510_13_ITEM7_P8_S2	Industry analysts are forecasting rising utilization rates, which boosts capacity expansion and service revenues, due to increasing demand for advanced components for smartphones, tablets, set-top boxes and automotive electronics.
21510_13_ITEM7_P8_S3	Growth in these devices offset the continued deterioration of the personal computer market.
21510_13_ITEM7_P8_S4	Demand should also be bolstered by shifts within the internet download manager ("IDM") universe.
21510_13_ITEM7_P8_S5	The combination of these factors has led industry reports to project strong growth in equipment spending in fiscal 2014.
21510_13_ITEM7_P8_S6	OEM Components and Instrumentation Bookings in fiscal 2013 increased 13% from fiscal 2012 and the book-to-bill ratio for the year was 1.04 .
21510_13_ITEM7_P8_S7	Additionally, orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 increased significantly from those in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 led by strength in the medical OEM and instrumentation markets.
21510_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	Medical OEM orders increased significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 with a number of the orders from existing customers in the aesthetic and ophthalmic markets.
21510_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	We found that consumer confidence has been generally good during fiscal 2013, notwithstanding the recent U.S. budget delays and government shutdown.
21510_13_ITEM7_P9_S2	Our business in medical consumables, primarily single-use fibers for benign prostatic hyperplasia ("BPH") and kidney stone treatment, is doing well and we received an initial order for a new dental device that is effective for both hard and soft tissue treatment.
21510_13_ITEM7_P9_S3	We have also broadened our market opportunities through our recent acquisition as Lumera gives us immediate entry into the fast evolving cataract market, where we have been working on design wins and received orders for cataract treatment.
21510_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	generation laser for flap cutting in LASIK, which has the potential to displace much more complex and costly competitive offerings.
21510_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	Demand for instrumentation lasers was very strong during both the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 and the full fiscal year, which is significant given the effects of sequestration on the research side of the instrumentation market.
21510_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	We continue to capture design wins for the OBIS platform, especially in flow cytometry, and we also enjoyed success in the subsystems market for bioinstrumentation.
21510_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	A subsystem or laser engine combines lasers with beam delivery technology to provide a plug-and-play solution.
21510_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	The ease of integration and performance flexibility has increased customer interest in subsystems.
21510_13_ITEM7_P12_S2	Part of the strength comes from new products including OBIS and Galaxy that have broadened our market participation while our legacy products such as Sapphire remain a cornerstone in the cytometry market.
21510_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	Materials Processing Annual bookings increased 18% from fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2013 's book-to-bill ratio was 1.05 .
21510_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	However, bookings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 decreased significantly from the third quarter of fiscal 2013 following a record-setting performance in the prior quarter and reduced bookings in China due to timing of orders for marking and non-metal cutting applications.
21510_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	In general, demand for CO 2 lasers for marking, packaging and engraving has been strong.
21510_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	Our recent introduction of the Diamond E-250, a new embodiment of CO 2 technology, has created new opportunities.
21510_13_ITEM7_P14_S2	We have made steady progress in additive manufacturing with the Highlight direct diode system and we are optimistic about the longer term potential of additive manufacturing; we will be releasing a series of new solutions to address this market.
21510_13_ITEM7_P14_S3	Although fiber laser orders are still at an early stage for us, they contributed to our fiscal 2013 bookings increase.
21510_13_ITEM7_P14_S4	In the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we also shipped a three kilowatt prototype to a leading system integrator for metal cutting.
21510_13_ITEM7_P14_S5	The system delivers the required cutting speed and quality in a package considerably smaller than fiber lasers of comparable output power, thereby saving space on the production floor.
21510_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	In an OEM configuration, we believe our laser may fit inside the customer's tool.
21510_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	Although fiscal 2013 orders decreased 4% from bookings in fiscal 2012 , the book-to-bill ratio for the year was 1.05 .
21510_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	Orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 increased significantly from the third quarter of fiscal 2013 as the U.S. market shrugged off some of the sequestration effects and displayed typical seasonal strength in our fourth quarter.
21510_13_ITEM7_P16_S2	Ultrafast imaging using our Chameleon platform was the largest application for the quarter and fiscal year.
21510_13_ITEM7_P16_S3	Orders for large systems used in chemistry and physics have reverted to pre-stimulus levels with many researchers once again bundling funding to purchase these high-performance systems.
21510_13_ITEM7_P16_S4	However, short- and long-term funding remains uncertain given the budget discussions in Congress.
21510_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	Orders from Europe were in-line with our expectations and exhibited similar application trends to the U.S.
21510_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	There are a few developments to watch in the European market which could contribute to increased booking activity in fiscal 2014 and beyond.
21510_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	The Extreme Lightsource Project is a pan-European effort to develop high-intensity lasers similar to the National Ignition Facility at the Livermore National Lab.
21510_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	In addition, Horizon 2020 is a 7-year, 70 billion program to drive innovation and global competitiveness.
21510_13_ITEM7_P19_S2	Embedded within the Horizon program are two flagship projects to study the human brain and grapheme, a potential successor to silicon in microelectronics, which should impact the photonics industry.
21510_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	In Asia excluding Japan, we continue to see strong demand which contributed to record scientific orders in that region for fiscal 2013.
21510_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	The Pacific Rim market was more balanced between the physical sciences and biological imaging.
21510_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	Bookings in Japan were slower than expected due to delays in the release of stimulus funding.
21510_13_ITEM7_P21_S2	Once the stimulus reaches end users, we expect to see funding skewed towards biological imaging since stem cell research is one of the key targets in the package.
21510_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	Net Sales Net sales include sales of lasers, laser tools, related accessories and service contracts.
21510_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	Net sales for fiscal 2013 increased 5.3% from fiscal 2012 .
21510_13_ITEM7_P22_S2	Net sales for fiscal 2012 decreased 4.2% from fiscal 2011.
21510_13_ITEM7_P22_S3	For a description of the reasons for changes in net sales refer to the "Results of Operations" section below.
21510_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	Gross Profit as a Percentage of Net Sales Gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit percentage") is calculated as gross profit for the period divided by net sales for the period.
21510_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	Gross profit percentage for SLS decreased to 41.7% in fiscal 2013 from 43.2% in fiscal 2012 and from 45.4% in fiscal 2011 .
21510_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	For a description of the reasons for changes in gross profit refer to the "Results of Operations" section below.
21510_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	Research and Development as a Percentage of Net Sales Research and development as a percentage of net sales ("R D percentage") is calculated as research and development expense for the period divided by net sales for the period.
21510_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	Management considers R D percentage to be an important indicator in managing our business as investing in new technologies is a key to future growth.
21510_13_ITEM7_P25_S2	R D percentage was flat at 10.2% from fiscal 2012 and increased from 10.1% in fiscal 2011 .
21510_13_ITEM7_P25_S3	For a description of the reasons for changes in R D spending refer to the "Results of Operations" section below.
21510_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows primarily represents the excess of cash collected from billings to our customers and other receipts over cash paid to our vendors for expenses and inventory purchases to run our business.
21510_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	We believe that cash flows from operations are an important performance indicator because cash generation over the long term is essential to maintaining a healthy business and providing funds to help fuel growth.
21510_13_ITEM7_P26_S2	For a description of the reasons for changes in Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities refer to the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section below.
21510_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	Days Sales Outstanding in Receivables We calculate days sales outstanding ("DSO") in receivables as net receivables at the end of the period divided by net sales during the period and then multiplied by the number of days in the period, using 360 days for years.
21510_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	DSO in receivables indicates how well we are managing our collection of receivables, with lower DSO in receivables resulting in higher working capital availability.
21510_13_ITEM7_P27_S2	The more money we have tied up in receivables, the less money we have available for research and development, acquisitions, expansion, marketing and other activities to grow our business.
21510_13_ITEM7_P27_S3	Our DSO in receivables for fiscal 2013 decreased 6.8 days from fiscal 2012 to 60.8 days.
21510_13_ITEM7_P27_S4	The decrease in DSO in receivables is primarily due to a lower concentration of sales in the last month of the fiscal year, particularly in Asia and Japan, a lower concentration of sales with longer payment terms in Japan and improved collections in Korea, Japan and Europe.
21510_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	Annualized Fourth Quarter Inventory Turns We calculate annualized fourth quarter inventory turns as cost of sales during the fourth quarter annualized and divided by net inventories at the end of the fourth quarter.
21510_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	This indicates how well we are managing our inventory levels, with higher inventory turns resulting in more working capital availability and a higher return on our investments in inventory.
21510_13_ITEM7_P28_S2	The more money we have tied up in inventory, the less money we have available for research and development, acquisitions, expansion, marketing and other activities to grow our business.
21510_13_ITEM7_P28_S3	Our annualized inventory turns for fiscal 2013 increased to 3.0 turns from 2.8 turns in fiscal 2012 .
21510_13_ITEM7_P28_S4	The improvement in inventory turns is primarily due to the impact of increased sales volumes in relation to inventory levels in certain businesses.
21510_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	Capital Spending as a Percentage of Net Sales Capital spending as a percentage of net sales ("capital spending percentage") is calculated as capital expenditures for the period divided by net sales for the period.
21510_13_ITEM7_P29_S1	Capital spending percentage indicates the extent to which we are expanding or improving our operations, including investments in technology and equipment.
21510_13_ITEM7_P29_S2	Management monitors capital spending levels as this assists management in measuring our cash flows, net of capital expenditures.
21510_13_ITEM7_P29_S3	Our capital spending percentage decreased to 2.7% in fiscal 2013 from 4.7% in fiscal 2012 and 4.6% in fiscal 2011 .
21510_13_ITEM7_P29_S4	The fiscal 2013 decrease was primarily due to investments made in fiscal 2012 for manufacturing and refurbishment capacity in Germany and Korea.
21510_13_ITEM7_P29_S5	The fiscal 2012 increase was primarily due to building improvements and purchases of production-related assets to support our expansion in Asia (South Korea and Singapore) and Germany.
21510_13_ITEM7_P29_S6	We expect capital spending for fiscal 2014 to be approximately 4.0% to 4.5% of net sales.
21510_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	We define adjusted EBITDA as operating income adjusted for depreciation, amortization, stock compensation expenses, major restructuring costs and certain other non-operating income and expense items.
21510_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	Key initiatives to reach our goals for EBITDA improvements include utilization of our Asian manufacturing locations, rationalizing our supply chain and continued leveraging of our infrastructure.
21510_13_ITEM7_P30_S2	We utilize a number of different financial measures, both GAAP and non-GAAP, such as adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales, in analyzing and assessing our overall business performance, for making operating decisions and for forecasting and planning future periods.
21510_13_ITEM7_P30_S3	We consider the use of non-GAAP financial measures helpful in assessing our current financial performance and ongoing operations.
21510_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	understanding of certain aspects of our financial performance, we do not consider these measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial measures.
21510_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	We provide adjusted EBITDA in order to enhance investors' understanding of our ongoing operations.
21510_13_ITEM7_P31_S2	This measure is used by some investors when assessing our performance.
21510_13_ITEM7_P31_S3	Below is the reconciliation of our net income as a percentage of net sales to our adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales:
21510_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	SIGNIFICANT EVENTS Restructuring Activities During fiscal 2008, we initiated restructuring plans to decrease costs by consolidating facilities and reducing our workforce.
21510_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	As of September 29, 2012, we had made payments in connection with the restructuring plans in the amount of $27.7 million; we made no payments during fiscal 2013.
21510_13_ITEM7_P32_S2	We completed payments for substantially all anticipated costs related to the restructuring plans in the third quarter of fiscal 2011.
21510_13_ITEM7_P32_S3	In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we ceased manufacturing operations in our Finland facility and recognized a $6.1 million gain, primarily in other income (expense), due to a non-recurring translation adjustment related to the dissolution of our Finland operations.
21510_13_ITEM7_P32_S4	On December 20, 2012, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Lumera for approximately $51.5 million, excluding transaction costs.

21510_13_ITEM7_P51_S6	The decrease was due primarily to lower payroll spending ($4.9 million) due to lower performance-related compensation net of increased headcount partially offset by higher project and other spending ($1.9 million).
21510_13_ITEM7_P51_S7	As a percentage of sales, the slight increase was primarily due to decreased sales volumes.
21510_13_ITEM7_P51_S8	On a segment basis, CLC spending decreased $2.2 million primarily due to lower payroll spending partially offset by higher project spending.
21510_13_ITEM7_P51_S9	SLS spending increased $0.1 million primarily due to higher project and other spending partially offset by lower payroll spending and the impact of foreign exchange rates.
21510_13_ITEM7_P51_S10	Corporate and other spending decreased $0.8 million.
21510_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	Fiscal 2013 selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses increased $11.0 million , or 8% , from fiscal 2012 .
21510_13_ITEM7_P52_S1	The increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Lumera and Innolight in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 ($4.0 million), $3.3 million higher payroll spending due to higher headcount and increased salaries, higher performance-related compensation spending and higher sales commissions, $2.7 million higher other variable spending on consulting and legal costs, sales representative commissions, tradeshows and other as well as $1.9 million higher stock-related compensation expense partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates ($0.9 million).
21510_13_ITEM7_P52_S2	On a segment basis, SLS segment expenses increased $5.6 million primarily due to the acquisitions of Lumera and Innolight, higher payroll spending and higher other variable spending partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
21510_13_ITEM7_P52_S3	CLC spending increased $2.0 million primarily due to higher other variable spending and higher payroll spending.
21510_13_ITEM7_P52_S4	Spending for Corporate and other increased $3.4 million primarily due to higher stock-related compensation expense, higher other variable spending and higher payroll spending.
21510_13_ITEM7_P52_S5	Fiscal 2012 selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses decreased $11.0 million, or 7%, from fiscal 2011.
21510_13_ITEM7_P52_S6	The decrease was primarily due to $12.1 million lower payroll spending due to lower performance-related compensation spending net of higher headcount and increased salaries and $1.8 million lower other variable spending partially offset by $2.9 million higher stock-related compensation expense.
21510_13_ITEM7_P52_S7	On a segment basis, CLC spending decreased $4.2 million primarily due to lower payroll spending and lower other variable spending.
21510_13_ITEM7_P52_S8	SLS segment expenses decreased $4.4 million primarily due to lower payroll spending and lower other variable spending.
21510_13_ITEM7_P52_S9	Spending for Corporate and other decreased $2.4 million primarily due to lower payroll spending and lower other variable spending partially offset by higher stock-related compensation expense.
21510_13_ITEM7_P52_S10	Amortization of intangible assets Amortization of intangible assets decreased $5.3 million , or 51% , from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013 primarily due to the fourth quarter fiscal 2012 impairment of $4.0 million of Hypertronics intangibles and the completion of amortization of certain intangibles (including Hypertronics) related to prior acquisitions partially offset by amortization from the acquisitions of Lumera and Innolight in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.
21510_13_ITEM7_P52_S11	Amortization of intangible assets increased $2.3 million, or 28%, from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012 primarily due to the fourth quarter fiscal 2012 impairment of $4.0 million of Hypertronics intangibles partially offset by completion of amortization of certain intangibles related to prior acquisitions.
21510_13_ITEM7_P52_S12	Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net, decreased $3.2 million from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013 .
21510_13_ITEM7_P52_S13	The decrease was primarily due to higher net foreign currency exchange losses ($3.3 million) primarily due to the significant movement in the Japanese Yen at certain times in the first and third quarters of fiscal 2013.
21510_13_ITEM7_P52_S14	Other income (expense), net, decreased $10.0 million from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012.
21510_13_ITEM7_P52_S15	The decrease was primarily due to the $6.5 million non-recurring translation adjustment related to the dissolution of our Finland operations in the second quarter of fiscal 2011, lower net foreign currency exchange gains ($1.9 million) and lower gains on our deferred compensation plan assets net of expenses ($1.5 million) including death benefits of $0.2 million in fiscal 2012 and $1.5 million in fiscal 2011.
21510_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	Income taxes The effective tax rate on income before income taxes for fiscal 2013 of 20.5% was lower than the statutory rate of 35.0%.
21510_13_ITEM7_P53_S1	This was primarily due to permanent differences related to the benefit of income subject to foreign tax rates that are lower than U.S. tax rates including Korea and Singapore tax exemptions, the benefit of foreign tax credits, the benefit of the federal research and development tax credits including renewal of the federal research and development tax credits for fiscal 2012 and the benefit of releasing foreign tax reserves accrued under ASC 740-10 and related interest.
21510_13_ITEM7_P53_S2	These amounts are partially offset by deemed dividend inclusions under the Subpart F tax rules, stock compensation not deductible for tax purposes and limitations on the deductibility of compensation under IRC Section 162(m).
21510_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	During fiscal 2013, we increased our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by $4.3 million to $13.4 million primarily due to the reduced ability to utilize California and other states research and development tax credits.
21510_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	During fiscal 2012, we increased our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by $0.3 million to $9.1 million primarily due to the reduced ability to utilize California research and development tax credits and offset by the net increased ability to utilize foreign tax attributes and net operating losses of our subsidiaries.
21510_13_ITEM7_P54_S2	During fiscal 2011, we increased our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by $1.5 million to $8.8 million, primarily due to the reduced ability to utilize foreign tax attributes and net operating losses and the reduced ability to utilize California research and development tax credits as a result of releasing net unrecognized tax benefits under ASC 740-10 that supported the credits.
21510_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	In making the determination to record the valuation allowance, management considered the likelihood of future taxable income and feasible and prudent tax planning strategies to realize deferred tax assets.
21510_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	expect to realize deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the valuation allowance will affect income in the period such determination is made.
21510_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	The effective tax rate on income before income taxes for fiscal 2012 of 30.5% was lower than the statutory rate of 35.0%.
21510_13_ITEM7_P57_S1	No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes ) and related interest.
21510_13_ITEM7_P57_S2	The effective tax rate on income before income taxes for fiscal 2011 of 24.7% was lower than the statutory rate of 35.0%.
21510_13_ITEM7_P57_S3	This was primarily due to the benefit of releasing unrecognized tax benefits under ASC 740-10 and related interest, the benefit of federal research and development credits, including additional credits reinstated from fiscal 2010 resulting from the enactment of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Jobs Creation Acts of 2010, the benefit of foreign tax credits, the benefit of currency translation adjustments related to closure of Coherent Finland's operations, the benefit from income subject to foreign tax rates that are lower than U.S. tax rates and the benefit from the unrealized gain on life insurance policy investments related to our deferred compensation plans.
21510_13_ITEM7_P57_S4	These amounts are partially offset by state income tax, limitations on the utilization of certain foreign tax attributes and net operating losses, limitations on the deductibility of compensation under IRC Section 162(m), deemed dividend inclusions under the Subpart F tax rules and a currency translation adjustment related to a dividend from a foreign subsidiary.
21510_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 ( the Act ) was enacted on January 2, 2013.
21510_13_ITEM7_P58_S1	Under the Act, the federal research and development tax credit was retroactively extended for amounts paid or incurred after December 31, 2011 through December 31, 2013.
21510_13_ITEM7_P58_S2	The prior period effects of the change in the tax law were recognized in our second quarter of fiscal 2013, which is the quarter that the law was enacted.
21510_13_ITEM7_P58_S3	Accordingly, prior year research and development tax credits of approximately $1.4 million less appropriate reserves were recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2013.
21510_13_ITEM7_P58_S4	Coherent Korea received the final approval for a High-Tech tax exemption on March 26, 2013 from the Korean authorities.
21510_13_ITEM7_P58_S5	The High-Tech tax exemption is effective retroactively to the beginning of fiscal 2013 and is subject to capital contribution limitations.
21510_13_ITEM7_P58_S6	The impact of this tax exemption decreased Korean income taxes by approximately $2.1 million in fiscal 2013.
21510_13_ITEM7_P58_S7	The benefit of the tax holiday on net income per share (diluted) was $0.09.
21510_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	Coherent Singapore had previously received a Pioneer Status tax exemption from the Singapore authorities effective from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2017, and may be extended if certain additional requirements are satisfied.
21510_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	The tax holiday is conditional upon our meeting certain revenue, business spending and employment thresholds.
21510_13_ITEM7_P60_S1	Although Coherent Singapore had income in fiscal 2013, this amount was offset by a loss carryforward from fiscal 2012 and therefore we did not realize a benefit for the Singapore tax holiday in fiscal 2013 and 2012.
21510_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity and capital resources At September 28, 2013 , we had assets classified as cash and cash equivalents, as well as time deposits and fixed income securities classified as short-term investments, in an aggregate amount of $250.1 million , compared to $224.9 million at September 29, 2012 .
21510_13_ITEM7_P61_S1	At September 28, 2013 , approximately $157.5 million of the cash and securities was held in certain of our foreign subsidiaries, $89.9 million of which was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
21510_13_ITEM7_P61_S2	We currently have approximately $150.6 million of cash, including investments in U.S. Treasury securities, held by foreign subsidiaries where we intend to permanently reinvest our accumulated earnings in these entities and our current plans do not demonstrate a need for these funds to support our domestic operations.
21510_13_ITEM7_P61_S3	If, however, a portion of these funds were needed for and distributed to our operations in the United States, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes.
21510_13_ITEM7_P61_S4	The amount of the taxes due would depend on the amount and manner of repatriation, as well as the location from where the funds are repatriated.
21510_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	We actively monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold these assets, primarily focusing on the safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield on these assets.
21510_13_ITEM7_P62_S1	We diversify our cash and cash equivalents and investments among various financial institutions, money market funds and sovereign debt in order to reduce our exposure should any one of these financial institutions or financial instruments fail or encounter difficulties.
21510_13_ITEM7_P62_S2	To date, we have not experienced any material loss or lack of access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments.
21510_13_ITEM7_P62_S3	However, we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets.
21510_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	Sources and Uses of Cash Historically, our primary source of cash has been provided by operations.
21510_13_ITEM7_P63_S1	Other sources of cash in the past three fiscal years include proceeds received from the sale of our stock through our employee stock option and purchase plans.
21510_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	historical uses of cash have primarily been for the repurchase of our common stock, capital expenditures, acquisitions of businesses and technologies and the payment of a cash dividend in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.
21510_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $50.8 million in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 and decreased by $21.9 million in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 .
21510_13_ITEM7_P65_S1	The increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2013 was primarily due to higher cash flows from timing of accounts payable payments, improved inventory turns, timing of other current assets and liabilities as well as improved accounts receivable days sales outstanding partially offset by timing of tax payments.
21510_13_ITEM7_P65_S2	The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2012 was primarily due to lower net income, higher tax payments and lower cash flows from other current liabilities including variable compensation and accounts payable partially offset by higher cash flows from inventories and accounts receivable.
21510_13_ITEM7_P65_S3	We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short term investments combined with cash to be provided by operating activities will be adequate to cover our working capital needs and planned capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months to the extent such items are known or are reasonably determinable based on current business and market conditions.
21510_13_ITEM7_P65_S4	However, we may elect to finance certain of our capital expenditure requirements through borrowings under our bank credit facilities or other sources of capital.
21510_13_ITEM7_P65_S5	We continue to follow our strategy to further strengthen our financial position by using available cash flow to fund operations.
21510_13_ITEM7_P65_S6	We intend to continue pursuing acquisition opportunities at valuations we believe are reasonable based upon market conditions.
21510_13_ITEM7_P65_S7	However, we cannot accurately predict the timing, size and success of our acquisition efforts or our associated potential capital commitments.
21510_13_ITEM7_P65_S8	Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire businesses on terms acceptable to us.
21510_13_ITEM7_P65_S9	We expect to fund future acquisitions primarily through existing cash balances and cash flows from operations.
21510_13_ITEM7_P65_S10	If required, we will look for additional borrowings or consider the issuance of securities.
21510_13_ITEM7_P65_S11	The extent to which we will be willing or able to use our common stock to make acquisitions will depend on its market value at the time and the willingness of potential sellers to accept it as full or partial payment.
21510_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	On December 10, 2012, we announced that the Board of Directors approved a $1.00 per share special cash dividend on our outstanding common stock payable on December 27, 2012 to stockholders of record on December 19, 2012, resulting in a payment of $24.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.
21510_13_ITEM7_P66_S1	While we paid a cash dividend in fiscal 2013 and may elect to pay dividends in the future, we have no present intention to declare cash dividends.
21510_13_ITEM7_P66_S2	On January 26, 2011, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $75.0 million of our common stock.
21510_13_ITEM7_P66_S3	The program was authorized for 12 months from the date of authorization.
21510_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	In March 2011, we repurchased and retired 454,682 shares of outstanding common stock under a modified "Dutch Auction" tender offer at an average price of $59.00 per share for a total of $26.8 million, excluding expenses.
21510_13_ITEM7_P67_S1	During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2011, we repurchased and retired an additional 1,024,409 shares of outstanding common stock at an average price of $47.03 per share for a total of $48.2 million, excluding expenses.
21510_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	On August 25, 2011, we announced that the Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $50.0 million of our common stock.
21510_13_ITEM7_P68_S1	The program was authorized for 12 months from the date of authorization.
21510_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	During fiscal 2011, we repurchased and retired 586,200 shares of outstanding common stock at an average price of $42.67 per share for a total of $25.0 million, excluding expenses.
21510_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	During fiscal 2012, we repurchased and retired 543,200 shares of outstanding common stock at an average price of $45.99 per share for a total of $25.0 million, excluding expenses, completing the repurchase.
21510_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	On October 4, 2012 , the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $25.0 million of our common stock.
21510_13_ITEM7_P71_S1	The program was authorized for 12 months from the date of authorization.
21510_13_ITEM7_P71_S2	No shares were purchased under this program.
21510_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	During fiscal year 2008, we initiated restructuring plans to decrease costs by consolidating facilities and reducing our workforce.
21510_13_ITEM7_P72_S1	As of September 28, 2013 , we had made payments in connection with the restructuring plans in the amount of $27.7 million .
21510_13_ITEM7_P72_S2	We completed payments for substantially all anticipated costs related to the restructuring plans in the third quarter of fiscal 2011.
21510_13_ITEM7_P72_S3	Additional sources of cash available to us were domestic and international currency lines of credit and bank credit facilities totaling $64.7 million as of September 28, 2013 , of which $62.5 million was unused and available.
21510_13_ITEM7_P72_S4	These unsecured credit facilities were used in Europe and Japan during fiscal 2013 .
21510_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	Our domestic line of credit consists of a $50.0 million unsecured revolving credit account with Union Bank of California, which expires on May 31, 2014 and is subject to covenants related to financial ratios and tangible net worth.
21510_13_ITEM7_P73_S1	No amounts have been drawn upon our domestic line of credit and $2.3 million of the international currency lines has been used as guarantees as of September 28, 2013 .
21510_13_ITEM7_P73_S2	Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 4.3 :1 at September 28, 2013 , compared to 4.0 :1 at September 29, 2012 .
21510_13_ITEM7_P73_S3	The increase in our ratio is primarily due increases in cash and short-term investments and inventories as well as decreases in income taxes payable.
21510_13_ITEM7_P73_S4	Our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, working capital and debt obligations are as follows (in thousands):
21510_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933.
21510_13_ITEM7_P74_S1	The following summarizes our contractual obligations at September 28, 2013 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):
21510_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	Because of the uncertainty as to the timing of such payments, we have excluded cash payments related to our contractual obligations for our deferred compensation plans aggregating $26.1 million at September 28, 2013 .
21510_13_ITEM7_P75_S1	As of September 28, 2013 , we recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $23.2 million including gross interest and penalties of $1.8 million .
21510_13_ITEM7_P75_S2	As of September 29, 2012 , we recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $27.6 million including gross interest and penalties of $1.6 million .
21510_13_ITEM7_P75_S3	Both gross unrecognized tax benefits and gross interest and penalties are classified as non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
21510_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.
21510_13_ITEM7_P76_S1	As a result, these amounts are not included in the table above.
21510_13_ITEM7_P76_S2	Changes in financial condition Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2013 was $115.5 million , which included net income of $66.4 million , depreciation and amortization of $36.1 million , stock-based compensation expense of $18.9 million and $0.3 million other partially offset by cash used by operating assets and liabilities of $5.1 million and increases in net deferred tax assets of $1.1 million .
21510_13_ITEM7_P76_S3	Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2012 was $64.8 million , which included net income of $63.0 million , depreciation and amortization of $29.6 million , stock-based compensation expense of $16.3 million and the $4.1 million write-off of Hypertronics intangibles partially offset by cash used by operating assets and liabilities of $42.0 million , increases in net deferred tax assets of $4.8 million and $1.4 million other.
21510_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2013 of $70.7 million included $20.5 million , net, used to acquire property and equipment and improve buildings and $67.3 million used to acquire Lumera and Innolight partially offset by $17.1 million net sales of available-for-sale securities.
21510_13_ITEM7_P77_S1	Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2012 of $142.9 million included $103.5 million net purchases of available-for-sale securities, $35.7 million , net, used to acquire property and equipment and improve buildings and $3.7 million used to acquire Midaz.
21510_13_ITEM7_P77_S2	Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2013 was $11.7 million , including $24.0 million cash dividend on our common stock and $4.2 million other partially offset by $16.5 million generated from our employee stock purchase plans.
21510_13_ITEM7_P77_S3	Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2012 was $15.0 million , including $25.0 million used to repurchase our common stock and $3.3 million other partially offset by $13.3 million generated from our employee stock purchase plans.
21510_13_ITEM7_P77_S4	Changes in exchange rates in fiscal 2013 resulted in a decrease in cash balances of $9.5 million .
21510_13_ITEM7_P77_S5	Changes in exchange rates in fiscal 2012 resulted in a decrease in cash balances of $6.1 million .
21510_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 2.
21510_13_ITEM7_P78_S1	"Significant Accounting Policies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the respective dates of adoption or expected adoption and effects on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
21510_13_ITEM7_P79_S0	APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.
21510_13_ITEM7_P79_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
21510_13_ITEM7_P79_S2	We have identified the following as the items that require the most significant judgment and often involve complex estimation: revenue recognition, accounting for long-lived assets (including goodwill and intangible assets), inventory valuation, warranty reserves, stock-based compensation and accounting for income taxes.
21510_13_ITEM7_P80_S0	We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered or the service has been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable.
21510_13_ITEM7_P80_S1	Revenue from product sales is recorded when all of the foregoing conditions are met and risk of loss and title passes to the customer.
21510_13_ITEM7_P80_S2	Our products typically include a warranty and the estimated cost of product warranty claims (based on historical experience) is recorded at the time the sale is recognized.
21510_13_ITEM7_P80_S3	Sales to customers are generally not subject to any price protection or return rights.
21510_13_ITEM7_P80_S4	The vast majority of our sales are made to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), distributors, resellers and end-users in the non-scientific market.
21510_13_ITEM7_P80_S5	Sales made to these customers do not require installation of the products by us and are not subject to other post-delivery obligations, except in occasional instances where we have agreed to perform installation or provide training.
21510_13_ITEM7_P80_S6	In those instances, we defer revenue related to installation services or training until these services have been rendered.
21510_13_ITEM7_P80_S7	We allocate revenue from multiple element arrangements to the various elements based upon fair values or a selling price hierarchy, for arrangements entered into subsequent to October 2, 2010, as more fully described in Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition," in our consolidated financial statements.
21510_13_ITEM7_P80_S8	Should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions, revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected.
21510_13_ITEM7_P80_S9	Failure to obtain anticipated orders due to delays or cancellations of orders could have a material adverse effect on our revenue.
21510_13_ITEM7_P80_S10	In addition, pressures from customers to reduce our prices or to modify our existing sales terms may have a material adverse effect on our revenue in future periods.
21510_13_ITEM7_P80_S11	Our sales to distributors, resellers and end-user customers typically do not have customer acceptance provisions and only certain of our sales to OEM customers and integrators have customer acceptance provisions.
21510_13_ITEM7_P80_S12	Customer acceptance is generally limited to performance under our published product specifications.
21510_13_ITEM7_P80_S13	For the few product sales that have customer acceptance provisions because of higher than published specifications, (1) the products are tested and accepted by the customer at our site or the customer accepts the results of our testing program prior to shipment to the customer, or (2) the revenue is deferred until customer acceptance occurs.
21510_13_ITEM7_P81_S0	Sales to end-users in the scientific market typically require installation and, thus, involve post-delivery obligations; however our post-delivery installation obligations are not essential to the functionality of our products.
21510_13_ITEM7_P81_S1	We defer revenue related to installation services until completion of these services.
21510_13_ITEM7_P82_S0	For most products, training is not provided; therefore, no post-delivery training obligation exists.
21510_13_ITEM7_P82_S1	However, when training is provided to our customers, it is typically priced separately and recognized as revenue as these services are provided.
21510_13_ITEM7_P82_S2	For multiple element arrangements which include extended maintenance contracts, we allocate and defer the amount of consideration equal to the separately stated price and recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
21510_13_ITEM7_P83_S0	Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill We evaluate long-lived assets and amortizable intangible assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances or our planned use of assets indicate that their carrying amounts may not be fully recoverable or that their useful lives are no longer appropriate.
21510_13_ITEM7_P83_S1	Reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying values of the assets are impaired based on comparison to the undiscounted expected future cash flows identifiable to such long-lived and amortizable intangible assets.
21510_13_ITEM7_P83_S2	If the comparison indicates that impairment exists, the impaired asset is written down to its fair value.
21510_13_ITEM7_P84_S0	We have determined that our reporting units are the same as our operating segments as each constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results.
21510_13_ITEM7_P84_S1	We make this determination in a manner consistent with how the operating segments are managed.
21510_13_ITEM7_P84_S2	Based on this analysis, we have identified two reporting units which are our reportable segments: SLS and CLC.
21510_13_ITEM7_P85_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and written down when impaired (see Note 8 "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).
21510_13_ITEM7_P85_S1	We generally perform our annual impairment tests during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter, with any resulting impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.
21510_13_ITEM7_P85_S2	In September 2011, the FASB amended its guidance to simplify testing goodwill for impairment, allowing an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.
21510_13_ITEM7_P85_S3	If an entity determines as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not ( 50% likelihood) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative test is required.
21510_13_ITEM7_P85_S4	Moreover, an entity can bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the impairment test, and then resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period.
21510_13_ITEM7_P85_S5	Otherwise, no further testing is required.
21510_13_ITEM7_P85_S6	We adopted this accounting guidance for our impairment testing in fiscal 2012.
21510_13_ITEM7_P86_S0	Under the goodwill standards in effect for fiscal 2011, a company could carry forward the detailed determination of a reporting unit from one year to the next if certain criteria have been met.
21510_13_ITEM7_P86_S1	Those criteria include: the assets and liabilities that make up the reporting unit have not changed significantly since the most recent fair value determination, the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting unit by a substantial margin, and based on an analysis of events that have occurred and circumstances that have changed since the most recent fair value determination, the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is remote.
21510_13_ITEM7_P86_S2	Based on our analysis and a review of the criteria, using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we determined that we had met the requirements of the goodwill standard for carrying forward our fair value determination from fiscal 2010, and did not perform detailed testing of the fair value of our reporting units for fiscal 2011.
21510_13_ITEM7_P86_S3	Between the completion of that testing and the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we noted no indications of impairment or triggering events to cause us to review goodwill for potential impairment; based on our evaluation, the fair values of each of the two operating segments significantly exceeded their carrying value as of that date.
21510_13_ITEM7_P87_S0	In our fiscal 2012 annual testing, we performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying amount.
21510_13_ITEM7_P87_S1	In assessing the qualitative factors, we considered the impact of these key factors: macroeconomic conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency, market and industry conditions, our operating and competitive environment, regulatory and political developments, the overall financial performance of our reporting units including cost factors and budgeted-to-actual revenue results.
21510_13_ITEM7_P87_S2	We also considered market capitalization and stock price performance.
21510_13_ITEM7_P87_S3	Based on our assessment, goodwill in the reporting units was not impaired as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.
21510_13_ITEM7_P87_S4	As such, it was not necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test at that time.
21510_13_ITEM7_P88_S0	In fiscal 2013, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test.
21510_13_ITEM7_P88_S1	This election was made because we had last performed this impairment test in fiscal 2010 and we have subsequently added a substantial amount of goodwill balances as a result of our acquisitions of Midaz in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and the acquisitions of Innolight and Lumera in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.
21510_13_ITEM7_P88_S2	We performed our Step 1 test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and noted no impairment.
21510_13_ITEM7_P88_S3	We determined the fair value of our reporting units for the Step 1 test using a 50-50% weighting of the Income (discounted cash flow) approach and Market (market comparable) approach.
21510_13_ITEM7_P89_S0	The Income approach utilizes the discounted cash flow model to provide an estimation of fair value based on the cash flows that a business expects to generate.
21510_13_ITEM7_P89_S1	These cash flows are based on forecasts developed internally by management which are then discounted at an after tax rate of return required by equity and debt market participants of a business enterprise.
21510_13_ITEM7_P89_S2	This rate of return or cost of capital is weighted based on the capitalization of comparable companies.
21510_13_ITEM7_P90_S0	The Market approach determines fair value by comparing the reporting units to comparable companies in similar lines of business that are publicly traded.
21510_13_ITEM7_P90_S1	Total Enterprise Value (TEV) multiples such as TEV to revenues and TEV to earnings (if applicable) before interest and taxes of the publicly traded companies are calculated.
21510_13_ITEM7_P90_S2	These multiples are then applied to the reporting unit's operating results to obtain an estimate of fair value.
21510_13_ITEM7_P90_S3	Each of these two approaches captures aspects of value in each reporting unit.
21510_13_ITEM7_P90_S4	The Income approach captures our expected future performance, and the Market approach captures how investors view the reporting units through other competitors.
21510_13_ITEM7_P90_S5	We believe these valuation approaches are proven valuation techniques and methodologies for our industry and are widely accepted by investors.
21510_13_ITEM7_P90_S6	As neither was perceived by us to deliver any greater indication of value than the other, we weighted each of the approaches equally.
21510_13_ITEM7_P90_S7	Management completed and reviewed the results of the Step 1 analysis and concluded that a Step 2 analysis was not required as the estimated fair values of both of our reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values.
21510_13_ITEM7_P90_S8	Between the completion of that testing and the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we noted no indications of impairment or triggering events to cause us to review goodwill for potential impairment.
21510_13_ITEM7_P91_S0	At September 28, 2013 , we had $113.4 million of goodwill, $43.0 million of purchased intangible assets and $114.3 million of property and equipment on our consolidated balance sheet.
21510_13_ITEM7_P92_S0	Inventory Valuation We record our inventory at the lower of cost (computed on a first-in, first-out basis) or market.
21510_13_ITEM7_P92_S1	We write-down our inventory to its estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
21510_13_ITEM7_P92_S2	Inventory write-downs are generally recorded within guidelines set by management when the inventory for a device exceeds 12 months of its demand and when individual parts have been in inventory for greater than 12 months.
21510_13_ITEM7_P92_S3	If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required which could materially affect our future results of operations.
21510_13_ITEM7_P92_S4	Due to rapidly changing forecasts and orders, additional write-downs for excess or obsolete inventory, while not currently expected, could be required in the future.
21510_13_ITEM7_P92_S5	In the event that alternative future uses of fully written down inventories are identified, we may experience better than normal profit margins when such inventory is sold.
21510_13_ITEM7_P92_S6	Differences between actual results and previous estimates of excess and obsolete inventory could materially affect our future results of operations.
21510_13_ITEM7_P93_S0	We write-down our demo inventory by amortizing the cost of demo inventory over a twenty month period starting from the fourth month after such inventory is placed in service.
21510_13_ITEM7_P93_S1	We provide warranties on the majority of our product sales and allowances for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale.
21510_13_ITEM7_P93_S2	The determination of such allowances requires us to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty.
21510_13_ITEM7_P93_S3	We currently establish warranty reserves based on historical warranty costs for each product line.
21510_13_ITEM7_P93_S4	The weighted average warranty period covered is approximately 15 months.
21510_13_ITEM7_P93_S5	If actual return rates and/or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates, adjustments to cost of sales may be required in future periods.
21510_13_ITEM7_P94_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation using fair value.
21510_13_ITEM7_P94_S1	We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes Merton model and estimate the fair value of market-based performance restricted stock units granted using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
21510_13_ITEM7_P94_S2	We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.
21510_13_ITEM7_P94_S3	We amortize the fair value of stock options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods.
21510_13_ITEM7_P94_S4	We value service-based restricted stock units using the intrinsic value method and amortize the value on a straight-line basis over the restriction period.
21510_13_ITEM7_P94_S5	We value market-based performance restricted stock units using a Monte Carlo simulation model and amortize the value over the performance period, with no adjustment in future periods, based upon the actual shareholder return over the performance period.
21510_13_ITEM7_P95_S0	U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") requires the use of option pricing models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options.
21510_13_ITEM7_P96_S0	The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short-lived exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
21510_13_ITEM7_P96_S1	In addition, option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the options expected life, the expected price volatility of the underlying stock and an estimate of expected forfeitures.
21510_13_ITEM7_P97_S0	Our computation of expected volatility considers historical volatility and market-based implied volatility.
21510_13_ITEM7_P97_S1	Our estimate of expected forfeitures is based on historical employee data and could differ from actual forfeitures.
21510_13_ITEM7_P97_S2	See Note 14 "Employee Stock Option and Benefit Plans" in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our stock-based employee compensation plans and the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of stock-based employee compensation.
21510_13_ITEM7_P98_S0	Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income tax provision (benefit) in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
21510_13_ITEM7_P98_S1	This process involves us estimating our current income tax provision (benefit) together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
21510_13_ITEM7_P98_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets.
21510_13_ITEM7_P99_S0	We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized.
21510_13_ITEM7_P99_S1	While we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made.
21510_13_ITEM7_P99_S2	Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.
21510_13_ITEM7_P100_S0	Federal income taxes have not been provided for on a portion of the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested.
21510_13_ITEM7_P100_S1	The total amount of unremitted earnings and accumulated translation adjustments of foreign subsidiaries for which we have not yet recorded federal and state income taxes was approximately $335.4 million and $52.7 million , respectively, at fiscal 2013 year-end.
21510_13_ITEM7_P100_S2	The amount of federal and state income taxes that would be payable upon repatriation of such earnings are not practicably determinable.
21510_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
21510_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
21510_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Interest rate sensitivity A portion of our investment portfolio is composed of fixed income securities.
21510_13_ITEM7A_P1_S1	These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase.
21510_13_ITEM7A_P1_S2	If interest rates were to increase immediately (whether due to changes in overall market rates or credit worthiness of the issuers of our individual securities) and uniformly by 10% from levels at fiscal 2013 year-end, the fair value of the portfolio, based on quoted market prices in active markets involving similar assets, would decline by an immaterial amount due to their short-term maturities.
21510_13_ITEM7A_P1_S3	We have the ability to generally hold our fixed income investments until maturity and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio.
21510_13_ITEM7A_P1_S4	If necessary, we may sell short-term investments prior to maturity to meet our liquidity needs.
21510_13_ITEM7A_P1_S5	At fiscal 2013 year-end, the fair value of our available-for-sale debt securities was $139.7 million, all of which was classified as short-term investments.
21510_13_ITEM7A_P1_S6	Gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities were $601,000 and $(16,000) , respectively, at fiscal 2013 year-end.
21510_13_ITEM7A_P1_S7	At fiscal 2012 year-end, the fair value of our available-for-sale debt securities was $155.1 million, all of which was classified as short-term investments.
21510_13_ITEM7A_P1_S8	Gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities were $952,000 and ($3,000), respectively, at fiscal 2012 year-end.
21510_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Foreign currency exchange risk We maintain operations in various countries outside of the United States and have foreign subsidiaries that manufacture and sell our products in various global markets.
21510_13_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The majority of our sales are transacted in U.S. dollars.
21510_13_ITEM7A_P2_S2	However, we do generate revenues in other currencies, primarily the Japanese Yen, the Euro and the Korean Won.
21510_13_ITEM7A_P3_S0	flows and cash balances are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
21510_13_ITEM7A_P3_S1	We attempt to limit these exposures through financial market instruments.
21510_13_ITEM7A_P3_S2	We utilize derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts with maturities of three months or less, to manage our exposure associated with anticipated cash flows and net asset and liability positions denominated in foreign currencies.
21510_13_ITEM7A_P3_S3	Gains and losses on the forward contracts are mitigated by gains and losses on the underlying instruments.
21510_13_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
21510_13_ITEM7A_P4_S1	We do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments.
21510_13_ITEM7A_P4_S2	There can be no assurance that these strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately.
21510_13_ITEM7A_P4_S3	For example, the Japanese Yen has recently decreased significantly in value and the Euro has recently strengthened in value.
21510_13_ITEM7A_P4_S4	While we model currency valuations and fluctuations, these may not ultimately be accurate.
21510_13_ITEM7A_P4_S5	If a financial counterparty to any of our hedging arrangements experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge, we may experience material financial losses.
21510_13_ITEM7A_P5_S0	In the current economic environment, the risk of failure of a financial party remains high.
21510_13_ITEM7A_P6_S0	At September 28, 2013, approximately $157.5 million of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were held outside the U.S. in certain of our foreign operations, $89.9 million of which was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
21510_13_ITEM7A_P6_S1	A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency rates on our forward contracts would not have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
21510_13_ITEM7A_P7_S0	The following table provides information about our foreign exchange forward contracts at September 28, 2013 .
21510_13_ITEM7A_P7_S1	The table presents the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates, the value of the contracts in U.S. dollars at the contract exchange rate as of the contract maturity date and fair value.
21510_13_ITEM7A_P7_S2	The U.S. notional fair value represents the contracted amount valued at September 28, 2013 rates.
21510_13_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Forward contracts to sell (buy) foreign currencies (in thousands, except contract rates):
21510_13_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by this annual report ("Evaluation Date").
21510_13_ITEM9A_P0_S1	The controls evaluation was done under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.
21510_13_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
21510_13_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the Company.
21510_13_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2013 , utilizing the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (1992).
21510_13_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on the assessment by management, we determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 28, 2013 .
21510_13_ITEM9A_P1_S3	The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2013 has been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears below.
21510_13_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Inherent Limitations Over Internal Controls Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
21510_13_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
21510_13_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
21510_13_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
21510_13_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
21510_13_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud.
21510_13_ITEM9A_P4_S0	A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
21510_13_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
21510_13_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
21510_13_ITEM9A_P4_S3	Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
21510_13_ITEM9A_P4_S4	There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 28, 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
21510_13_ITEM9A_P5_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Coherent, Inc.: We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Coherent, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") as of September 28, 2013 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
21510_13_ITEM9A_P5_S1	The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
21510_13_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
21510_13_ITEM9A_P5_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
21510_13_ITEM9A_P5_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
21510_13_ITEM9A_P5_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
21510_13_ITEM9A_P5_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
21510_13_ITEM9A_P6_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
21510_13_ITEM9A_P6_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
21510_13_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
21510_13_ITEM9A_P6_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
21510_13_ITEM9A_P6_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2013 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
21510_13_ITEM9A_P6_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 28, 2013 , of the Company and our report dated November 27, 2013, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

21510_13_ITEM15_P14_S0	Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30.
21510_13_ITEM15_P14_S1	Fiscal years 2013 , 2012 and 2011 ended on September 28, 2013 , September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011 , respectively, and are referred to in these financial statements as fiscal 2013 , fiscal 2012 , and fiscal 2011 for convenience.
21510_13_ITEM15_P14_S2	All fiscal years include 52 weeks.
21510_13_ITEM15_P14_S3	Accordingly, the financial statements of these subsidiaries as of that date and for the years then ended have been used for our consolidated financial statements.
21510_13_ITEM15_P14_S4	Management believes that the impact of the use of different year-ends is immaterial to our consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.
21510_13_ITEM15_P15_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
21510_13_ITEM15_P15_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
21510_13_ITEM15_P16_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Coherent, Inc. and its majority-owned subsidiaries (collectively, "the Company", "we", "our", or "Coherent").
21510_13_ITEM15_P16_S1	Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
21510_13_ITEM15_P17_S0	Investments in business entities in which we do not have control, but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies (generally 20% - 50% ownership) are accounted for by the equity method.
21510_13_ITEM15_P17_S1	We currently do not have any investments accounted for by the equity method.
21510_13_ITEM15_P17_S2	Minority interests in non-wholly owned subsidiaries are insignificant.
21510_13_ITEM15_P17_S3	The carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
21510_13_ITEM15_P18_S0	Short-term investments are comprised of available-for-sale securities, which are carried at fair value.
21510_13_ITEM15_P18_S1	Other non-current assets include trading securities and life insurance contracts related to our deferred compensation plans; trading securities are carried at fair value and life insurance contracts are carried at cash surrender values, which due to their ability to be converted to cash at that amount, approximate their fair values.
21510_13_ITEM15_P18_S2	The recorded carrying amount of our long-term obligations approximates fair value at fiscal 2013 and 2012 year-ends.
21510_13_ITEM15_P19_S0	Foreign exchange contracts are stated at fair value based on prevailing financial market information.
21510_13_ITEM15_P20_S0	Cash Equivalents All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.
21510_13_ITEM15_P21_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that may potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable.
21510_13_ITEM15_P21_S1	At fiscal 2013 year-end, the majority of our short-term investments are in US Treasury and federal agency obligations and corporate notes and obligations.
21510_13_ITEM15_P21_S2	Cash equivalents and short-term investments are maintained with several financial institutions and may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such balances.
21510_13_ITEM15_P21_S3	At September 28, 2013 , we held cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments outside the U.S. in certain of our foreign operations totaling approximately $157.5 million , $89.9 million of which was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
21510_13_ITEM15_P22_S0	The majority of our accounts receivable are derived from sales to customers for commercial applications.
21510_13_ITEM15_P22_S1	We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition and limit the amount of credit extended when deemed necessary but generally require no collateral.
21510_13_ITEM15_P22_S2	We maintain reserves for potential credit losses.

21510_13_ITEM15_P23_S1	There were two customers who accounted for 14.9% and 14.8% of accounts receivable at fiscal 2012 year-end.
21510_13_ITEM15_P24_S0	Accounts Receivable Allowances Accounts receivable allowances reflect our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our accounts receivable balances.
21510_13_ITEM15_P24_S1	We regularly review allowances by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality, the age of the accounts receivable balances and current economic conditions that may affect a customer's ability to pay.
21510_13_ITEM15_P25_S0	Activity in accounts receivable allowance is as follows (in thousands):

21510_13_ITEM15_P28_S0	The fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.
21510_13_ITEM15_P28_S1	The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset.

21510_13_ITEM15_P30_S1	We estimated that as of fiscal 2013 year-end, gross expected future cash flows of $2.5 million would be required to fulfill these obligations.
21510_13_ITEM15_P30_S2	The following table reconciles changes in our asset retirement liability for fiscal 2013 and 2012 (in thousands):
21510_13_ITEM15_P31_S0	At September 28, 2013 and September 29, 2012 , the asset retirement liability is included in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
21510_13_ITEM15_P32_S0	Long-lived Assets We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, whenever events or changes in business circumstances or our planned use of long-lived assets indicate that their carrying amounts may not be fully recoverable or that their useful lives are no longer appropriate.
21510_13_ITEM15_P32_S1	Reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying values of long-lived assets are impaired based on a comparison to the undiscounted expected future net cash flows.
21510_13_ITEM15_P32_S2	If the comparison indicates that impairment exists, long-lived assets that are classified as held and used are written down to their respective fair values.
21510_13_ITEM15_P33_S0	When long-lived assets are classified as held for sale, they are written down to their respective fair values less costs to sell.
21510_13_ITEM15_P33_S1	Significant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that is used in the preparation of expected undiscounted cash flows.
21510_13_ITEM15_P33_S2	For fiscal years 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , there were no significant asset impairments recorded.
21510_13_ITEM15_P33_S3	Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and written down when impaired (see Note 8.
21510_13_ITEM15_P34_S0	In testing for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50% ) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
21510_13_ITEM15_P34_S1	Moreover, an entity can bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the impairment test, and then resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period.
21510_13_ITEM15_P35_S0	In fiscal 2012, we performed a qualitative assessment.
21510_13_ITEM15_P35_S1	In fiscal 2013, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test.
21510_13_ITEM15_P35_S2	This election was made because we had last performed this impairment test in fiscal 2010 and we have subsequently added a substantial amount of goodwill balances as a result of our acquisitions of Midaz in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and the acquisitions of Innolight and Lumera in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.
21510_13_ITEM15_P35_S3	We performed our Step 1 test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and noted no impairment.
21510_13_ITEM15_P35_S4	Between the completion of that testing and the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we noted no indications of impairment or triggering events to cause us to review goodwill for potential impairment.
21510_13_ITEM15_P35_S5	Absent any impairment indicators, we perform our annual impairment tests during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year using opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter, with any resulting impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.
21510_13_ITEM15_P36_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets, including acquired existing technology, customer lists, trade name and non-compete agreements are amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of 1 year to 15 years.

21510_13_ITEM15_P38_S0	Warranty Reserves We provide warranties on the majority of our product sales and reserves for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale.
21510_13_ITEM15_P38_S1	The determination of such reserves requires us to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty.
21510_13_ITEM15_P38_S2	We currently establish warranty reserves based on historical warranty costs for each product line.
21510_13_ITEM15_P38_S3	The weighted average warranty period covered is approximately 15 months .
21510_13_ITEM15_P38_S4	If actual return rates and/or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates, adjustments to cost of sales may be required in future periods.
21510_13_ITEM15_P39_S0	Components of the reserve for warranty costs during fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 were as follows (in thousands):
21510_13_ITEM15_P40_S0	Revenue Recognition When a sales arrangement contains multiple elements, such as products and/or services, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy.
21510_13_ITEM15_P40_S1	Using the selling price hierarchy, we determine the selling price of each deliverable using vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ), if it exists, and otherwise third-party evidence ( TPE ).
21510_13_ITEM15_P40_S2	If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exists, we use estimated selling price ( ESP ).
21510_13_ITEM15_P40_S3	We generally expect that we will not be able to establish TPE due to the nature of the markets in which we compete, and, as such, we typically will determine selling price using VSOE or if not available, ESP.
21510_13_ITEM15_P41_S0	Our basis for establishing VSOE of a deliverable's selling price consists of standalone sales transactions when the same or similar product or service is sold separately.
21510_13_ITEM15_P41_S1	However, when services are never sold separately, such as product installation services, VSOE is based on the product's estimated installation hours based on historical experience multiplied by the standard service billing rate.
21510_13_ITEM15_P42_S0	In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling price for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow price range, as defined by us.
21510_13_ITEM15_P42_S1	We also consider the geographies in which the products or services are sold, major product and service groups, and other environmental variables in determining VSOE.
21510_13_ITEM15_P42_S2	Absent the existence of VSOE and TPE, our determination of a deliverable's ESP involves evaluating several factors based on the specific facts and circumstances of these arrangements, which include pricing strategy and policies driven by geographies, market conditions, competitive landscape, correlation between proportionate selling price and list price established by management having the relevant authority, and other environmental variables in which the deliverable is sold.
21510_13_ITEM15_P43_S0	For multiple element arrangements which include extended maintenance contracts, we allocate and defer the amount of consideration equal to the separately stated price and recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
21510_13_ITEM15_P43_S1	We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered or the service has been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured.
21510_13_ITEM15_P43_S2	Revenue from product sales is recorded when all of the foregoing conditions are met and risk of loss and title passes to the customer.
21510_13_ITEM15_P43_S3	Sales to customers are generally not subject to any price protection or return rights.
21510_13_ITEM15_P43_S4	The vast majority of our sales are made to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), distributors, resellers and end-users in the non-scientific market.
21510_13_ITEM15_P43_S5	Sales made to these customers do not require installation of the products by us and are not subject to other post-delivery obligations, except in occasional instances where we have agreed to perform installation or provide training.
21510_13_ITEM15_P43_S6	In those instances, we defer revenue related to installation services or training until these services have been rendered.
21510_13_ITEM15_P43_S7	We allocate revenue from multiple element arrangements to the various elements based upon relative fair values.
21510_13_ITEM15_P44_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2.
21510_13_ITEM15_P45_S0	Our sales to distributors, resellers and end-user customers typically do not have customer acceptance provisions and only certain of our sales to OEM customers and integrators have customer acceptance provisions.
21510_13_ITEM15_P45_S1	Customer acceptance is generally limited to performance under our published product specifications.
21510_13_ITEM15_P45_S2	For the few product sales that have customer acceptance provisions because of higher than published specifications, (1) the products are tested and accepted by the customer at our site or the customer accepts the results of our testing program prior to shipment to the customer, or (2) the revenue is deferred until customer acceptance occurs.
21510_13_ITEM15_P46_S0	Sales to end-users in the scientific market typically require installation and, thus, involve post-delivery obligations; however, our post-delivery installation obligations are not essential to the functionality of our products.
21510_13_ITEM15_P46_S1	We defer revenue related to installation services until completion of these services.
21510_13_ITEM15_P47_S0	For most products, training is not provided; therefore, no post-delivery training obligation exists.
21510_13_ITEM15_P47_S1	However, when training is provided to our customers, it is typically priced separately and is recognized as revenue as these services are provided.
21510_13_ITEM15_P48_S0	We record taxes collected on revenue-producing activities on a net basis.
21510_13_ITEM15_P48_S1	Research and Development Research and development expenses include salaries, contractor and consultant fees, supplies and materials, as well as costs related to other overhead such as depreciation, facilities, utilities and other departmental expenses.
21510_13_ITEM15_P48_S2	The costs we incur with respect to internally developed technology and engineering services are included in research and development expenses as incurred as they do not directly relate to any particular licensee, license agreement or license fee.
21510_13_ITEM15_P48_S3	We treat third party and government funding of our research and development activity, where we are the primary beneficiary of such work conducted, as a credit to research and development cost.
21510_13_ITEM15_P48_S4	Amounts offset against research and development costs were not material in any of the periods presented.
21510_13_ITEM15_P49_S0	The functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are generally their respective local currencies.
21510_13_ITEM15_P49_S1	Accordingly, gains and losses from the translation of the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income ("OCI").
21510_13_ITEM15_P49_S2	Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in earnings.
21510_13_ITEM15_P50_S0	Derivatives U.S. GAAP requires that all derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.
21510_13_ITEM15_P50_S1	If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings.
21510_13_ITEM15_P50_S2	If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of the changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in OCI and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings.
21510_13_ITEM15_P50_S3	Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in other income (expense).
21510_13_ITEM15_P51_S0	Our objective of holding derivatives is to minimize the risks of foreign currency fluctuation by using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impact of these exposures.
21510_13_ITEM15_P52_S0	Principal currencies hedged include the Euro, Korean Won, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Chinese Renminbi and Singapore dollar.
21510_13_ITEM15_P52_S1	Forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to hedge the impact of the variability in exchange rates on accounts receivable and collections denominated in certain foreign currencies.
21510_13_ITEM15_P53_S0	Our forward contracts have maturities of two months or less and changes in fair value of these derivatives are recognized in other income (expense).

21510_13_ITEM15_P55_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period, excluding unvested restricted stock.
21510_13_ITEM15_P55_S1	Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period increased by the effect of dilutive employee stock awards, including stock options, restricted stock awards and stock purchase contracts, using the treasury stock method.
21510_13_ITEM15_P55_S2	The following table presents information necessary to calculate basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share (in thousands, except per share data):
21510_13_ITEM15_P56_S0	_______________________________________ (1) Net of unvested restricted stock A total of 883 ; 99,912 ; and 2,416 potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the dilutive share calculation for fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively, as their effect was anti-dilutive.
21510_13_ITEM15_P57_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation using the fair value of the awards granted.
21510_13_ITEM15_P57_S1	We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes Merton model.
21510_13_ITEM15_P57_S2	We value restricted stock units using the intrinsic value method.
21510_13_ITEM15_P58_S0	We use a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the fair value of market-based performance restricted stock units.
21510_13_ITEM15_P58_S1	We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option and restricted stock unit forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those options and awards that are expected to vest.
21510_13_ITEM15_P58_S2	We amortize the fair value of stock options and awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods.
21510_13_ITEM15_P58_S3	See Note 14 "Employee Stock Option and Benefit Plans" for a description of our stock-based employee compensation plans and the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of stock-based employee compensation.
21510_13_ITEM15_P59_S0	We record costs related to shipping and handling of revenue in cost of sales for all periods presented.
21510_13_ITEM15_P59_S1	Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were $3.4 million , $3.5 million and $4.1 million in fiscal 2013 , fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 , respectively.
21510_13_ITEM15_P60_S0	Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income tax provision (benefit) in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
21510_13_ITEM15_P60_S1	This process involves us estimating our current income tax provision (benefit) together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
21510_13_ITEM15_P60_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets.
21510_13_ITEM15_P61_S0	We account for uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740-10 (formerly FASB Financial Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes ), which creates a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.
21510_13_ITEM15_P61_S1	This standard provides a two-step approach for evaluating tax positions.
21510_13_ITEM15_P62_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2.
21510_13_ITEM15_P63_S0	when a company concludes (based solely on the technical aspects of the matter) that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority.
21510_13_ITEM15_P63_S1	The second step, measurement, is only considered after step one has been satisfied and measures any tax benefit at the largest amount that is deemed more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the uncertainty.
21510_13_ITEM15_P63_S2	These determinations involve significant judgment by management.
21510_13_ITEM15_P63_S3	Tax positions that fail to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first subsequent interim period that they meet the more likely than not standard or when they are resolved through negotiation or litigation with factual interpretation, judgment and certainty.
21510_13_ITEM15_P64_S0	Tax laws and regulations themselves are complex and are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, evolution of regulations and court filings.
21510_13_ITEM15_P64_S1	Therefore, the actual liability for U.S. or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially to reverse previously recorded tax liabilities.
21510_13_ITEM15_P65_S0	We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized.
21510_13_ITEM15_P65_S1	While we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made.
21510_13_ITEM15_P65_S2	Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.
21510_13_ITEM15_P66_S0	Federal income taxes have not been provided for on a portion of the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested.
21510_13_ITEM15_P66_S1	The total amount of unremitted earnings and accumulated translation adjustments of foreign subsidiaries for which we have not yet recorded federal and state income taxes was approximately $335.4 million and $52.7 million respectively, at fiscal 2013 year-end.
21510_13_ITEM15_P66_S2	The amount of federal and state income taxes that would be payable upon repatriation of such earnings are not practicably determinable.
21510_13_ITEM15_P67_S0	In July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued guidance that permits the Fed Funds Effective Swap Rate (OIS) to be used as a U.S. benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes, in addition to the direct Treasury obligations of the U.S. government (UST) and London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).
21510_13_ITEM15_P67_S1	The amendments also remove the restriction on using different benchmark rates for similar hedges.
21510_13_ITEM15_P67_S2	The amendments are effective prospectively for qualifying new or redesignated hedging relationships entered into on or after July 17, 2013.
21510_13_ITEM15_P68_S0	The adoption of this amendment did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
21510_13_ITEM15_P69_S0	In July 2012, the FASB amended existing guidance related to goodwill and other intangible assets by giving an entity testing an indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount.
21510_13_ITEM15_P69_S1	If the entity determines, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not more likely than not impaired, the entity would not need to calculate the fair value of the asset.
21510_13_ITEM15_P69_S2	The guidance does not revise the requirement to test indefinite-lived intangible assets annually for impairment or to test these assets for impairment between annual tests if there is a change in events or circumstances.
21510_13_ITEM15_P69_S3	This amended guidance was effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012.
21510_13_ITEM15_P69_S4	We adopted this authoritative guidance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.
21510_13_ITEM15_P69_S5	As of September 2013 and 2012, the implementation of this authoritative guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows in connection with our impairment testing.
21510_13_ITEM15_P70_S0	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In July of 2013, the FASB issued amended guidance that resolves the diversity in practice for the presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists.
21510_13_ITEM15_P70_S1	This new accounting guidance requires the netting of unrecognized tax benefits ("UTBs") against a deferred tax asset for a loss or other carryforward that would apply in settlement of the uncertain tax positions.
21510_13_ITEM15_P70_S2	Under the new standard, UTBs will be netted against all available same-jurisdiction losses or other tax carryforwards that would be utilized, rather than only against carryforwards that are created by the UTBs.
21510_13_ITEM15_P71_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2.
21510_13_ITEM15_P72_S0	We will consider the FASB s amended guidance for our fiscal year beginning September 28, 2014.
21510_13_ITEM15_P72_S1	We do not expect the amended guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
21510_13_ITEM15_P73_S0	In March 2013, the FASB issued guidance regarding the treatment of cumulative translation adjustment ("CTA") by a parent company upon de-recognition of a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity.
21510_13_ITEM15_P73_S1	The objective is to resolve the diversity in practice regarding the release into net income of such CTA.
21510_13_ITEM15_P73_S2	The guidance is effective for us beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2014.
21510_13_ITEM15_P73_S3	We are currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
21510_13_ITEM15_P74_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued guidance which requires an entity to disclose additional information for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI").
21510_13_ITEM15_P74_S1	For items reclassified out of AOCI and into net income in their entirety, entities are required to disclose the effect of the reclassification on each affected net income line item.
21510_13_ITEM15_P74_S2	For AOCI reclassification items that are not reclassified in their entirety into net income, a cross reference to other disclosures is required.
21510_13_ITEM15_P74_S3	This information may be provided either in the notes or parenthetically on the face of the statement that reports net income as long as all the information is disclosed in a single location.
21510_13_ITEM15_P74_S4	The guidance is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and we plan to adopt this guidance at the effective date.
21510_13_ITEM15_P74_S5	We do not expect the adoption of this accounting standard will have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
21510_13_ITEM15_P75_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance which requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable financial statement users to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements, including rights of setoff associated with the entity's recognized financial assets and liabilities, on the entity's financial position.
21510_13_ITEM15_P75_S1	The new disclosures will enable financial statement users to compare balance sheets prepared under U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS"), which are subject to different offsetting models.
21510_13_ITEM15_P75_S2	The disclosures will be limited to financial instruments (and derivatives) subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements.
21510_13_ITEM15_P75_S3	Similar agreements include derivative clearing agreements, global master repurchase agreements, and global master securities lending agreements.
21510_13_ITEM15_P75_S4	Financial instruments and transactions that will be subject to the disclosure requirements may include derivatives, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities lending and borrowing arrangements.
21510_13_ITEM15_P75_S5	An entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented.
21510_13_ITEM15_P75_S6	The guidance is effective for us beginning in fiscal 2014.
21510_13_ITEM15_P75_S7	We are currently evaluating the additional disclosures required, if any, from the adoption of this guidance.
21510_13_ITEM15_P76_S0	RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES During fiscal 2008, we initiated restructuring plans to decrease costs by consolidating facilities and reducing our workforce.
21510_13_ITEM15_P76_S1	During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we announced our plans to close our facilities in Tampere, Finland and St. Louis, Missouri.
21510_13_ITEM15_P76_S2	The closure of our St. Louis site was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.
21510_13_ITEM15_P76_S3	The closure of our Finland site was scheduled for completion by the end of fiscal 2010, but we delayed the closure due to increased demand for products manufactured in Finland.
21510_13_ITEM15_P76_S4	In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we ceased manufacturing operations in our Finland facility and recognized a $6.1 million gain, primarily in other income (expense), due to a non-recurring translation adjustment related to the dissolution of our Finland operations.
21510_13_ITEM15_P76_S5	We exited the facility in the third quarter of fiscal 2011.
21510_13_ITEM15_P76_S6	These closure plans resulted in charges primarily for employee termination and other exit related costs associated with a plan approved by management.
21510_13_ITEM15_P77_S0	During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we acquired the assets and certain liabilities of StockerYale, Inc's laser module product line in Montreal, Canada and transitioned those activities to other Coherent facilities in Salem, Massachusetts, Wilsonville, Oregon and Sunnyvale, California.
21510_13_ITEM15_P77_S1	The transfer was completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2011.
21510_13_ITEM15_P77_S2	These closure plans resulted in charges primarily for employee termination and other exit related costs associated with a plan approved by management.
21510_13_ITEM15_P77_S3	There were no new restructuring charges during fiscal 2013 and all charges related to restructuring activities discussed above were expensed as of the end of fiscal 2012.
21510_13_ITEM15_P77_S4	Restructuring charges during fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 are recorded in cost of sales, research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations.
21510_13_ITEM15_P78_S0	The following table presents our current liability as accrued on our balance sheets for restructuring charges.
21510_13_ITEM15_P78_S1	The table sets forth an analysis of the components of the restructuring charges and payments and other deductions made against the accrual for fiscal 2012 and 2011 (in thousands):
21510_13_ITEM15_P79_S0	The fiscal 2011 severance related costs were primarily comprised of severance pay, outplacement services, medical and other related benefits for employees being terminated due to the transition of activities out of Tampere, Finland.
21510_13_ITEM15_P79_S1	At September 29, 2012 and September 28, 2013 , there were no remaining accrued restructuring costs.

21510_13_ITEM15_P82_S0	Our allocation of the purchase price is as follows (in thousands):
21510_13_ITEM15_P83_S0	Results of operations for the business have been included in our consolidated financial statements subsequent to the date of acquisition and pro forma results of operations in accordance with authoritative guidance for prior periods have not been presented because the effect of the acquisition was not material to our prior period consolidated financial results.
21510_13_ITEM15_P84_S0	None of the goodwill from this purchase is deductible for tax purposes.
21510_13_ITEM15_P85_S0	The identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over their respective useful lives o f less than one to six years.
21510_13_ITEM15_P86_S0	In-process research and development ( IPR D ) consists of two projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility.
21510_13_ITEM15_P86_S1	Acquired IPR D assets are initially recognized at fair value and are classified as indefinite-lived assets until the successful completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts.
21510_13_ITEM15_P86_S2	The value assigned to IPR D was determined by considering the value of the products under development to the overall development plan, estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows to their present value.
21510_13_ITEM15_P86_S3	During the development period, these assets will not be amortized as charges to earnings; instead these assets will be subject to periodic impairment testing.
21510_13_ITEM15_P86_S4	Upon successful completion of the development process for the acquired IPR D projects, the assets would then be considered finite-lived intangible assets and amortization of the assets will commence.
21510_13_ITEM15_P86_S5	The projects have not been completed as of September 28, 2013 .
21510_13_ITEM15_P87_S0	We expensed $0.6 million of acquisition-related costs as selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations for our fiscal year 2013, and expensed $0.3 million of acquisition-related costs as selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations for our fiscal year 2012.

21510_13_ITEM15_P105_S1	Hypertronics has been included in our Specialty Lasers and Systems segment.
21510_13_ITEM15_P106_S0	Our allocation of the purchase price is as follows (in thousands):
21510_13_ITEM15_P107_S0	The goodwill recognized from this acquisition resulted primarily from anticipated revenue growth and synergies of integrating Hypertronics scan vision technology and system capabilities with our laser technology and global sales, marketing, distribution and service network.
21510_13_ITEM15_P107_S1	The goodwill was included in our Specialty Lasers and Systems segment.
21510_13_ITEM15_P108_S0	None of the goodwill from this purchase is deductible for tax purposes.
21510_13_ITEM15_P109_S0	The identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over their respective useful lives of two to six years.
21510_13_ITEM15_P110_S0	In-process research and development ( IPR D ) consisted of seven interrelated projects to be incorporated into one product and had not yet reached technological feasibility at the time of purchase.
21510_13_ITEM15_P111_S0	During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we determined that one of the hardware projects classified as IPR D acquired from Hypertronics would not be completed.
21510_13_ITEM15_P111_S1	As a result, $0.2 million was expensed in the second fiscal quarter for that project.
21510_13_ITEM15_P112_S0	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we decided to no longer pursue orders of Hypertronics' legacy products and thus determined that an impairment review of the intangible assets was required.
21510_13_ITEM15_P112_S1	As a result of our analysis, we determined that the intangible assets were fully impaired and that the remaining hardware projects classified as IPR D acquired from Hypertronics would not be completed.
21510_13_ITEM15_P112_S2	As a result, we recorded a $4.0 million charge in amortization expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.
21510_13_ITEM15_P112_S3	We also wrote off $0.3 million of inventory unique to these products that were not expected to be resold.
21510_13_ITEM15_P113_S0	We expensed $0.6 million of acquisition-related costs as selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations in the fiscal year ended October 1, 2011.
21510_13_ITEM15_P114_S0	Results of operations for the business have been included in our consolidated financial statements subsequent to the date of acquisition and pro forma results of operations in accordance with authoritative guidance for prior periods have not been presented because the effect of the acquisition was not material to our prior period consolidated financial results.
21510_13_ITEM15_P115_S0	We measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value.
21510_13_ITEM15_P116_S0	Level 1 valuations are obtained from real-time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets.
21510_13_ITEM15_P116_S1	Level 2 valuations are obtained from quoted market prices in active markets involving similar assets; these instruments, which mature within one year and are issued by counterparties with high credit ratings, include U.S. Treasury and international government obligations, investment-grade corporate bonds, certificates of deposit and commercial paper.
21510_13_ITEM15_P116_S2	Level 3 valuations would be based on unobservable inputs to a valuation model and include our own data about assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available under the circumstances; as of September 28, 2013 and September 29, 2012 , we did not have any assets or liabilities valued based on Level 3 valuations.

21510_13_ITEM15_P123_S2	Securities traded on a national exchange are stated at the last reported sales price on the day of valuation; other securities traded in over-the-counter market and listed securities for which no sale was reported on that date are stated as the last quoted bid price.
21510_13_ITEM15_P124_S0	SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS We consider all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.
21510_13_ITEM15_P124_S1	Investments classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of related income taxes, recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive income ("OCI") in stockholders' equity until realized.

21510_13_ITEM15_P128_S1	We enter into foreign exchange forwards to minimize the risks of foreign currency fluctuation of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet; these are not designated as hedging instruments.
21510_13_ITEM15_P128_S2	Our derivative contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features and do not require collateral or other security to be furnished by us or the counterparties.

21510_13_ITEM15_P129_S5	We utilize derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts with maturities of three months or less, to manage our exposure associated with anticipated cash flows and net asset and liability positions denominated in foreign currencies.
21510_13_ITEM15_P129_S6	Gains and losses on the forward contracts are mitigated by gains and losses on the underlying instruments.
21510_13_ITEM15_P130_S0	We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
21510_13_ITEM15_P130_S1	If a financial counterparty to any of our hedging arrangements experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge, we may experience material financial losses.
21510_13_ITEM15_P131_S0	For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense).

21510_13_ITEM15_P134_S1	We perform our annual impairment tests during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter, with any resulting impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.
21510_13_ITEM15_P135_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination.
21510_13_ITEM15_P135_S1	In September 2011, the FASB amended its guidance to simplify testing goodwill for impairment, allowing an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.
21510_13_ITEM15_P135_S2	If an entity determines as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not ( 50% likelihood) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative test is required.
21510_13_ITEM15_P135_S3	Otherwise, no further testing is required.
21510_13_ITEM15_P135_S4	Moreover, an entity can bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the impairment test, and then resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period.
21510_13_ITEM15_P135_S5	We adopted this accounting guidance for our impairment testing in fiscal 2012.
21510_13_ITEM15_P136_S0	Coherent has two reporting units: Specialty Laser Systems and Commercial Lasers and Components.
21510_13_ITEM15_P137_S0	fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying amount.
21510_13_ITEM15_P137_S1	In assessing the qualitative factors, we considered the impact of these key factors: macroeconomic conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency, market and industry conditions, our operating and competitive environment, regulatory and political developments, the overall financial performance of our reporting units including cost factors and budgeted-to-actual revenue results.
21510_13_ITEM15_P137_S2	We also considered market capitalization and stock price performance.
21510_13_ITEM15_P137_S3	Based on our assessment, goodwill in the reporting units was not impaired as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.
21510_13_ITEM15_P137_S4	As such, it was not necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test at that time.
21510_13_ITEM15_P138_S0	In fiscal 2013, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test.
21510_13_ITEM15_P138_S1	This election was made because we had last performed this impairment test in fiscal 2010 and we have subsequently added a substantial amount of goodwill balances as a result of our acquisitions of Midaz in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and the acquisitions of Innolight and Lumera in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.
21510_13_ITEM15_P138_S2	We performed our Step 1 test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and noted no impairment.
21510_13_ITEM15_P138_S3	We determined the fair value of our reporting units for the Step 1 test using a 50-50% weighting of the Income (discounted cash flow) approach and Market (market comparable) approach.
21510_13_ITEM15_P138_S4	Management completed and reviewed the results of the Step 1 analysis and concluded that a Step 2 analysis was not required as the estimated fair values of both of our reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values.
21510_13_ITEM15_P138_S5	Between the completion of that testing and the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we noted no indications of impairment or triggering events to cause us to review goodwill for potential impairment.
21510_13_ITEM15_P139_S0	The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment for fiscal 2013 and 2012 are as follows (in thousands):
21510_13_ITEM15_P140_S0	(1) Gross amount of goodwill for our CLC segment was $25.7 million at September 28, 2013 and September 29, 2012.
21510_13_ITEM15_P140_S1	For both periods, the accumulated impairment loss for the CLC segment was $19.3 million reflecting an impairment charge in fiscal 2009.
21510_13_ITEM15_P140_S2	(2) The gross amount of goodwill for our SLS segment was $109.4 million and $73.7 million at September 28, 2013 and September 29, 2012.
21510_13_ITEM15_P140_S3	For both periods, the accumulated impairment loss for the SLS segment was $2.4 million reflecting an impairment charge in fiscal 2003.
21510_13_ITEM15_P141_S0	We evaluate long-lived assets and amortizable intangible assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances or our planned use of assets indicate that their carrying amounts may not be fully recoverable or that their useful lives are no longer appropriate.
21510_13_ITEM15_P141_S1	Reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying values of assets are impaired based on comparison to the undiscounted expected future cash flows identifiable to such long-lived and amortizable intangible assets.
21510_13_ITEM15_P141_S2	If the comparison indicates that impairment exists, the impaired asset is written down to its fair value.
21510_13_ITEM15_P142_S0	During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we determined that one of the hardware projects classified as in-process research and development ("IPR D") acquired from Hypertronics would not be completed.
21510_13_ITEM15_P142_S1	As a result, $0.2 million was included in research and development expense in the second fiscal quarter for that project.
21510_13_ITEM15_P143_S0	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we decided to no longer pursue orders of Hypertronics legacy products and determined that the carrying amounts of the amortizable intangible assets, including the remaining IPR D, acquired from Hypertronics may not be recoverable and thus determined that an impairment review of the intangible assets was required.
21510_13_ITEM15_P143_S1	As a result of our analysis, we determined that the intangible assets were fully impaired and that the remaining hardware projects classified as in-process research and development ("IPR D") acquired from Hypertronics would not be completed.
21510_13_ITEM15_P143_S2	As a result, we recorded a $4.0 million charge in amortization expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.

21510_13_ITEM15_P179_S0	The market-based performance restricted stock unit award grants are generally either subject to annual vesting over three years from the date of grant or subject to a single vest measurement three years from the date of grant, depending upon achievement of performance measurements ("Performance RSUs") based on the performance of the Company's Total Shareholder Returns (as defined) compared with the performance of the Russell 2000 Index.
21510_13_ITEM15_P179_S1	The Company previously granted Performance RSUs during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 which had a single vesting measurement date of November 14, 2010.
21510_13_ITEM15_P179_S2	These RSUs would have vested anywhere between 0% and 300% of the targeted amount based upon achievement by the Company of (a) an annual revenue threshold amount and (b) adjusted EBITDA percentage targets.
21510_13_ITEM15_P179_S3	The Company determined that the performance target had not been met and these awards were canceled in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 with no shares vesting.
21510_13_ITEM15_P180_S0	We recognize compensation expense for all share-based payment awards based on the fair value of such awards.
21510_13_ITEM15_P180_S1	The expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective requisite service period of the awards.
21510_13_ITEM15_P181_S0	Determining Fair Value Stock Options Valuation and amortization method We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing formula and a single option award approach.
21510_13_ITEM15_P181_S1	This fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period.
21510_13_ITEM15_P181_S2	The expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and was determined based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock-based awards, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior as influenced by changes to the terms of its stock-based awards.
21510_13_ITEM15_P181_S3	Our process for computing expected volatility considers both historical volatility and market-based implied volatility; however our estimate of expected forfeitures is based on historical employee data and could differ from actual forfeitures.
21510_13_ITEM15_P182_S0	The risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation method is based on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term.

21510_13_ITEM15_P186_S2	The performance stock unit agreements provide for the award of performance stock units with each unit representing the right to receive one share of Coherent, Inc. common stock to be issued after the applicable award period.
21510_13_ITEM15_P186_S3	The final number of units awarded for this grant will be determined as of the vesting dates, based upon our total shareholder return over the performance period compared to the Russell 2000 Index and could range from a minimum of no units to a maximum of twice the initial award.
21510_13_ITEM15_P186_S4	The weighted average fair value for these performance units was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model incorporating the following weighted average assumptions:
21510_13_ITEM15_P187_S0	We recognize the estimated cost of these awards, as determined under the simulation model, over the related service period, with no adjustment in future periods based upon the actual shareholder return over the performance period.

21510_13_ITEM15_P205_S0	The tax holiday is conditional upon our meeting certain revenue, business spending and employment thresholds.
21510_13_ITEM15_P205_S1	Although Coherent Singapore had income in fiscal 2013, this amount was offset by a loss carryforward from fiscal 2012 and therefore we did not realize a benefit for the Singapore tax holiday in fiscal years 2013 and 2012.

21510_13_ITEM15_P208_S0	In determining our fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 tax provisions under ASC Subtopic 740, "Income Taxes", we calculated the deferred tax assets and liabilities for each separate tax entity.
21510_13_ITEM15_P208_S1	We then considered a number of factors including the positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of our deferred tax assets to determine whether a valuation allowance should be recognized with respect to our deferred tax assets.
21510_13_ITEM15_P208_S2	We determined that a valuation allowance was appropriate for a portion of the deferred tax assets of our California research and development tax credits, foreign tax attributes and net operating losses and capital loss carryforwards at fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 year-ends.
21510_13_ITEM15_P208_S3	During fiscal 2013 , we increased our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets to $13.4 million , primarily due to the reduced ability to utilize California research and development tax credits.
21510_13_ITEM15_P209_S0	The net deferred tax asset is classified on the consolidated balance sheets as follows (in thousands):
21510_13_ITEM15_P210_S0	We have various tax attribute carryforwards which include the following:

21510_13_ITEM15_P217_S3	Accordingly, prior year research and development tax credits of approximately $1.4 million less appropriate reserves were recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2013.
21510_13_ITEM15_P218_S0	We are subject to taxation and file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions.

21510_13_ITEM15_P218_S2	In our major foreign jurisdictions and our major state jurisdictions, the years prior to 2006 and 2009, respectively, are closed to examination.
21510_13_ITEM15_P218_S3	Earlier years in our various jurisdictions may remain open for adjustment to the extent that we have tax attribute carryforwards from those years.
21510_13_ITEM15_P218_S4	We believe that we have provided adequate reserves for any adjustments that may be determined by the tax authorities.
21510_13_ITEM15_P218_S5	As of September 28, 2013 , the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits including gross interest and penalties was $23.2 million , of which $17.9 million , if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate.

21510_13_ITEM15_P223_S0	SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION We are organized into two reportable operating segments: Specialty Lasers and Systems ("SLS") and Commercial Lasers and Components ("CLC").
21510_13_ITEM15_P224_S0	This segmentation reflects the go-to-market strategies for various products and markets.
21510_13_ITEM15_P224_S1	While both segments work to deliver cost-effective solutions, SLS develops and manufacturers configurable, advanced-performance products largely serving the microelectronics, scientific research and government programs and OEM components and instrumentation markets.
21510_13_ITEM15_P224_S2	The size and complexity of many of our SLS products require service to be performed at the customer site by factory-trained field service engineers.
21510_13_ITEM15_P225_S0	CLC focuses on higher volume products that are offered in set configurations.
21510_13_ITEM15_P225_S1	The product architectures are designed for easy exchange at the point of use such that product service and repairs are based upon advanced replacement and depot (i.e., factory) repair.
21510_13_ITEM15_P226_S0	CLC's primary markets include materials processing, OEM components and instrumentation and microelectronics.
21510_13_ITEM15_P227_S0	We have identified SLS and CLC as operating segments for which discrete financial information is available.
21510_13_ITEM15_P227_S1	Both units have dedicated engineering, manufacturing, product business management and product line management functions.
21510_13_ITEM15_P228_S0	A small portion of our outside revenue is attributable to projects and recently developed products for which a segment has not yet been determined.
21510_13_ITEM15_P229_S0	The associated direct and indirect costs are presented in the category of Corporate and other, along with other corporate costs as described below.
21510_13_ITEM15_P230_S0	Our Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the chief operating decision maker (CODM) as he assesses the performance of the segments and decides how to allocate resources to the segments.
21510_13_ITEM15_P230_S1	Income (loss) from operations is the measure of profit and loss that our CODM uses to assess performance and make decisions.
21510_13_ITEM15_P230_S2	As assets are not a measure used to assess the performance of the company by the CODM, asset information is not tracked or compiled by segment and is not available to be reported in our disclosures.
21510_13_ITEM15_P231_S0	We do not allocate to our operating segments certain operating expenses which we manage separately at the corporate level.
21510_13_ITEM15_P231_S1	These unallocated costs include stock-based compensation and corporate functions (certain research and development, management, finance, legal and human resources) and are included in the results below under Corporate and other in the reconciliation of operating results.

21510_13_ITEM15_P242_S0	The Company hereby grants to the Employee an award of Restricted Stock Units ( RSUs ), as set forth in the Notice of Grant, subject to the terms and conditions in this Agreement and in the Company's 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan ).
21510_13_ITEM15_P242_S1	Initially capitalized terms herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Plan or as defined herein, as applicable.
21510_13_ITEM15_P243_S0	Each RSU represents the right to receive a Share on the vesting date.
21510_13_ITEM15_P243_S1	Unless and until the RSUs vest, the Employee will have no right to receive Shares under such RSUs.
21510_13_ITEM15_P243_S2	Prior to actual distribution of Shares pursuant to any vested RSUs, such RSUs will represent an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable (if at all) only from the general assets of the Company.
21510_13_ITEM15_P244_S0	Vesting Schedule; Assumption or Substitution Calculation .
21510_13_ITEM15_P244_S1	The RSUs shall vest as follows:
21510_13_ITEM15_P245_S0	Up to the Maximum Amount will vest and be settled, based upon the extent, if any, to which the performance metric has been achieved.
21510_13_ITEM15_P246_S0	The performance metric is the relative performance of Company stock against the Russell 2000 index over a three-year period, with the target Company stock performance equivalent to the performance of the Russell 2000 index over such period.
21510_13_ITEM15_P246_S1	To determine relative performance, the baseline metrics are the 90 trading day average closing price of the Company and the Russell 2000 Index, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, or such other reliable source as is determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion, with the last of the 90 trading days falling on November 14, 2012.
21510_13_ITEM15_P246_S2	This 90 day average establishes both the Company baseline stock price (the Company Baseline Stock Price ) and the Russell 2000 Index baseline (the Russell 2000 Baseline ) against which future Company stock and Russell 2000 Index performance will be compared.
21510_13_ITEM15_P247_S0	Next, the Company will measure the 90 trading day average closing price of the Company and the Russell 2000 Index, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, or such other reliable source as is determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion, with the last trading day of such 90-trading day period ending on November 13, 2015 (establishing both the Company Closing Price and the Russell 2000 Index Closing Price ).
21510_13_ITEM15_P248_S0	The Company will then measure Company performance by dividing the Company Closing Price by the Company Baseline Stock Price, with the quotient expressed as a percentage of the Company Baseline Stock Price (the Company Percentage Performance ).
21510_13_ITEM15_P248_S1	The Company will then measure Russell 2000 Index Performance over the same period by dividing the Russell 2000 Index Closing Price by the Russell 2000 Index Baseline with the quotient expressed as a percentage of the Russell 2000 Index Baseline (the Russell 2000 Index Percentage Performance ).
21510_13_ITEM15_P249_S0	The Company will then subtract the Russell 2000 Index Percentage Performance from the Company Percentage Performance, then add 100 to the result, with the final result constituting the relative Company performance as a percentage (the Relative Performance Percentage ).
21510_13_ITEM15_P250_S0	If the Relative Performance Percentage is 50% or less, no RSUs shall vest.
21510_13_ITEM15_P250_S1	If the Relative Performance Percentage equals 51%, then 2% of the Target Amount shall vest.
21510_13_ITEM15_P250_S2	If the Relative Performance Percentage equals 70%, then 40% of the Target Amount shall vest.
21510_13_ITEM15_P250_S3	If the Relative Performance Percentage equals 100%, then the Target Amount shall vest.
21510_13_ITEM15_P250_S4	If the Relative Performance Percentage equals 150% or more, then 200% of the Target Amount shall vest (i.e., the Maximum Amount shall vest).
21510_13_ITEM15_P250_S5	Relative Performance Percentages shall result in incremental vesting on a straight-line basis within tiers based on full percentage Relative Performance Percentages as set forth below:
21510_13_ITEM15_P251_S0	The Company Closing Price shall be automatically adjusted to account for any Company stock split or similar change in capitalization effected without receipt of consideration by the Company set forth in Plan Section 19(a) in the same manner as set forth in Plan Section 19(a).
21510_13_ITEM15_P251_S1	In making determinations of the number of Shares that vest hereunder, all Relative Performance Percentage fractional percentages and Share numbers below .5 shall be rounded down to the nearest whole percentage or Share number, respectively and all Relative Performance Percentage fractional percentages and Share numbers of .5 or greater shall be rounded up to the nearest whole percentage or Share number, respectively.

21510_14_ITEM1_P0_S0	Business Overview Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30.
21510_14_ITEM1_P0_S1	Fiscal years 2014 , 2013 and 2012 ended on September 27 , September 28 , and September 29 , respectively, and are referred to in this annual report as fiscal 2014 , fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 for convenience.
21510_14_ITEM1_P0_S2	Fiscal years 2014 , 2013 and 2012 included 52 weeks.
21510_14_ITEM1_P1_S0	We are one of the world's leading suppliers of photonics-based solutions in a broad range of commercial and scientific research applications.
21510_14_ITEM1_P1_S1	We design, manufacture, service and market lasers and related accessories for a diverse group of customers.
21510_14_ITEM1_P1_S2	Since inception in 1966, we have grown through internal expansion and through strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies, intellectual property, manufacturing processes and product offerings.
21510_14_ITEM1_P1_S3	We are organized into two operating segments: Specialty Lasers and Systems ("SLS") and Commercial Lasers and Components ("CLC").
21510_14_ITEM1_P1_S4	This segmentation reflects the go-to-market strategies for various products and markets.
21510_14_ITEM1_P1_S5	While both segments deliver cost-effective photonics solutions, SLS develops and manufactures configurable, advanced performance products largely serving the microelectronics, scientific research and government programs and OEM components and instrumentation markets.
21510_14_ITEM1_P1_S6	The size and complexity of many of the SLS products require service to be performed at the customer site by factory-trained field service engineers.
21510_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	CLC focuses on higher volume products that are offered in set configurations.
21510_14_ITEM1_P2_S1	The product architectures are designed for easy exchange at the point of use such that substantially all product service and repairs are based upon advanced replacement and depot (i.e., factory) repair.
21510_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	CLC's primary markets include materials processing, original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") components and instrumentation and microelectronics.
21510_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	Income (loss) from operations is the measure of profit and loss that our chief operating decision maker ("CODM") uses to assess performance and make decisions.
21510_14_ITEM1_P4_S1	Income (loss) from operations represents the sales less the cost of sales and direct operating expenses incurred within the operating segments as well as allocated expenses such as shared sales and manufacturing costs.
21510_14_ITEM1_P4_S2	We do not allocate to our operating segments certain operating expenses, which we manage separately at the corporate level.
21510_14_ITEM1_P4_S3	These unallocated costs include stock-based compensation and corporate functions (certain advanced research and development, management, finance, legal and human resources) and are included in Corporate and other.
21510_14_ITEM1_P4_S4	Management does not consider unallocated Corporate and other costs in its measurement of segment performance.
21510_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	We were originally incorporated in California on May 26, 1966 and reincorporated in Delaware on October 1, 1990.
21510_14_ITEM1_P5_S1	Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and we are a member of the Standard Poor's SmallCap 600 Index and the Russell 2000 Index.
21510_14_ITEM1_P5_S2	Additional information about Coherent, Inc. (referred to herein as the Company, we, our, or Coherent) is available on our web site at www.coherent.com.
21510_14_ITEM1_P5_S3	We make available, free of charge on our web site, access to our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as soon as reasonably practicable after we file or furnish them electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").
21510_14_ITEM1_P5_S4	Information contained on our web site is not part of this annual report or our other filings with the SEC.
21510_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	Any product, product name, process, or technology described in these materials is the property of Coherent.
21510_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	A laser emits an intense coherent beam of light with some unique and highly useful properties.
21510_14_ITEM1_P7_S1	Most importantly, a laser is orders of magnitude brighter than any lamp.
21510_14_ITEM1_P7_S2	As a result of its coherence, the beam can be focused to a very small and intense spot, useful for applications requiring very high power densities including cutting and other materials processing procedures.
21510_14_ITEM1_P7_S3	The laser's high spatial resolution is also useful for microscopic imaging and inspection applications.
21510_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	Laser light can be monochromatic all the beam energy is confined to a narrow wavelength band.
21510_14_ITEM1_P8_S1	Some lasers can be used to create ultrafast output a series of pulses with pulse durations as short as attoseconds (i.e., 10 -18 seconds).
21510_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	There are many types of lasers and one way of classifying them is by the material or medium used to create the lasing action.
21510_14_ITEM1_P9_S1	This can be in the form of a gas, liquid, semiconductor, solid state crystal or fiber.
21510_14_ITEM1_P9_S2	Lasers can also be classified by their output wavelength: ultraviolet, visible, infrared or wavelength tunable.
21510_14_ITEM1_P9_S3	We manufacture all of these laser types.
21510_14_ITEM1_P9_S4	There are also many options in terms of pulsed output versus continuous wave, pulse duration, output power, beam dimensions, etc.
21510_14_ITEM1_P9_S5	In fact, each application has its specific requirements in terms of laser performance.
21510_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	to offer a diverse set of product lines characterized by lasers targeted at growth opportunities and key applications.
21510_14_ITEM1_P10_S1	In all cases, we aim to be the supplier of choice by offering a high-value combination of superior technical performance and high reliability.
21510_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	Photonics has taken its place alongside electronics as a critical enabling technology for the twenty-first century.
21510_14_ITEM1_P11_S1	Photonics based solutions are entrenched in a broad array of industries that include industrial automation, textile processing, microelectronics, flat panel displays and medical diagnostics, with adoption continuing in ever more diverse applications.
21510_14_ITEM1_P11_S2	Growth in these applications stems from two sources.
21510_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	First, there are many applications where the laser is displacing conventional technology because it can do the job faster, better or more economically.
21510_14_ITEM1_P12_S1	Second, there are new applications where the laser is the enabling tool that makes the work possible (e.g., the production of sub 50 micron microvias); these lasers are used in the manufacturing of high density printed circuit boards ("PCBs") found in the latest smart phones and tablet computers.
21510_14_ITEM1_P12_S2	Key laser applications include: semiconductor inspection; manufacturing of advanced PCBs; flat panel display manufacturing; solar cell production; medical and bio-instrumentation; materials processing; industrial process and quality control; marking; imaging and printing; graphic arts and display; and, research and development.
21510_14_ITEM1_P12_S3	For example, ultraviolet ( UV ) lasers are enabling the move towards miniaturization, which drives innovation and growth in many markets.
21510_14_ITEM1_P12_S4	In addition, the advent of industrial grade ultrafast lasers continues to open up new applications for laser processing.
21510_14_ITEM1_P12_S5	We strive to develop innovative and proprietary products and solutions that meet the needs of our customers and that are based on our core expertise in lasers and optical technologies.
21510_14_ITEM1_P12_S6	In pursuit of our strategy, we intend to:

21510_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	Focus on long-term improvement of adjusted EBITDA, in dollars and as a percentage of net sales We define adjusted EBITDA as operating income adjusted for depreciation, amortization, stock compensation expenses, major restructuring costs and certain other non-operating income and expense items.
21510_14_ITEM1_P18_S1	Key initiatives to reach our goals for EBITDA improvements include utilization of our Asian manufacturing locations, rationalizing our supply chain and continued leveraging of our infrastructure.
21510_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	APPLICATIONS Our products address a broad range of applications that we group into the following markets: Microelectronics, Materials Processing, OEM Components and Instrumentation and Scientific Research and Government Programs.
21510_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	Microelectronics Nowhere is the trend towards miniaturization more prevalent than in the Microelectronics market where smart phones, tablets, ultrabooks, personal computers ("PC's"), televisions ("TV's") and now "wearables" are driving advances in displays, integrated circuits and PCBs.
21510_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	In response to market demands and expectations, semiconductor and device manufacturers are continually seeking to improve their process and design technologies in order to manufacture smaller, more powerful and more reliable devices at lower cost.
21510_14_ITEM1_P21_S1	New laser applications and new laser technologies are a key element in delivering higher resolution and higher precision at lower manufacturing cost.
21510_14_ITEM1_P21_S2	We support three major markets in the microelectronics industry: (1) flat panel display ("FPDs") manufacturing, (2) advanced packaging and interconnects and (3) semiconductor front-end.
21510_14_ITEM1_P21_S3	Microelectronics flat panel display manufacturing The high-volume consumer market is driving the production of FPDs in applications such as mobile phones, tablets, ultrabooks, laptop computers, TVs and wearables.
21510_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	There are several types of established and emerging displays based on quite different technologies, including liquid crystal ("LCD") and organic polymers ("OLED").
21510_14_ITEM1_P22_S1	Each of these technologies utilize laser applications due to the fact that lasers enable higher process speed, better yield, improved battery life, lower cost and/or superior display brightness and resolution.
21510_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	Several display types require a high-density pattern of silicon thin film transistors ("TFTs").
21510_14_ITEM1_P23_S1	If this silicon is polycrystalline, the display performance is greatly enhanced.
21510_14_ITEM1_P23_S2	In the past, these polysilicon layers could only be produced on expensive special glass at high temperatures.
21510_14_ITEM1_P23_S3	However, excimer-based processes, such as excimer laser annealing ("ELA") have allowed high-volume production of low-temperature polysilicon ("LTPS") on conventional glass substrates.
21510_14_ITEM1_P23_S4	Our excimer lasers provide an invaluable solution for LTPS because they are the only industrial-grade excimer lasers with the high pulse energy optimized for this application.
21510_14_ITEM1_P23_S5	The current state-of-the-art product for this application is our excimer VYPER laser, which delivers over 1000W of power, enabling customers to scale to current Generation 5 5.5 substrates all the way up to Generation 8 sizes.
21510_14_ITEM1_P23_S6	These systems are integral to the manufacturing process on all leading LTPS-based smart phone displays, with the highest commercially available pixel densities of greater than 300 pixels per inch (ppi), with the current trends going to even higher ppi for high end smart phones, and hold the potential for deployment in tablet display and OLED TV manufacturing.
21510_14_ITEM1_P23_S7	Our AVIA, Rapid, Talisker and DIAMOND lasers are also used in other production processes for FPDs.
21510_14_ITEM1_P23_S8	These processes include drilling, cutting, patterning, marking and yield improvement.
21510_14_ITEM1_P23_S9	Microelectronics advanced packaging and interconnects After a wafer is patterned, there are then a host of other processes, referred to as back-end processing, which finally result in a packaged encapsulated silicon chip.
21510_14_ITEM1_P23_S10	Ultimately, these chips are then assembled into finished products.
21510_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	The advent of high-speed logic and high-memory content devices has caused chip manufacturers to look for alternative technologies to improve performance and lower process costs.
21510_14_ITEM1_P24_S1	In terms of materials, this search includes new types of materials, such as low-k and thinner silicon.
21510_14_ITEM1_P24_S2	Our AVIA, Rapid, Talisker and Matrix lasers provide economical methods of cutting and scribing these wafers while delivering higher yields than traditional mechanical methods.
21510_14_ITEM1_P24_S3	There are similar trends in chip packaging and PCB manufacturing requiring more compact packaging and denser interconnects.
21510_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	In many cases, lasers present enabling technologies.
21510_14_ITEM1_P25_S1	For instance, lasers are now the only economically practical method for drilling microvias in chip substrates and in both rigid and flexible PCBs.
21510_14_ITEM1_P25_S2	These microvias are tiny interconnects that are essential for enabling high-density circuitry commonly used in smart phones, tablets and advanced computing systems.
21510_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	Our DIAMOND carbon dioxide ("CO 2 ") and AVIA diode pumped solid state ("DPSS") lasers are the lasers of choice in this application.
21510_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	The ability of these lasers to operate at very high repetition rates translates into faster drilling speeds and increased throughput in microvia processing applications.
21510_14_ITEM1_P26_S2	In addition, multi-layer circuit boards require more flexible production methods than conventional printing technologies can offer, which has led to widespread adoption of laser direct imaging ("LDI").
21510_14_ITEM1_P26_S3	Our Paladin laser is used for this application.
21510_14_ITEM1_P26_S4	Lasers have also become a valuable tool in high-brightness ("HB") LED manufacturing, improving LED performance and yield.
21510_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	LEDs have widespread adoption as the light source in all categories of LCD displays, from phones all the way to full size TVs and moving into general lighting.
21510_14_ITEM1_P27_S1	Our lasers are used in back-end processing of HB-LEDs.
21510_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	Microelectronics semiconductor front-end The term "front-end" refers to the production of semiconductor devices which occurs prior to packaging.
21510_14_ITEM1_P28_S1	As semiconductor device geometries decrease in size, devices become increasingly susceptible to smaller defects during each phase of the manufacturing process and these defects can negatively impact yield.
21510_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	One of the semiconductor industry's responses to the increasing vulnerability of semiconductor devices to smaller defects has been to use defect detection and inspection techniques that are closely linked to the manufacturing process.
21510_14_ITEM1_P29_S1	For example, automated laser-based inspection systems are now used to detect and locate defects as small as 0.01 micron, which may not be observable by conventional optical microscopes.
21510_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	Detecting the presence of defects is only the first step in preventing their recurrence.
21510_14_ITEM1_P30_S1	After detection, defects must be examined in order to identify their size, shape and the process step in which the defect occurred.
21510_14_ITEM1_P30_S2	This examination is called defect classification.
21510_14_ITEM1_P30_S3	Identification of the sources of defects in the lengthy and complex semiconductor manufacturing process has become essential for maintaining high yield production.
21510_14_ITEM1_P30_S4	Semiconductor manufacturing has become an around-the-clock operation and it is important for products used for inspection, measurement and testing to be reliable and to have long lifetimes.
21510_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	Our Azure, Paladin and Excimer lasers are used to detect and characterize defects in semiconductor chips.
21510_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	Materials processing Lasers are widely accepted today in many important industrial manufacturing applications including cutting, welding, joining, drilling, perforating, and marking of metals and nonmetals.

21510_14_ITEM1_P33_S2	Operating costs, due to a combination of input power efficiencies and the sealed nature of the DIAMOND series of CO2 lasers, are 50% less than similar, but larger tools.
21510_14_ITEM1_P33_S3	We also participate in the low to medium power area, including such applications as the cutting, drilling and joining of a host of materials using our DIAMOND CO 2 lasers; Highlight fiber array product ("FAP") semiconductor lasers in OEM opportunities and direct end user applications with META cutting tools; applications including cutting, perforating and scoring of paper, thin metals and packaging materials; and various cutting and patterning applications in the textile, wood and sign industries.
21510_14_ITEM1_P33_S4	In the specific area of textiles and clothing, our DIAMOND lasers service older applications, such as cutting complex shapes in leather for footwear, as well as newer applications such as creating detailed fade patterns on designer denims.
21510_14_ITEM1_P33_S5	Laser marking and coding are generally considered part of the precision materials processing applications market for which we remain a leading supplier.
21510_14_ITEM1_P33_S6	The optimum choice of laser depends on the material being marked, whether it is a surface mark (engraved) or a sub-surface mark, and the specific economics of the application.
21510_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	Our DIAMOND J, C and GEM Series of CO 2 lasers provide many systems manufacturers with a reliable cost effective source for marking and engraving on non-metals.
21510_14_ITEM1_P34_S1	In addition, our Matrix and Helios product lines of reliable, compact and low-cost DPSS lasers provide an ideal solution for marking of other materials in high volume manufacturing.

21510_14_ITEM1_P38_S3	We also provide ultrafast lasers for use in cataract surgery, a growing applications space.
21510_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	The unique ability of our optically pumped semiconductor lasers ("OPSL") technology to match a wavelength to an application has led to the development of a high-power yellow (577nm) laser for the treatment of eye related diseases, such as Age Related Macular Degeneration and retinal diseases associated with diabetes.
21510_14_ITEM1_P39_S1	The 577nm wavelength was designed to match the peak in absorption of oxygenated hemoglobin thereby allowing treatment to occur at a lower power level, and thus reducing stress and heat-load placed on the eye with traditional green-based (530nm) solid state lasers.
21510_14_ITEM1_P39_S2	Other applications where our OBIS, Genesis and Sapphire series of lasers are used include the retinal scanning market in diagnostic imaging systems as well as new ground breaking in-vivo imaging.

21510_14_ITEM1_P40_S4	We have a large installed base of scientific lasers which are used in a wide range of applications spanning virtually every branch of science and engineering.
21510_14_ITEM1_P40_S5	These applications include biology and life science, engineering, physical chemistry and physics.
21510_14_ITEM1_P40_S6	Most of these applications require the use of ultrafast lasers that enable the generation of pulses short enough to be measured in femto- or attoseconds (10 -15 to 10 -18 seconds).
21510_14_ITEM1_P40_S7	Because of these very short pulse durations, ultrafast lasers enable the study of fundamental physical and chemical processes with temporal resolution unachievable with any other tool.
21510_14_ITEM1_P40_S8	These lasers also deliver very high peak power and large bandwidths, which can be used to generate many exotic effects.
21510_14_ITEM1_P40_S9	Some of these are now finding their way into mainstream applications, such as microscopy or materials processing.
21510_14_ITEM1_P40_S10	The use of ultrafast lasers such as the Chameleon in microscopy is now a common occurrence in bio-imaging labs, and they have become a crucial tool in modern brain research.
21510_14_ITEM1_P40_S11	We recently released a new product called the Fidelity targeted to this market.
21510_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	FUTURE TRENDS Microelectronics Lasers are widely used in mass production microelectronics applications largely because they enable entirely new application capabilities that cannot be realized by any other known means.
21510_14_ITEM1_P41_S1	These laser-based fabrication and testing methods provide a level of precision, typically on a micrometer and nanometer level, that are unique, faster, are touch free, deliver superior end products, increase yields, and/or cut production costs.
21510_14_ITEM1_P41_S2	We anticipate this trend to continue, driven primarily by the increasing sophistication and miniaturization of consumer electronic goods and their convergence via the internet, resulting in increasing demand for better displays, more bandwidth and memory, and all packaged into devices which are lighter, thinner and consume less power.
21510_14_ITEM1_P41_S3	Although this market follows the macro-economic trends and carries inherent risks, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to capitalize on the current market trends and that we will see continued increased adoption of our solid-state, CO 2 , fiber, direct diode and excimer lasers, as all these lasers enable entirely new applications, performance improvements and reduced process costs.
21510_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	LTPS-based high resolution mobile displays (greater than 300ppi), and especially the emergence of OLED technology, is evolving as the prevalent FPD technology.
21510_14_ITEM1_P42_S1	We believe we are well positioned, especially with our Vyper Excimer lasers and LB optical systems, to take advantage of this trend, including flexible OLED displays.
21510_14_ITEM1_P42_S2	CO 2 , Avia, Matrix, Rapid, Talisker, Helios and direct diode lasers all seem aligned with the need for related FPD touch panel, film cutting, light guide technology, repair, frit welding, as well as sapphire and glass-cutting applications.
21510_14_ITEM1_P43_S0	The trend for thinner and lighter devices is impacting the glass substrates used in today s mobile devices requiring thinner glass with higher degrees of mechanical strength and scratch resistance.
21510_14_ITEM1_P43_S1	This trend also includes use of sapphire instead of glass.
21510_14_ITEM1_P43_S2	Mechanical means of cutting these glass and sapphire pieces are no longer adequate to meet future requirements and we expect lasers to play an increased role.
21510_14_ITEM1_P43_S3	Our CO 2 and Rapid lasers are well positioned to take advantage of this trend.
21510_14_ITEM1_P43_S4	Semiconductor devices look set to continue Moore's Law, shrinking device geometries for at least another decade, as well as expanding vertically into new 3D structures.
21510_14_ITEM1_P43_S5	As a result we believe our many UV laser sources (such as Azure, Paladin, Avia, Rapid, ExiStar and Matrix) will continue to find increasing adoption, since their unique optical properties align well with the process demands of a nanometer scale world.
21510_14_ITEM1_P43_S6	The same lasers plus CO 2 are also widely adopted for back end Advanced Packaging and Interconnect (API) applications.
21510_14_ITEM1_P43_S7	With dimension roadmaps showing a decade of dimension shrink on PCBs, interconnects, Silicon LED scribe widths and wafer thickness, we believe that our portfolio of lasers aligns well with these demands as well as new processes that seem likely to be enabled by our lasers, to meet the increasing demands and decreasing tolerances of these markets.
21510_14_ITEM1_P44_S0	Materials processing The market for low to medium power CO 2 , solid state and semiconductor lasers used in industrial materials processing is very diverse.
21510_14_ITEM1_P44_S1	New product introductions such as our Diamond J-series and key design wins continue to support our growth in this area.
21510_14_ITEM1_P45_S0	These lasers represent a cost-effective manufacturing solution for cutting, joining, marking and engraving of non-metal materials including marking/coding, flat bed cutting, engraving, as well as the production of capital equipment for apparel and leather goods manufacturing.
21510_14_ITEM1_P46_S0	The market for kW class fiber lasers has seen strong growth in recent years, replacing legacy multi-kW CO 2 lasers in metal cutting and other applications.
21510_14_ITEM1_P46_S1	This trend will likely continue into the future.
21510_14_ITEM1_P47_S0	The favorable cost of ownership of high power diode and fiber lasers has expanded their use in a number of metal processing applications in addition to cutting.
21510_14_ITEM1_P47_S1	They have seen adoption in welding and brazing applications as well as newer growth areas in additive manufacturing like cladding and 3D printing.
21510_14_ITEM1_P47_S2	We believe we are well positioned to benefit from these large and growing markets with our line of kW fiber and diode lasers.
21510_14_ITEM1_P47_S3	Our four-pronged approach to the higher power industrial laser market provides us with a unique combination of high power, precision and compact size, which we believe will be highly desirable in existing manufacturing environments as well as those of the future.

21510_14_ITEM1_P49_S0	In this field, our OPSL technology gives us truly differentiated products at a number of important wavelengths.
21510_14_ITEM1_P49_S1	This advantage coupled with strong focus on meeting our customers demands for more compact and cost effective sources has made us very successful and we expect that to continue.
21510_14_ITEM1_P49_S2	Our OPSL technology resulted in the first truly continuous wave solid-state UV laser which enables the use of UV in a clinical as well as a research environment.
21510_14_ITEM1_P50_S0	In the medical therapeutic area, we see solid business with several opportunities for growth.

21510_14_ITEM1_P60_S2	They are also less affected by environmental changes in temperature and humidity, which can alter alignment and inhibit performance in many systems.
21510_14_ITEM1_P61_S0	We manufacture a variety of types of DPSS lasers for different applications including semiconductor inspection; advanced packaging and interconnects; laser pumping; spectroscopy; bio-agent detection; DNA sequencing; drug discovery; flow cytometry; forensics; computer-to-plate printing; entertainment lighting (display); medical; rapid prototyping and marking, welding, engraving, cutting and drilling.
21510_14_ITEM1_P62_S0	Fiber lasers Fiber lasers use semiconductor lasers to pump a doped optical fiber to produce a laser beam.
21510_14_ITEM1_P62_S1	The unique features of a fiber laser make them suitable for producing high power, continuous wave laser beams.
21510_14_ITEM1_P62_S2	We have introduced a 1 kilowatt fiber laser and we plan to introduce multi-kilowatt fiber lasers in fiscal 2015.
21510_14_ITEM1_P62_S3	Our fiber laser design has several unique features including a modular design for improved serviceability and diode bar based pumping.
21510_14_ITEM1_P62_S4	Due to packaging efficiency, diode bars reduce the overall cost of a fiber laser.
21510_14_ITEM1_P63_S0	Some of the most critical components inside a fiber laser include the gain fiber itself and the diodes providing the pump power.
21510_14_ITEM1_P63_S1	We are well positioned as a fiber laser supplier since we are vertically integrated with respect to these key technologies; we use diode bars and fiber manufactured in-house.
21510_14_ITEM1_P63_S2	We plan to continue to drive cost reduction in our diode laser pumps and demonstrate the scalability of the platform by moving up the power scale into the multi kilowatt regime.
21510_14_ITEM1_P63_S3	This platform will address the large growing high power metal cutting and joining market.
21510_14_ITEM1_P64_S0	Gas lasers (CO 2 , Excimer, Ion) The breadth of our gas laser portfolio is industry leading, encompassing CO 2 , excimer and ion laser technologies.
21510_14_ITEM1_P65_S0	Gas lasers derive their name from the use of one or more gases as a lasing medium.
21510_14_ITEM1_P65_S1	They collectively span an extremely diverse and useful emission range, from the very deep ultraviolet to the far infrared.
21510_14_ITEM1_P65_S2	This diverse range of available wavelengths, coupled with high optical output power, and an abundance of other attractive characteristics, makes gas lasers extremely useful and popular for a variety of microelectronics, scientific, medical therapeutic and materials processing applications.
21510_14_ITEM1_P66_S0	Our OPSL platform is a surface emitting semiconductor laser that is energized or pumped by a semiconductor laser.
21510_14_ITEM1_P66_S1	The use of optical pumping circumvents inherent power scaling limitations of electrically pumped lasers, enabling very high powered devices.
21510_14_ITEM1_P66_S2	A wide range of wavelengths can be achieved by varying the semiconductor materials used in the device and changing the frequency of the laser beam using techniques common in solid state lasers.
21510_14_ITEM1_P66_S3	The platform leverages high reliability technologies developed for telecommunications and produces a compact, rugged, high power, single-mode laser.
21510_14_ITEM1_P66_S4	Our OPSL products are well suited to a wide range of applications, including the bio-instrumentation, medical therapeutics and graphic arts and display markets.
21510_14_ITEM1_P66_S5	We have expanded our offerings in the area of entertainment lighting using a variety of products across the visible spectrum and we also continue to expand our ultraviolet version of the OPSL platform called the Genesis, which was developed for the bio-instrumentation market.
21510_14_ITEM1_P67_S0	Semiconductor lasers High power edge emitting semiconductor diode lasers use the same principles as widely-used CD and DVD lasers, but produce significantly higher power levels.
21510_14_ITEM1_P67_S1	The advantages of this type of laser include smaller size, longer life, enhanced reliability and greater efficiency.
21510_14_ITEM1_P68_S0	We manufacture a wide range of discrete semiconductor laser products with wavelengths ranging from 650nm to over 1000nm and output powers ranging from 1W to over 100W, with highly integrated products in the kW range.
21510_14_ITEM1_P68_S1	These products are available in a variety of industry standard form factors including the following: bare die, packaged and fiber coupled single emitters and bars, monolithic stacks and fully integrated modules with microprocessor controlled units that contain power supplies and active coolers.
21510_14_ITEM1_P69_S0	Our semiconductor lasers are used internally as the pump lasers in DPSS, fiber and OPSL products that are manufactured by us, as well as a wide variety of external medical, OEM, military and industrial applications, including aesthetic (hair removal, cosmetic dentistry), graphic arts, counter measures, rangefinders, target designators, cladding, hardening and plastic welding.
21510_14_ITEM1_P70_S0	Lasers Ultrafast lasers are lasers generating light pulses with durations of a few femtoseconds (10 -15 seconds) to a few tens of picoseconds (10 -11 seconds).
21510_14_ITEM1_P70_S1	These types of lasers are used for medical, advanced microelectronics and materials processing applications as well as scientific research.
21510_14_ITEM1_P70_S2	UF laser oscillators generate a train of pulses at 50-100 MHz, with peak powers of tens of kilowatts, and UF laser amplifiers generate pulses at 1-2000 kHz, with peak powers up to several Terawatts.
21510_14_ITEM1_P70_S3	The extremely short duration of UF laser pulses enables temporally resolving fast events like the dynamics of atoms or electrons.
21510_14_ITEM1_P70_S4	In addition, the high peak power enables so-called non-linear effects where several photons can be absorbed by a molecule at the same time.
21510_14_ITEM1_P70_S5	This type of process enables applications like multi-photon excitation microscopy or UF ablation of materials with high precision and minimal thermal damage.
21510_14_ITEM1_P71_S0	SALES AND MARKETING We primarily market our products in the United States through a direct sales force.
21510_14_ITEM1_P71_S1	Our foreign sales are made principally to customers in South Korea, Japan, Germany, China and other European and Asia-Pacific countries.

21510_14_ITEM1_P75_S0	We work closely with customers, both individually and through our sponsored seminars, to develop products to meet customer application and performance needs.
21510_14_ITEM1_P75_S1	In addition, we are working with leading research and educational institutions to develop new photonics based solutions.
21510_14_ITEM1_P76_S0	MANUFACTURING Strategies One of our core manufacturing strategies is to tightly control our supply of key parts, components, sub-assemblies and outsourcing partners.
21510_14_ITEM1_P76_S1	We primarily utilize vertical integration when we have proprietary internal capabilities that are not cost-effectively available from external sources.
21510_14_ITEM1_P76_S2	We believe this is essential to maintain high quality products and enable rapid development and deployment of new products and technologies.
21510_14_ITEM1_P76_S3	We provide customers with 24-hour technical expertise and quality that is International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") certified at our principal manufacturing sites.
21510_14_ITEM1_P76_S4	Committed to quality and customer satisfaction, we design and produce many of our own components and sub-assemblies in order to retain quality and performance control.
21510_14_ITEM1_P76_S5	We have also outsourced certain components, sub-assemblies and finished goods where we can maintain our high quality standards while improving our cost structure.
21510_14_ITEM1_P76_S6	As part of our strategy to increase our market share and customer support in Asia as well as our continuing efforts to manage costs, we have transferred the production of additional products into both the Singapore and Malaysia factories.
21510_14_ITEM1_P76_S7	In addition, we expanded our repair activities in our China operation.
21510_14_ITEM1_P76_S8	This has allowed us to reduce service response time and inventories, providing benefits to us and to our customers.
21510_14_ITEM1_P76_S9	We have also established an International Procurement Office in Singapore and have started to increase our sourcing of materials from Asia to reduce material costs on a global basis.
21510_14_ITEM1_P76_S10	In fiscal 2012, we opened a tube refurbishment manufacturing site in South Korea to better service our customers in that region.
21510_14_ITEM1_P76_S11	In fiscal 2013, we expanded our manufacturing presence in Germany through the acquisitions of Innolight and Lumera.
21510_14_ITEM1_P77_S0	We have designed and implemented proprietary manufacturing tools, equipment and techniques in an effort to provide products that differentiate us from our competitors.
21510_14_ITEM1_P77_S1	These proprietary manufacturing techniques are utilized in a number of our product lines including our gas laser production, crystal growth, beam alignment as well as the wafer growth for our semiconductor and optically pumped semiconductor laser product family.
21510_14_ITEM1_P78_S0	Raw materials or sub-components required in the manufacturing process are generally available from several sources.
21510_14_ITEM1_P78_S1	However, we currently purchase several key components and materials, including exotic materials, crystals and optics, used in the manufacture of our products from sole source or limited source suppliers.
21510_14_ITEM1_P78_S2	We also purchase assemblies and turnkey solutions from contract manufacturers based on our proprietary designs.

21510_14_ITEM1_P79_S0	INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights.
21510_14_ITEM1_P79_S1	As of September 27, 2014 , we held approximately 427 U.S. and foreign patents, which expire from 2014 through 2032 (depending on the payment of maintenance fees) and we have approximately 147 additional pending patent applications that have been filed.
21510_14_ITEM1_P79_S2	The issued patents cover various products in all of the major markets that we serve.
21510_14_ITEM1_P80_S0	For a discussion of the importance to our business of, and the risks attendant to intellectual property rights, see "Risk Factors" in Item 1A "We may not be able to protect our proprietary technology which could adversely affect our competitive advantage" and "We may, in the future, be subject to claims or litigation from third parties, for claims of infringement of their proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of competitors or other rights holders.
21510_14_ITEM1_P80_S1	These claims could result in costly litigation and the diversion of our technical and management personnel.
21510_14_ITEM1_P81_S0	COMPETITION Competition in the various photonics markets in which we provide products is very intense.
21510_14_ITEM1_P81_S1	We compete against a number of companies including CVI Melles Griot, GSI Group, Inc., IPG Photonics Corporation, JDS Uniphase Corporation, Newport Corporation, Rofin-Sinar Technologies, Inc., Trumpf GmbH, as well as other smaller companies.
21510_14_ITEM1_P81_S2	We compete globally based on our broad product offering, reliability, cost, and performance advantages for the widest range of commercial and scientific research applications.
21510_14_ITEM1_P81_S3	Other considerations by our customers include warranty, global service and support and distribution.
21510_14_ITEM1_P81_S4	At fiscal 2014 year-end, our backlog of orders scheduled for shipment (within one year) was $328.3 million compared to $285.8 million at fiscal 2013 year-end.
21510_14_ITEM1_P81_S5	By segment, backlog for SLS was $253.0 million and $204.7 million, respectively, at fiscal 2014 and 2013 year-ends.
21510_14_ITEM1_P81_S6	Backlog for CLC was $75.3 million and $81.1 million, respectively, at fiscal 2014 and 2013 year-ends.
21510_14_ITEM1_P81_S7	The increase in SLS backlog from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014 year-end is primarily due to timing of large excimer laser annealing orders for the flat panel display market, which explains the increase in overall company backlog as well.
21510_14_ITEM1_P82_S0	Orders used to compute backlog are generally cancelable without substantial penalties.
21510_14_ITEM1_P83_S0	Historically, the rate of cancellation experienced by us has not been significant though we cannot guarantee that cancellations will not increase in the future.
21510_14_ITEM1_P83_S1	We have historically experienced decreased bookings and revenue in the first fiscal quarter compared to other quarters in our fiscal year due to the impact of time off and business closures at our facilities and those of many of our customers due to year-end holidays.
21510_14_ITEM1_P83_S2	For example over the past 10 years we have noted, excluding certain recovery years, our first fiscal quarter revenues have ranged 2%-12% below the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal years.
21510_14_ITEM1_P83_S3	This historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's future net sales or financial performance.
21510_14_ITEM1_P84_S0	As of fiscal 2014 year-end, we had 2,519 employees.
21510_14_ITEM1_P84_S1	Approximately 399 of our employees are involved in research and development; 1,526 of our employees are involved in operations, manufacturing, service and quality assurance; and 594 of our employees are involved in sales, order administration, marketing, finance, information technology, general management and other administrative functions.
21510_14_ITEM1_P84_S2	Our success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain employees.
21510_14_ITEM1_P84_S3	We face competition in this regard from other companies, research and academic institutions, government entities and other organizations.
21510_14_ITEM1_P84_S4	We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
21510_14_ITEM1_P85_S0	(Kaiserslautern, Germany) ("Lumera") for approximately $51.5 million , excluding transaction costs.
21510_14_ITEM1_P86_S0	Lumera manufactures ultrafast solid state lasers for microelectronics, OEM medical and materials processing applications.
21510_14_ITEM1_P86_S1	Lumera has been included in our Specialty Lasers and Systems segment.
21510_14_ITEM1_P87_S0	In October 2012, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Innolight Innovative Laser and Systemtechnik GmbH ("Innolight") for approximately $18.3 million, excluding transaction costs.

21510_14_ITEM1_P87_S2	Its semiconductor-based architecture delivers pulsed output that can be amplified by conventional or fiber amplifiers to ultimately deliver infrared, green or ultraviolet light capable of processing a range of materials.
21510_14_ITEM1_P87_S3	Innolight has been included in our Specialty Lasers and Systems segment.
21510_14_ITEM1_P88_S0	In July 2012, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of MiDAZ Lasers Ltd for approximately $3.8 million in cash.
21510_14_ITEM1_P88_S1	We intend to utilize th e acquired technology in low cost, compact pulsed solid state lasers.
21510_14_ITEM1_P88_S2	MiDAZ has been included in our Specialty Lasers and Systems segment.
21510_14_ITEM1_P88_S3	Business Combinations" of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of this annual report for further discussion of recent acquisitions completed.
21510_14_ITEM1_P89_S0	Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, handling and disposal of regulated materials, chemicals, various radioactive materials and certain waste products.
21510_14_ITEM1_P89_S1	In the United States, we are subject to the federal regulation and control of the Environmental Protection Agency.
21510_14_ITEM1_P89_S2	Comparable authorities are involved in other countries.
21510_14_ITEM1_P89_S3	Such rules are subject to change by the governing agency and we monitor those changes closely.
21510_14_ITEM1_P89_S4	We expect all operations to meet the legal and regulatory environmental requirements and believe that compliance with those regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive and financial position.
21510_14_ITEM1_P89_S5	Although we believe that our safety procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of such materials comply with the standards required by federal and state laws and regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials.
21510_14_ITEM1_P89_S6	In the event of such an accident involving such materials, we could be liable for damages and such liability could exceed the amount of our liability insurance coverage and the resources of our business.
21510_14_ITEM1_P90_S0	We may face potentially increasing complexity in our product designs and procurement operations due to the evolving nature of product compliance standards.
21510_14_ITEM1_P90_S1	Those standards may impact the material composition of our products entering specific markets.
21510_14_ITEM1_P90_S2	Such regulations went into effect in the European Union ("EU") in 2006, and China in 2007.
21510_14_ITEM1_P91_S0	We could face significant costs and liabilities in connection with product take-back legislation.
21510_14_ITEM1_P92_S0	Beginning in 2006, the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive made producers of electrical goods financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products.
21510_14_ITEM1_P92_S1	In addition, the EU has added the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals Regulation, otherwise known as the REACH Regulation, which further regulates substances and products imported, manufactured or sold within the EU.
21510_14_ITEM1_P92_S2	Similar laws are now pending in various jurisdictions around the world, including the United States.
21510_14_ITEM1_P93_S0	Our operations are subject to various laws and regulations governing the environment, including the discharge of pollutants and the management and disposal of hazardous substances.
21510_14_ITEM1_P93_S1	As a result of our historic as well as on-going operations, we could incur substantial costs, including remediation costs.
21510_14_ITEM1_P93_S2	The costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to predict.
21510_14_ITEM1_P93_S3	Our accruals for such costs and liabilities may not be adequate because the estimates on which the accruals are based depend on a number of factors including the nature of the matter, the complexity of the site, site geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) at multi-party sites and the number and financial viability of other PRPs.
21510_14_ITEM1_P94_S0	We are organized into two operating segments: Specialty Lasers and Systems ("SLS") and Commercial Lasers and Components ("CLC").
21510_14_ITEM1_P94_S1	This segmentation reflects the go-to-market strategies for various products and markets.
21510_14_ITEM1_P95_S0	SLS develops and manufacturers configurable, advanced-performance products largely serving the microelectronics, scientific research and government programs and OEM components and instrumentation markets.
21510_14_ITEM1_P95_S1	The size and complexity of many of the SLS products require service to be performed at the customer site by factory-trained field service engineers.
21510_14_ITEM1_P95_S2	While both segments work to deliver cost-effective photonics solutions, CLC focuses on higher volume products that are offered in set configurations.
21510_14_ITEM1_P95_S3	The product architectures are designed for easy exchange at the point of use such that product service and repairs are based upon advanced replacement and depot (i.e., factory) repair.
21510_14_ITEM1_P96_S0	CLC's primary markets include materials processing, OEM components and instrumentation and microelectronics.
21510_14_ITEM1_P97_S0	We have identified SLS and CLC as operating segments for which discrete financial information was available.
21510_14_ITEM1_P97_S1	Both units have dedicated engineering, manufacturing, product business management and product line management functions.
21510_14_ITEM1_P98_S0	The associated direct and indirect costs are presented in the category of Corporate and other, along with other corporate costs.
21510_14_ITEM1_P99_S0	FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND EXPORT SALES Financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations for fiscal years 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , is set forth in Note 15, "Segment and Geographic Information" of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of this annual report.

21510_14_ITEM1A_P0_S2	These risks are not exclusive, and additional risks to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, the factors mentioned under Forward-Looking Statements and the risk of our businesses described elsewhere in this annual report.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Additionally, these risks and uncertainties described herein are not the only ones facing us.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our operating results, including net sales, net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA in dollars and as a percentage of net sales, as well as our stock price have varied in the past, and our future operating results will continue to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations based upon numerous factors, including those discussed in this Item 1A and throughout this report.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our stock price will continue to be subject to daily variations as well.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Our future operating results and stock price may not follow any past trends or meet our guidance and expectations.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our net sales and operating results, such as adjusted EBITDA percentage, net income (loss) and operating expenses, and our stock price have varied in the past and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year in the future.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We believe a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, could cause these variations and make them difficult to predict, including:
21510_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	distraction of management related to acquisition or divestment activities.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In addition, we often recognize a substantial portion of our sales in the last month of our fiscal quarters.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	impact of the shortfall on our operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We also base our manufacturing on our forecasted product mix for the quarter.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If the actual product mix varies significantly from our forecast, we may not be able to fill some orders during that quarter, which would result in delays in the shipment of our products.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Accordingly, variations in timing of sales, particularly for our higher priced, higher margin products, can cause significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Due to these and other factors, such as varying product mix, we believe that quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year comparisons of our historical operating results may not be meaningful.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	You should not rely on our results for any quarter or year as an indication of our future performance.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Our operating results in future quarters and years may be below public market analysts' or investors' expectations, which would likely cause the price of our stock to fall.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P6_S3	In addition, over the past several years, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the stock prices of many technology companies both in and outside our industry.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P6_S4	There has not always been a direct correlation between this volatility and the performance of particular companies subject to these stock price fluctuations.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Further, over the last twelve months, equity markets around the world have significantly fluctuated across most sectors.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P6_S6	These factors, as well as general economic and political conditions or investors' concerns regarding the credibility of corporate financial statements, may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our stock in the future.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We depend on sole source or limited source suppliers, both internal and external, for some of our key components and materials, including exotic materials, certain cutting-edge optics and crystals, in our products, which make us susceptible to supply shortages or price fluctuations that could adversely affect our business.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We currently purchase several key components and materials used in the manufacture of our products from sole source or limited source suppliers, both internal and external.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Our failure to timely receive these key components and materials, such as the large optics used in our flat panel display manufacturing applications, could cause delays in the shipment of our products.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Some of these suppliers are relatively small private companies that may discontinue their operations at any time and which may be particularly susceptible to prevailing economic conditions.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Some of our suppliers are located in regions which may be susceptible to natural disasters, such as the flooding in Thailand and the earthquake, tsunami and resulting nuclear disaster in Japan and severe flooding and power loss in the Eastern part of the United States in recent years.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P8_S4	We typically purchase our components and materials through purchase orders or agreed upon terms and conditions and we do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with many of these suppliers.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Some of our products, particularly in the flat panel display industry, require designs and specifications which are at the cutting-edge of available technologies.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P8_S6	Our and our customers' designs and specifications frequently change to meet rapidly evolving market demands.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P8_S7	Accordingly certain of our products require components and supplies which may be technologically difficult and unpredictable to manufacture.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P8_S8	These characteristics further pressure the timely delivery of such components.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P8_S9	We may fail to obtain these supplies in a timely manner in the future.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P8_S10	We may experience difficulty identifying alternative sources of supply for certain components used in our products and may have to incur expenses and management distraction in assisting our current and future suppliers to meet our and our customers' technical requirements.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P8_S11	We would experience further delays while identifying, evaluating and testing the products of these potential alternative suppliers.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P8_S12	Furthermore, financial or other difficulties faced by these suppliers or significant changes in demand for these components or materials could limit their availability.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P8_S13	We continue to consolidate our supply base and move supplier locations.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P8_S14	When we transition locations we may increase our inventory of such products as a safety stock during the transition, which may cause the amount of inventory reflected on our balance sheet to increase.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P8_S15	Additionally, many of our customers rely on sole source suppliers.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P8_S16	In the event of a disruption of our customers' supply chain, orders from our customers could decrease or be delayed.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these components or materials, or the inability to obtain these components and materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time, or our failure to properly manage these moves, would impair our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and could cause customers to cancel orders.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We have historically relied exclusively on our own production capability to manufacture certain strategic components, crystals, semiconductor lasers, lasers and laser-based systems.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Because we manufacture, package and test these components, products and systems at our own facilities, and such components, products and systems are not readily available from other sources, any interruption in manufacturing would adversely affect our business.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P10_S2	In addition, our failure to achieve adequate manufacturing yields of these items at our manufacturing facilities may materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We participate in the microelectronics market, which requires significant research and development expenses to develop and maintain products and a failure to achieve market acceptance for our products could have a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The microelectronics market is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product introductions, the volatility of product supply and demand, changing customer requirements and evolving industry standards.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The nature of this market requires significant research and development expenses to participate, with substantial resources invested in advance of material sales of our products to our customers in this market.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Additionally, our product offerings may become obsolete given the frequent introduction of alternative technologies.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P12_S3	In the event either our customers' or our products fail to gain market acceptance, or the microelectronics market fails to grow, it would likely have a significant negative effect on our business and results of operations.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We participate in the flat panel display market, which has a relatively limited number of end customer manufacturers.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Our backlog, timing of net sales and results of operations could be negatively impacted in the event our customers reschedule orders.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	In the flat panel display market, there are a relatively limited number of manufacturers who are the end customers for our annealing products.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	In each of our last three fiscal years, Advanced Process Systems Corporation, an integrator in the flat panel display market, has contributed more than 10% of our revenue.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Given macroeconomic conditions, varying consumer demand and technical process limitations at manufacturers, our customers may seek to reschedule or cancel orders.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Challenges in meeting evolving technological requirements for these complex products by us and our suppliers could also result in delays in shipments, rescheduled or canceled orders by our customers.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P14_S4	This could negatively impact our backlog, timing of net sales and results of operations.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	As of September 27, 2014, flat panel display systems represented 41% of our backlog.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Given our backlog includes these higher average selling price flat panel display systems, any delays or cancellation of shipments could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Some of our laser systems are complex in design and may contain defects that are not detected until deployed by our customers, which could increase our costs and reduce our net sales.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Lasers and laser systems are inherently complex in design and require ongoing regular maintenance.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The manufacture of our lasers, laser products and systems involves a highly complex and precise process.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	As a result of the technological complexity of our products, in particular the flat panel annealing systems, changes in our or our suppliers' manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective materials by us or our suppliers could result in a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and product reliability.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P17_S3	To the extent that we do not achieve and maintain our projected yields or product reliability, our business, operating results, financial condition and customer relationships would be adversely affected.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P17_S4	We provide warranties on a majority of our product sales, and reserves for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P17_S5	The determination of such reserves requires us to make estimates of failure rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P17_S6	We typically establish warranty reserves based on historical warranty costs for each product line.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P17_S7	If actual return rates and/or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates, adjustments to cost of sales may be required in future periods which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated under the end user's peak stress conditions.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P18_S1	In addition, some of our products are combined with products from other vendors, which may contain defects.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P18_S2	As a result, should problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P18_S3	If we are unable to identify and fix defects or other problems, we could experience, among other things:
21510_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	legal actions by our customers and/or their end users.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Continued volatility in the semiconductor manufacturing and advanced packaging markets could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	A portion of our net sales in the microelectronics market depends on the demand for our products by semiconductor equipment and advanced packaging applications companies.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	These markets have historically been characterized by sudden and severe cyclical variations in product supply and demand, which have often severely affected the demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment, including laser-based tools and systems.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P22_S2	The timing, severity and duration of these market cycles are difficult to predict, and we may not be able to respond effectively to these cycles.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P22_S3	The continuing uncertainty in these markets severely limits our ability to predict our business prospects or financial results in these markets.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	During industry downturns, our net sales from these markets may decline suddenly and significantly.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Our ability to rapidly and effectively reduce our cost structure in response to such downturns is limited by the fixed nature of many of our expenses in the near term and by our need to continue our investment in next-generation product technology and to support and service our products.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	In addition, due to the relatively long manufacturing lead times for some of the systems and subsystems we sell to these markets, we may incur expenditures or purchase raw materials or components for products we cannot sell.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Accordingly, downturns in the semiconductor capital equipment market may materially harm our operating results.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Conversely, when upturns in these markets occur, we must be able to rapidly and effectively increase our manufacturing capacity to meet increases in customer demand that may be extremely rapid, and if we fail to do so we may lose business to our competitors and our relationships with our customers may be harmed.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We are exposed to risks associated with worldwide economic conditions and related uncertainties which could negatively impact demand for our products and results of operations.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets, depressed consumer confidence, government economic policies, negative economic conditions, volatile corporate profits and reduced capital spending could negatively impact demand for our products.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P25_S1	In particular, it is difficult to develop and implement strategy, sustainable business models and efficient operations, as well as effectively manage supply chain relationships in the face of such conditions including uncertainty regarding the ability of some of our suppliers to continue operations and provide us with uninterrupted supply flow.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Our ability to maintain our research and development investments in our broad product offerings may be adversely impacted in the event that our sales decline and do not increase in the future.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Spending and the timing thereof by consumers and businesses have a significant impact on our results and, where such spending is delayed or canceled, it could have a material negative impact on our operating results.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The current global economic conditions remain uncertain and challenging.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Weakness in our end markets could negatively impact our net sales, gross margin and operating expenses, and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Recent uncertainty in global fiscal policy has likely had an adverse impact on global financial markets and overall economic activity.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Should this uncertain financial policy recur, it would likely negatively impact global economic activity.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Any weakness in global economies would also likely have negative repercussions on U.S. and global credit and financial markets, and further exacerbate sovereign debt concerns in the European Union.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P27_S3	All of these factors would likely adversely impact the global demand for our products and the performance of our investments, and would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The financial turmoil which recently affected the banking system and financial markets continues to negatively impact financial institutions and has resulted in tighter credit markets, and lower levels of liquidity in some financial markets.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	There could be a number of follow-on effects from the tightened credit environment on our business, including the insolvency of key suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and/or manufacture products resulting in product delays; inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and/or customer insolvencies; and failure of financial institutions negatively impacting our treasury functions.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P28_S2	In the event our customers are unable to obtain credit or otherwise pay for our shipped products it could significantly impact our ability to collect on our outstanding accounts receivable.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments; impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments; interest rates; cash balances; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Volatility in the financial markets and any overall economic uncertainty increase the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Uncertainty about current global economic conditions could also continue to increase the volatility of our stock price.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	In addition, political and social turmoil related to international conflicts, terrorist acts and civil unrest may put further pressure on economic conditions in the United States and abroad.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	difficult for our customers, our suppliers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P30_S1	If such conditions persist, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Additionally, unstable economic conditions can provide significant pressures and burdens on individuals, which could cause them to engage in inappropriate business conduct.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P30_S3	See Part II, Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are managed through various banks around the world and volatility in the capital and credit market conditions could cause financial institutions to fail or materially harm service levels provided by such banks, both of which could have an adverse impact on our ability to timely access funds.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	World capital and credit markets have been and may continue to experience volatility and disruption.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P32_S1	In some cases, the markets have exerted downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers, as well as pressured the solvency of some financial institutions.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P32_S2	These financial institutions, including banks, have had difficulty timely performing regular services and in some cases have failed or otherwise been largely taken over by governments.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We maintain our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments with a number of financial institutions around the world.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Should some or all of these financial institutions fail or otherwise be unable to timely perform requested services, we would likely have a limited ability to timely access our cash deposited with such institutions, or, in extreme circumstances the failure of such institutions could cause us to be unable to access cash for the foreseeable future.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P33_S2	If we are unable to quickly access our funds when we need them, we may need to increase the use of our existing credit lines or access more expensive credit, if available.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P33_S3	If we are unable to access our cash or if we access existing or additional credit or are unable to access additional credit, it could have a negative impact on our operations, including our reported net income.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We are exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Although we have not recognized any material losses on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, future declines in their market values could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Given the global nature of our business, we have investments both domestically and internationally.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	There has recently been growing pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, particularly in Europe where a significant portion of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are invested, which results in corresponding pressure on the valuation of the securities issued by such nations.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Additionally, our overall investment portfolio is often concentrated in certificates of deposit and money market funds.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P37_S2	We maintain a mix of government-issued securities.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P37_S3	Credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, financial results, or other factors.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P37_S4	Additionally, liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations could result in decreased values for our investments in certain government securities.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P37_S5	As a result, the value or liquidity of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments could decline or become materially impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P37_S6	See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to increase our sales volumes and decrease our costs to offset potential declines in the average selling prices ( ASPs ) of our products and, if we are unable to realize greater sales volumes and lower costs, our operating results may suffer.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our ability to increase our sales volume and our future success depends on the continued growth of the markets for lasers, laser systems and related accessories, as well as our ability to identify, in advance, emerging markets for laser-based systems.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P39_S1	We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify, on a timely basis, new high-growth markets in the future.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Moreover, we cannot assure you that new markets will develop for our products or our customers' products, or that our technology or pricing will enable such markets to develop.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Future demand for our products is uncertain and will depend to a great degree on continued technological development and the introduction of new or enhanced products.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P39_S4	If this does not continue, sales of our products may decline and our business will be harmed.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We have in the past experienced decreases in the ASPs of some of our products.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P40_S1	As competing products become more widely available, the ASPs of our products may decrease.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P40_S2	If we are unable to offset any decrease in our ASPs by increasing our sales volumes, our net sales will decline.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P40_S3	In addition, to maintain our gross margins, we must continue to reduce the cost of manufacturing our products while maintaining their high quality.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	From time to time, our products, like many complex technological products, may fail in greater frequency than anticipated.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P41_S1	This can lead to further charges, which can result in higher costs, lower gross margins and lower operating results.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Furthermore, as ASPs of our current products decline, we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements with higher margins.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P41_S3	If we cannot maintain our gross margins, our operating results could be seriously harmed, particularly if the ASPs of our products decrease significantly.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new and enhanced products that meet the needs of our customers.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our current products address a broad range of commercial and scientific research applications in the photonics markets.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We cannot assure you that the market for these applications will continue to generate significant or consistent demand for our products.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Demand for our products could be significantly diminished by disrupting technologies or products that replace them or render them obsolete.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Furthermore, the new and enhanced products in certain markets generally continue to be smaller in size and have lower ASPs, and therefore, we have to sell more units to maintain revenue levels.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P43_S4	Accordingly, we must continue to invest in research and development in order to develop competitive products.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to anticipate our customers' needs and develop products that address those needs.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Introduction of new products and product enhancements will require that we effectively transfer production processes from research and development to manufacturing and coordinate our efforts with those of our suppliers to achieve volume production rapidly.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P44_S2	If we fail to transfer production processes effectively, develop product enhancements or introduce new products in sufficient quantities to meet the needs of our customers as scheduled, our net sales may be reduced and our business may be harmed.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We face risks associated with our foreign operations and sales that could harm our financial condition and results of operations.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P46_S0	For fiscal 2014 , fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 , 74% , 77% and 76% , respectively, of our net sales were derived from customers outside of the United States.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P46_S1	We anticipate that foreign sales, particularly in Asia, will continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales in the foreseeable future.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P47_S0	A global economic slowdown or a natural disaster could have a negative effect on various foreign markets in which we operate, such as the earthquake, tsunami and resulting nuclear disaster in Japan and the flooding in Thailand in recent years.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Such a slowdown may cause us to reduce our presence in certain countries, which may negatively affect the overall level of business in such countries.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Our foreign sales are primarily through our direct sales force.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Additionally, some foreign sales are made through foreign distributors and resellers.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Our foreign operations and sales are subject to a number of risks, including:
21510_14_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Our business could also be impacted by international conflicts, terrorist and military activity, civil unrest and pandemic illness which could cause a slowdown in customer orders or cause customer order cancellations.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We are also subject to the risks of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, which could materially adversely affect the sales price of our products in foreign markets, as well as the costs and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P50_S1	While we use forward exchange contracts and other risk management techniques to hedge our foreign currency exposure, we remain exposed to the economic risks of foreign currency fluctuations.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We may not be able to protect our proprietary technology which could adversely affect our competitive advantage.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Maintenance of intellectual property rights and the protection thereof is important to our business.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P52_S1	We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Our patent applications may not be approved, any patents that may be issued may not sufficiently protect our intellectual property and any issued patents may be challenged by third parties.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P52_S3	Other parties may independently develop similar or competing technology or design around any patents that may be issued to us.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P52_S4	We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P52_S5	Further, we may be required to enforce our intellectual property or other proprietary rights through litigation, which, regardless of success, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management's attention.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P52_S6	Additionally, there may be existing patents of which we are unaware that could be pertinent to our business and it is not possible for us to know whether there are patent applications pending that our products might infringe upon since these applications are often not publicly available until a patent is issued or published.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We may, in the future, be subject to claims or litigation from third parties, for claims of infringement of their proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of competitors or other rights holders.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P53_S1	These claims could result in costly litigation and the diversion of our technical and management personnel.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Adverse resolution of litigation may harm our operating results or financial condition.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P54_S0	In recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States and around the world involving patents and other intellectual property rights.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P54_S1	This has been seen in our industry, for example in the recently concluded patent-related litigation between IMRA America, Inc. ("Imra") and IPG Photonics Corporation and in Imra's recently brought litigation against two of our German subsidiaries.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P55_S0	From time to time, like many other technology companies, we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights, copyrights, trademark rights or other intellectual property rights which such third parties believe may cover certain of our products, processes, technologies or information.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P55_S1	In the future, we may be a party to litigation to protect our intellectual property or as a result of an alleged infringement of others' intellectual property whether through direct claims or by way of indemnification claims of our customers, as, in some cases, we contractually agree to indemnify our customers against third-party infringement claims relating to our products.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P55_S2	These claims and any resulting lawsuit, if successful, could subject us to significant liability for damages or invalidation of our proprietary rights.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P55_S3	These lawsuits, regardless of their success, would likely be time-consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P55_S4	Any potential intellectual property litigation could also force us to do one or more of the following:
21510_14_ITEM1A_P56_S0	redesign the products that use the technology.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P57_S0	If we are forced to take any of these actions or are otherwise a party to lawsuits of this nature, we may incur significant losses and our business may be seriously harmed.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P57_S1	We do not have insurance to cover potential claims of this type.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P58_S0	If our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Factors that may be considered in determining whether a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable include declines in our stock price and market capitalization or future cash flows projections.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P59_S3	We recorded a charge during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 related to the impairment of intangibles in our SLS operating segment relating to the decision to discontinue the legacy Hypertronics products.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P60_S0	effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we used to calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units, could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an impairment charge.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Any such material charges, whether related to goodwill or purchased intangible assets, may have a material negative impact on our financial and operating results.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We depend on skilled personnel to operate our business effectively in a rapidly changing market, and if we are unable to retain existing or hire additional personnel when needed, our ability to develop and sell our products could be harmed.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel will be a critical factor in determining whether we will be successful in the future.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Recruiting and retaining highly skilled personnel in certain functions continues to be difficult.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P63_S1	At certain locations where we operate, the cost of living is extremely high and it may be difficult to retain key employees and management at a reasonable cost.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P63_S2	We may not be successful in attracting, assimilating or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P63_S3	Our failure to attract additional employees and retain our existing employees could adversely affect our growth and our business.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and support personnel, any of whom may leave, which could harm our business and our results of operations.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P65_S0	The long sales cycles for our products may cause us to incur significant expenses without offsetting net sales.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Customers often view the purchase of our products as a significant and strategic decision.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P66_S1	As a result, customers typically expend significant effort in evaluating, testing and qualifying our products before making a decision to purchase them, resulting in a lengthy initial sales cycle.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P66_S2	While our customers are evaluating our products and before they place an order with us, we may incur substantial sales and marketing and research and development expenses to customize our products to the customers' needs.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P66_S3	We may also expend significant management efforts, increase manufacturing capacity and order long lead-time components or materials prior to receiving an order.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P66_S4	Even after this evaluation process, a potential customer may not purchase our products.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P66_S5	As a result, these long sales cycles may cause us to incur significant expenses without ever receiving net sales to offset such expenses.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P67_S0	The markets in which we sell our products are intensely competitive and increased competition could cause reduced sales levels, reduced gross margins or the loss of market share.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Competition in the various photonics markets in which we provide products is very intense.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P68_S1	We compete against a number of large public and private companies, including CVI Melles Griot, GSI Group, Inc., IPG Photonics Corporation, JDS Uniphase Corporation, Newport Corporation, Rofin-Sinar Technologies, Inc., and Trumpf GmbH, as well as other smaller companies.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P68_S2	Some of our competitors are large companies that have significant financial, technical, marketing and other resources.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P68_S3	These competitors may be able to devote greater resources than we can to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P68_S4	Some of our competitors are much better positioned than we are to acquire other companies in order to gain new technologies or products that may displace our product lines.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P68_S5	Any of these acquisitions could give our competitors a strategic advantage.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P68_S6	Any business combinations or mergers among our competitors, forming larger companies with greater resources, could result in increased competition, price reductions, reduced margins or loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Additional competitors may enter the markets in which we serve, both foreign and domestic, and we are likely to compete with new companies in the future.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P69_S1	We may encounter potential customers that, due to existing relationships with our competitors, are committed to the products offered by these competitors.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P69_S2	Further, our current or potential customers may determine to develop and produce products for their own use which are competitive to our products.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P69_S3	As a result of the foregoing factors, we expect that competitive pressures may result in price reductions, reduced margins, loss of sales and loss of market share.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P69_S4	In addition, in markets where there are a limited number of customers, competition is particularly intense.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P70_S0	If we fail to accurately forecast component and material requirements for our products, we could incur additional costs and incur significant delays in shipments, which could result in a loss of customers.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P71_S0	We use rolling forecasts based on anticipated product orders and material requirements planning systems to determine our product requirements.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P71_S1	It is very important that we accurately predict both the demand for our products and the lead times required to obtain the necessary components and materials.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P71_S2	We depend on our suppliers for most of our product components and materials.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P71_S3	Lead times for components and materials that we order vary significantly and depend on factors including the specific supplier requirements, the size of the order, contract terms and current market demand for components.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P72_S0	increases in our sales levels of certain products, some of our suppliers may need at least nine months lead-time.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P72_S1	If we overestimate our component and material requirements, we may have excess inventory, which would increase our costs.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P72_S2	If we underestimate our component and material requirements, we may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt and delay delivery of our products to our customers.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P72_S3	Any of these occurrences would negatively impact our net sales, business or operating results.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Our increased reliance on contract manufacturing and other outsourcing may adversely impact our financial results and operations due to our decreased control over the performance and timing of certain aspects of our manufacturing.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Our manufacturing strategy includes partnering with contract manufacturers to outsource non-core subassemblies and less complex turnkey products, including some performed at international sites located in Asia and Eastern Europe.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Additionally, we have outsourced the manufacture of certain of our optics components to certain third parties.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P74_S2	Our ability to resume internal manufacturing operations for certain products and components in a timely manner may be eliminated.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P74_S3	The cost, quality, performance and availability of contract manufacturing operations are and will be essential to the successful production and sale of many of our products.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P74_S4	Our financial condition or results of operation could be adversely impacted if any contract manufacturer or other supplier is unable for any reason, including as a result of the impact of worldwide economic conditions, to meet our cost, quality, performance, and availability standards.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P74_S5	We may not be able to provide contract manufacturers with product volumes that are high enough to achieve sufficient cost savings.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P74_S6	If shipments fall below forecasted levels, we may incur increased costs or be required to take ownership of the inventory.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P74_S7	Also, our ability to control the quality of products produced by contract manufacturers may be limited and quality issues may not be resolved in a timely manner, which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P75_S0	If we fail to effectively manage our growth or, alternatively, our spending during downturns, our business could be disrupted, which could harm our operating results.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Growth in sales, combined with the challenges of managing geographically dispersed operations, can place a significant strain on our management systems and resources, and our anticipated growth in future operations could continue to place such a strain.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P76_S1	The failure to effectively manage our growth could disrupt our business and harm our operating results.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P76_S2	Our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in evolving markets requires an effective planning and management process.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P76_S3	In economic downturns, we must effectively manage our spending and operations to ensure our competitive position during the downturn, as well as our future opportunities when the economy improves, remain intact.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P76_S4	The failure to effectively manage our spending and operations could disrupt our business and harm our operating results.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Historically, acquisitions have been an important element of our strategy.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P77_S1	However, we may not find suitable acquisition candidates in the future and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P77_S2	Any acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P78_S0	We have in the past made strategic acquisitions of other corporations and entities, as well as asset purchases, and we continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions of complementary companies, products and technologies.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P78_S1	In the event of any future acquisitions, we could:
21510_14_ITEM1A_P79_S0	incur expenses related to impairment of goodwill and amortization.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Acquisitions also involve numerous risks, including:
21510_14_ITEM1A_P81_S0	the failure to complete acquisitions even after signing definitive agreements which, among other things, would result in the expensing of potentially significant professional fees and other charges in the period in which the acquisition or negotiations are terminated.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P82_S0	We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify appropriate acquisition candidates, to integrate any businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future or achieve the anticipated benefits of such transactions, which may harm our business.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P83_S0	We are exposed to lawsuits in the normal course of business which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P84_S0	We are exposed to lawsuits in the normal course of our business, including product liability claims, if personal injury, death or commercial losses occur from the use of our products.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P84_S1	While we typically maintain business insurance, including directors' and officers' policies, litigation can be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations, including the potential impact of indemnification obligations for individuals named in any such lawsuits.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P84_S2	We may not, however, be able to secure insurance coverage on terms acceptable to us in the future.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P84_S3	Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P84_S4	An unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit, including a recall or redesign of products if ultimately determined to be defective, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P85_S0	We use standard laboratory and manufacturing materials that could be considered hazardous and we could be liable for any damage or liability resulting from accidental environmental contamination or injury.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Although most of our products do not incorporate hazardous or toxic materials and chemicals, some of the gases used in our excimer lasers and some of the liquid dyes used in some of our scientific laser products are highly toxic.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P86_S1	In addition, our operations involve the use of standard laboratory and manufacturing materials that could be considered hazardous.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P86_S2	Also, if a facility fire were to occur at our Sunnyvale, California site and were to spread to a reactor used to grow semiconductor wafers, it could release highly toxic emissions.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P86_S3	We believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with all federal, state and offshore regulations and standards.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P86_S4	However, the risk of accidental environmental contamination or injury from such materials cannot be entirely eliminated.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P86_S5	In the event of such an accident involving such materials, we could be liable for damages and such liability could exceed the amount of our liability insurance coverage and the resources of our business which could have an adverse effect on our financial results or our business as a whole.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Compliance or the failure to comply with current and future environmental regulations could cause us significant expense.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P88_S0	We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process or requiring design changes or recycling of products we manufacture.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P88_S1	If we fail to comply with any present and future regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities, the suspension of production or a prohibition on the sale of products we manufacture.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P88_S2	In addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment, or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations, including expenses associated with the recall of any non-compliant product and the management of historical waste.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P89_S0	From time to time new regulations are enacted, and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P89_S1	We continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P90_S0	( RoHS ) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive ( WEEE ) enacted in the European Union which regulate the use of certain hazardous substances in, and require the collection, reuse and recycling of waste from, certain products we manufacture.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P90_S1	This and similar legislation that has been or is in the process of being enacted in Japan, China, Korea and various states of the United States may require us to re-design our products to ensure compliance with the applicable standards, for example by requiring the use of different types of materials.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P90_S2	These redesigns or alternative materials may detrimentally impact the performance of our products, add greater testing lead-times for product introductions or have other similar effects.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P90_S3	We believe we comply with all such legislation where our products are sold and we will continue to monitor these laws and the regulations being adopted under them to determine our responsibilities.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P90_S4	In addition, we are monitoring legislation relating to the reduction of carbon emissions from industrial operations to determine whether we may be required to incur any additional material costs or expenses associated with our operations.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P90_S5	We are not currently aware of any such material costs or expenses.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P91_S0	The SEC has promulgated rules requiring disclosure regarding the use of certain conflict minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and procedures regarding a manufacturer's efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P91_S1	The implementation of such rules has required us to incur additional expense and internal resources and may continue to do so in the future, particularly in the event that only a limited pool of suppliers are available to certify that products are free from conflict minerals.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P91_S2	Our failure to comply with any of the foregoing regulatory requirements or contractual obligations could result in our being directly or indirectly liable for costs, fines or penalties and third-party claims, and could jeopardize our ability to conduct business in the United States and foreign countries.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Our and our customers' operations would be seriously harmed if our logistics or facilities or those of our suppliers, our customers' suppliers or our contract manufacturers were to experience catastrophic loss.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Our and our customers' operations, logistics and facilities and those of our suppliers and contract manufacturers could be subject to a catastrophic loss from fire, flood, earthquake, volcanic eruption, work stoppages, power outages, acts of war, pandemic illnesses, energy shortages, theft of assets, other natural disasters or terrorist activity.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P94_S0	A substantial portion of our research and development activities, manufacturing, our corporate headquarters and other critical business operations are located near major earthquake faults in Santa Clara, California, an area with a history of seismic events.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P94_S1	Any such loss or detrimental impact to any of our operations, logistics or facilities could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and net sales and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P94_S2	While we have obtained insurance to cover most potential losses, after reviewing the costs and limitations associated with earthquake insurance, we have decided not to procure such insurance.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P94_S3	We believe that this decision is consistent with decisions reached by numerous other companies located nearby.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P94_S4	We cannot assure you that our existing insurance coverage will be adequate against all other possible losses.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P94_S5	Difficulties with our enterprise resource planning ( ERP ) system and other parts of our global information technology system could harm our business and results of operation.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P94_S6	If our network security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer's data or our data or our information technology systems, we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Like many modern multinational corporations, we maintain a global information technology system, including software products licensed from third parties.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P95_S1	Any system, network or Internet failures, misuse by system users, the hacking into or disruption caused by the unauthorized access by third parties or loss of license rights could disrupt our ability to timely and accurately manufacture and ship products or to report our financial information in compliance with the timelines mandated by the SEC.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P95_S2	Any such failure, misuse, hacking, disruptions or loss would likely cause a diversion of management's attention from the underlying business and could harm our operations.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P95_S3	In addition, a significant failure of our global information technology system could adversely affect our ability to complete an evaluation of our internal controls and attestation activities pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P96_S0	As part of our day-to-day business, we store our data and certain data about our customers in our global information technology system.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P96_S1	While our system is designed with access security, if a third party gains unauthorized access to our data, including any regarding our customers, such a security breach could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, loss of business, litigation and possible liability.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P96_S2	These security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P96_S3	Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers' data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P96_S4	Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P96_S5	Any security breach could result in a loss of confidence by our customers, damage our reputation, disrupt our business, lead to legal liability and negatively impact our future sales.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Changes in tax rates, tax liabilities or tax accounting rules could affect future results.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P98_S0	As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries and jurisdictions.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P98_S1	Significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P98_S2	Our future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries or states with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in the tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws, including the Base Erosion Profit Shifting ( BEPS ) project being conducted by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ).
21510_14_ITEM1A_P98_S3	In addition, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) and other tax authorities.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P99_S0	From time to time the United States, foreign and state governments make substantive changes to tax rules and the application of rules to companies, including various announcements from the United States government potentially impacting our ability to defer taxes on international earnings.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P99_S1	We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P99_S2	Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Federal securities laws, rules and regulations, as well as the rules and regulations of self-regulatory organizations such as NASDAQ and the NYSE, require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures, impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements, set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers, chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P101_S1	These laws, rules and regulations have increased and will continue to increase the scope, complexity and cost of our corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices, which could harm our results of operations and divert management's attention from business operations.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P102_S1	New or changed laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P102_S2	As a result, their application in practice may evolve over time.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P103_S0	We are committed to maintaining high standards of ethics, corporate governance and public disclosure.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P103_S1	Complying with evolving interpretations of new or changed legal requirements may cause us to incur higher costs as we revise current practices, policies and procedures, and may divert management time and attention from revenue generating to compliance activities.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P103_S2	If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, our reputation may also be harmed.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P104_S0	Governmental regulations, including duties, affecting the import or export of products could negatively affect our net sales.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P105_S0	The United States and many foreign governments impose tariffs and duties on the import and export of products, including some of those which we sell.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P105_S1	In particular, given our worldwide operations, we pay duties on certain products when they are imported into the United States for repair work as well as on certain of our products which are manufactured by our foreign subsidiaries.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P105_S2	These products can be subject to a duty on the product value.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P105_S3	Additionally, the United States and various foreign governments have imposed tariffs, controls, export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies, especially encryption technology.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P105_S4	From time to time, government agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology, such as requiring the escrow and governmental recovery of private encryption keys.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P105_S5	Governmental regulation of encryption technology and regulation of imports or exports, or our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products, could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our net sales.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P105_S6	From time to time our duty calculations and payments are audited by government agencies.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P105_S7	In the event of an adverse audit result, we could be liable for additional payments, duties, taxes and penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P106_S0	In addition, compliance with the directives of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls ( DDTC ) may result in substantial expenses and diversion of management.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P106_S1	Any failure to adequately address the directives of DDTC could result in civil fines or suspension or loss of our export privileges, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P107_S0	Our market is unpredictable and characterized by rapid technological changes and evolving standards demanding a significant investment in research and development, and, if we fail to address changing market conditions, our business and operating results will be harmed.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P108_S0	The photonics industry is characterized by extensive research and development, rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards.

21510_14_ITEM1A_P109_S1	Our success in generating net sales in this industry will depend on, among other things:
21510_14_ITEM1A_P110_S0	our ability to accurately predict and develop our products to meet industry standards.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P111_S0	For our fiscal years 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , our research and development costs were $79.1 million ( 10.0% of net sales), $82.8 million ( 10.2% of net sales) and $78.3 million ( 10.2% of net sales), respectively.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P111_S1	We cannot assure you that our expenditures for research and development will result in the introduction of new products or, if such products are introduced, that those products will achieve sufficient market acceptance or to generate sales to offset the costs of development.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P111_S2	Our failure to address rapid technological changes in our markets could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P112_S0	Failure to maintain effective internal controls may cause a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements or to cause us to delay filing our periodic reports with the SEC and adversely affect our stock price.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P113_S0	The SEC, as directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on Form 10-K that contain an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P113_S1	In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P113_S2	Although we test our internal control over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with the Section 404 requirements, our failure to maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements or a delay in our ability to timely file our periodic reports with the SEC, which ultimately could negatively impact our stock price.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P114_S0	Provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law, and our Change-of-Control Severance Plan may have anti-takeover effects that could prevent or delay a change in control.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P115_S0	Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition or make removal of incumbent directors or officers more difficult.
21510_14_ITEM1A_P115_S1	These provisions may discourage takeover attempts and bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price.

21510_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	IMRA America ( Imra ) filed a complaint for patent infringement against two of the Company s subsidiaries in the Regional Court of D sseldorf, Germany, captioned In re IMRA America Inc. versus Coherent Kaiserslautern GmbH et.
21510_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	The complaint alleges that the use of certain of the Company s lasers infringes upon EP Patent No. 754,103, entitled Method For Controlling Configuration of Laser Induced Breakdown and Ablation, issued November 5, 1997.
21510_14_ITEM3_P0_S2	The patent is owned by the University of Michigan and licensed to Imra.
21510_14_ITEM3_P0_S3	The complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages, the cost of court proceedings and seeks to permanently enjoin the Company from infringing the patent in the future.
21510_14_ITEM3_P0_S4	Management has made an accrual with respect to this matter and has determined, based on its current knowledge, that the amount or range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the amounts already accrued, is not reasonably estimable.
21510_14_ITEM3_P0_S5	Although we do not expect that such legal claims and litigation will ultimately have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, an adverse result in one or more matters could negatively affect our results in the period in which they occur.
21510_14_ITEM3_P1_S0	Income Tax Audits We are subject to taxation and file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions.
21510_14_ITEM3_P1_S1	For U.S. federal income tax purposes, all years prior to 2011 are closed.
21510_14_ITEM3_P1_S2	In our major foreign jurisdictions and our major state jurisdictions, the years prior to 2006 and 2010, respectively, are closed to examination.
21510_14_ITEM3_P1_S3	Earlier years in our various jurisdictions may remain open for adjustment to the extent that we have tax attribute carryforwards from those years.
21510_14_ITEM3_P1_S4	In December 2011 and January 2012, three of our German subsidiaries received notices of tax audits for the fiscal years 2006 through 2010.
21510_14_ITEM3_P1_S5	In fiscal year 2013, we received a preliminary assessment for two of the German subsidiaries and the amount is immaterial; the audit for the other German subsidiary is currently in process.
21510_14_ITEM3_P1_S6	In addition, we received in July 2014 a final tax assessment for our German subsidiary of Coherent Kaiserslautern GmbH (formerly Lumera Laser GmbH) that was acquired in December 2012 and was under audit for the fiscal years 2007 through 2009.
21510_14_ITEM3_P1_S7	The tax assessment is immaterial and it was recovered from the escrow account for the acquisition.
21510_14_ITEM3_P1_S8	Management believes that it has adequately provided for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.
21510_14_ITEM3_P2_S0	We regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions.
21510_14_ITEM3_P2_S1	It is reasonably possible that certain federal, foreign and state tax matters may be concluded in the next 12 months.
21510_14_ITEM3_P2_S2	Although the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that the balance of net unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties could be reduced by up to approximately $2.5 million in the next 12 months.
21510_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	The number of stockholders of record as of November 24, 2014 was 823 .
21510_14_ITEM5_P0_S1	On December 10, 2012, we announced that the Board of Directors approved a $1.00 per share special cash dividend on our outstanding common stock payable on December 27, 2012 to stockholders of record on December 19, 2012, resulting in a payment of $24.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.
21510_14_ITEM5_P0_S2	While we paid a cash dividend in fiscal 2013 and may elect to pay dividends in the future, we have no present intention to declare cash dividends.
21510_14_ITEM5_P0_S3	Our line of credit agreement requires bank pre-approval for the payment of cash dividends.
21510_14_ITEM5_P0_S4	There were no sales of unregistered securities in fiscal 2014 .
21510_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	There were no stock repurchases during the three months ended September 27, 2014 .

21510_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS Below is a summary of some of the quantitative performance indicators (as defined below) that are evaluated by management to assess our financial performance.
21510_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	Some of the indicators are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered as an alternative to any other measure for determining operating performance that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
21510_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	Definitions and analysis of these performance indicators are as follows: Bookings and Book-to-Bill Ratio Bookings represent orders received during the current period for products and services to be provided pursuant to service contracts.
21510_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	While we generally have not experienced a significant rate of cancellation, bookings are generally cancelable by our customers without substantial penalty and, therefore, we cannot assure all bookings will be converted to net sales.
21510_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	The book-to-bill ratio is calculated as annual bookings divided by annual net sales.
21510_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	This is an indication of the strength of our business but can sometimes be impacted by a single large order.
21510_14_ITEM7_P2_S2	A ratio greater than 1.0 indicates that demand for our products is greater than what we supply in the year whereas a ratio of less than 1.0 indicates that demand for our products is less than what we supply in the year.
21510_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	Fiscal 2014 bookings increased 16.1% from bookings in fiscal 2013 and our book-to-bill ratio increased from 0.95 in fiscal 2013 to 1.12 in fiscal 2014.
21510_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	The bookings increase included increases in the microelectronics ( 28% ) and OEM components and instrumentation ( 19% ) markets partially offset by decreases in the materials processing ( 2% ) and scientific ( 2% ) markets.
21510_14_ITEM7_P3_S2	Although fiscal 2014 bookings increased, bookings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 decreased from the third quarter of fiscal 2014, with decreases in the microelectronics, OEM components and instrumentation and materials processing markets partially offset by increases in the scientific market.
21510_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	Fiscal 2013 bookings decreased slightly from bookings in fiscal 2012 and our book-to-bill ratio decreased from 1.01 in fiscal 2012 to 0.95 in fiscal 2013.
21510_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	Bookings decreased 0.8% from fiscal 2012, with decreases in the microelectronics (10%) and scientific (4%) markets partially offset by increases in the materials processing (18%) and OEM components and instrumentation (13%) markets.
21510_14_ITEM7_P4_S2	Compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2013, decreases in bookings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 in the materials processing market were partially offset by increases in the OEM components and instrumentation, microelectronics and scientific markets.
21510_14_ITEM7_P4_S3	Although fiscal 2014 bookings increased 28% from bookings in fiscal 2013 and the book-to-bill ratio for the year was 1.18 , bookings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 decreased 37% from the third quarter of fiscal 2014 primarily due to timing of large excimer laser annealing orders for the flat panel display market and lower orders in the semiconductor capital equipment market due to timing of large service orders.
21510_14_ITEM7_P4_S4	Flat panel display orders for fiscal 2014 increased 78% from orders in fiscal 2013, but fourth quarter fiscal 2014 orders were lower primarily due to timing of large excimer laser annealing orders.
21510_14_ITEM7_P4_S5	In the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we received a large order from one customer for excimer laser annealing systems for low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS) processing, some of which shipped during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 with the majority scheduled for shipment during fiscal 2015.
21510_14_ITEM7_P4_S6	Our development efforts on the Linebeam 1500 are progressing as planned and we expect to make our first shipment towards the end of calendar 2014.
21510_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	The flat panel display market has been buoyed by successful product launches and share gains for Chinese smartphone manufacturers, which have led to increased demand for LTPS LCD displays.
21510_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	Both OLED and high definition LCD displays are manufactured with the use of our excimer laser annealing (ELA) tools.
21510_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	Price competition at the panel manufacturer level is fierce.
21510_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	Given these dynamics, customers are inquiring more about Linebeam systems larger than 750 millimeter to reduce the cost of the panel.
21510_14_ITEM7_P7_S2	We have also worked with our vendors to extend the lifetime of certain high cost components in the laser discharge units (LDU) used in our ELA tools.
21510_14_ITEM7_P7_S3	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we completed delivery of approximately $10 million of lasers used for sapphire processing and we do not know when, or whether, we will receive any follow-on orders.
21510_14_ITEM7_P7_S4	We expect continued fluctuations in order volumes on a quarterly basis.
21510_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	Advanced packaging ("API") orders decreased for the full fiscal year, but increased from orders in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 as the advanced packaging market is following trends in consumer electronics.
21510_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	PCB vendors in the supply chains for Apple and Chinese handset manufacturers have reported high utilization rates, which has led to modest order improvement for packaging lasers in the fourth quarter.
21510_14_ITEM7_P8_S2	Decreased inventory levels at key OEMs should stimulate orders in our second or third quarter of fiscal 2015.
21510_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	We have also introduced two new platforms at the recent Taiwan Printed Circuit Association printed circuit board show.
21510_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	The Avia-NX represents a price-performance breakthrough and should enable market share gains in via drilling in silicon, flex circuit packaging and other emerging applications.
21510_14_ITEM7_P9_S2	In addition, we launched a new CO 2 laser platform called the Hornet , which has specific performance and design attributes for the via drilling market, allowing integrators to eliminate acousto-optic modulators (AOM) from their designs saving significant cost and increasing available laser power and tool throughput.
21510_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	Orders from semiconductor capital equipment OEMs increased 13% for fiscal 2014, but were lower in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to the prior quarter due to high service bookings consistent with high fab utilization rates reported by industry experts in the third quarter of fiscal 2014.
21510_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	While demand from the semiconductor capital expenditure market remains strong, we have seen some significant swings over the last few quarters due to the timing of large service bookings.
21510_14_ITEM7_P10_S2	According to SEMI s worldwide forecast in August 2014, the near-term outlook through 2015 is robust with projected capital investments reaching record levels.
21510_14_ITEM7_P10_S3	While some industry experts have suggested a cyclical slowdown, we believe capital investment announcements for leading node from Intel and Samsung coupled with the march towards 3D memory indicates increasing demand.
21510_14_ITEM7_P10_S4	We are very well positioned at the leading edge of this market and should benefit from any investments in 3D memory.
21510_14_ITEM7_P10_S5	As always, utilization rates for legacy nodes will be a factor as they drive service demand and capacity expansion.
21510_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	OEM Components and Instrumentation Bookings in fiscal 2014 increased 19% from fiscal 2013 and the book-to-bill ratio for the year was 1.10 .
21510_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	However, orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 decreased from record-setting orders in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 due to the timing of volume orders from medical OEM accounts.
21510_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	Medical OEM orders increased significantly in fiscal 2014, but decreased sequentially from the third quarter of fiscal 2014.
21510_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	sequential decline, and the cataract market demand was high.
21510_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	In addition, dental bookings and demand for ophthalmic lasers were strong.
21510_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	These orders signal confidence in both patient-pay and insurance-covered procedures.
21510_14_ITEM7_P12_S3	We expect continued growth for cataract and dental applications over the next few years and are developing new products in support of this.
21510_14_ITEM7_P12_S4	Medical OEM accounts are seeing steady to improving demand, especially in the ophthalmic space for vision correction and disease management.
21510_14_ITEM7_P12_S5	Bioinstrumentation orders were up modestly on a sequential basis with customers in flow cytometry and DNA sequencing managing their inventory positions.
21510_14_ITEM7_P12_S6	Flow cytometry and microscopy applications drove most of the OEM instrumentation bookings, which is consistent with trends over the past few years.
21510_14_ITEM7_P12_S7	The cytometry market is seeing an influx of products from Chinese manufacturers, whose market share is small today, but could grow substantially in the next 3-5 years as they broaden their reagent offerings, advance their cytometers and address both the high-end and budget markets.
21510_14_ITEM7_P12_S8	This is one of the reasons we developed the BioRay product, which offers performance advantages and a competitive cost of ownership compared to light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
21510_14_ITEM7_P12_S9	We are also pursuing business in rapid DNA sequencing with our high-performance HOPS platform for use in a diverse range of applications from agriculture to cancer gene analysis.
21510_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	Materials Processing Annual bookings decreased 2% from fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2014 's book-to-bill ratio was 1.05 .
21510_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	Bookings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 were strong although they decreased from the prior quarter due to the receipt of a number of annual orders in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 across the materials processing market.
21510_14_ITEM7_P13_S2	We received volume orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 from a variety of applications including: (1) short-pulse lasers for non-thermal processing, (2) CO 2 and pulsed UV lasers for non-metal additive manufacturing, and (3) semiconductor lasers for Chinese laser manufacturers.
21510_14_ITEM7_P13_S3	The growth of semiconductor laser sales in China is consistent with vertical integration at the low-end of the marking and engraving market.
21510_14_ITEM7_P13_S4	We have seen a similar trend in low-power CO 2 marking for several years.
21510_14_ITEM7_P13_S5	Incidentally, this trend is not limited to China as U.S. and European manufacturers have taken similar steps to maintain financial competitiveness.
21510_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	Our efforts in the kilowatt space have had mixed results.
21510_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	Our multi-kilowatt direct diode portfolio has had very high year-over-year growth due to partnerships with welding and cladding companies.
21510_14_ITEM7_P14_S2	Since the release of an updated product line, our laser manufacturing tool business has also had very high growth and we expect this growth to continue with the release of new products targeting the thin metal cutting market.
21510_14_ITEM7_P14_S3	These positive results are offset by disappointing ones in the fiber laser space where we failed to reach our $10 million sales objective for fiscal 2014.
21510_14_ITEM7_P14_S4	The time from design win to volume has been slower than expected and it has taken longer than planned to launch the new multi-kilowatt platform, which addresses the highest demand point of the market.
21510_14_ITEM7_P14_S5	We are on track to release the higher power products in fiscal 2015.
21510_14_ITEM7_P14_S6	Although fiscal 2014 orders decreased 2% from bookings in fiscal 2013 , the book-to-bill ratio for the year was 1.04 .
21510_14_ITEM7_P14_S7	Orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 increased significantly from the third quarter of fiscal 2014 as the U.S. market delivered a typically strong performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.
21510_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	The overall scientific market is stable, although there are several underlying trends.
21510_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	The U.S. market delivered a typically strong performance in the fourth quarter and anchored worldwide bookings.
21510_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	China and Korea maintained their high investment rate across multiple applications as opposed to Europe and Japan, which both lagged either due to timing issues or funding initiatives.
21510_14_ITEM7_P16_S2	In Japan, life sciences funding is outpacing physical sciences consistent with policy statements, but spending in life sciences has been essentially flat for most of fiscal 2014.
21510_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	The EU and the U.S. both launched major programs to study the human brain.
21510_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	The U.S. BRAIN project is trying to develop a deeper understanding of how the brain works through the study of clusters of hundreds or thousands of neurons, involving many experimental techniques including laser imaging.
21510_14_ITEM7_P17_S2	The project is gaining momentum and there is hope for a two or three-fold expansion of the current annual $100 million budget, enabling the development of novel techniques to advance the studies.
21510_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	Europe s Human Brain Project (HBP) is attempting to create a large scale map of the neural network through computational analysis, which has disenfranchised many experimental neuroscientists.
21510_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	We do not anticipate any significant funding changes for fiscal 2015.
21510_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	We will be focusing on market share gains through our industrialized scientific product strategy as well as the introduction of several new offerings.
21510_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	Net Sales Net sales include sales of lasers, laser tools, related accessories and service.
21510_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	Net sales for fiscal 2014 decreased 1.9% from fiscal 2013 .
21510_14_ITEM7_P20_S2	Net sales for fiscal 2013 increased 5.3% from fiscal 2012.
21510_14_ITEM7_P20_S3	For a description of the reasons for changes in net sales refer to the "Results of Operations" section below.
21510_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	Gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit percentage") is calculated as gross profit for the period divided by net sales for the period.
21510_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	Gross profit percentage for SLS increased to 42.1% in fiscal 2014 from 41.7% in fiscal 2013 and decreased from 43.2% in fiscal 2012 .
21510_14_ITEM7_P21_S2	Gross profit percentage for CLC decreased to 33.9% in fiscal 2014 from 36.2% in fiscal 2013 and from 36.7% in fiscal 2012 .
21510_14_ITEM7_P21_S3	For a description of the reasons for changes in gross profit refer to the "Results of Operations" section below.
21510_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	Research and Development as a Percentage of Net Sales Research and development as a percentage of net sales ("R D percentage") is calculated as research and development expense for the period divided by net sales for the period.
21510_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	Management considers R D percentage to be an important indicator in managing our business as investing in new technologies is a key to future growth.
21510_14_ITEM7_P22_S2	R D percentage decreased to 10.0% from 10.2% in fiscal 2013 and 10.2% in fiscal 2012 .
21510_14_ITEM7_P22_S3	For a description of the reasons for changes in R D spending refer to the "Results of Operations" section below.
21510_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows primarily represents the excess of cash collected from billings to our customers and other receipts over cash paid to our vendors for expenses and inventory purchases to run our business.
21510_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	We believe that cash flows from operations are an important performance indicator because cash generation over the long term is essential to maintaining a healthy business and providing funds to help fuel growth.
21510_14_ITEM7_P23_S2	For a description of the reasons for changes in Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities refer to the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section below.
21510_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	Days Sales Outstanding in Receivables We calculate days sales outstanding ("DSO") in receivables as net receivables at the end of the period divided by net sales during the period and then multiplied by the number of days in the period, using 360 days for years.
21510_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	DSO in receivables indicates how well we are managing our collection of receivables, with lower DSO in receivables resulting in higher working capital availability.
21510_14_ITEM7_P24_S2	The more money we have tied up in receivables, the less money we have available for research and development, acquisitions, expansion, marketing and other activities to grow our business.
21510_14_ITEM7_P24_S3	Our DSO in receivables for fiscal 2014 increased 1.4 days from fiscal 2013 to 62.2 days.
21510_14_ITEM7_P24_S4	The increase in DSO in receivables is primarily due to a higher concentration of sales with longer payment terms particularly in Asia and a higher concentration of sales in the last month of the fiscal year.
21510_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	Annualized Fourth Quarter Inventory Turns We calculate annualized fourth quarter inventory turns as cost of sales during the fourth quarter annualized and divided by net inventories at the end of the fourth quarter.
21510_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	This indicates how well we are managing our inventory levels, with higher inventory turns resulting in more working capital availability and a higher return on our investments in inventory.
21510_14_ITEM7_P25_S2	The more money we have tied up in inventory, the less money we have available for research and development, acquisitions, expansion, marketing and other activities to grow our business.
21510_14_ITEM7_P25_S3	Our annualized inventory turns for fiscal 2014 decreased to 2.9 turns from 3.0 turns in fiscal 2013 primarily due to timing of inventory levels to support the large annealing laser systems partially offset by lower service inventory levels and the impact of foreign exchange rates.
21510_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	Capital Spending as a Percentage of Net Sales Capital spending as a percentage of net sales ("capital spending percentage") is calculated as capital expenditures for the period divided by net sales for the period.
21510_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	Capital spending percentage indicates the extent to which we are expanding or improving our operations, including investments in technology and equipment.
21510_14_ITEM7_P26_S2	Management monitors capital spending levels as this assists management in measuring our cash flows, net of capital expenditures.
21510_14_ITEM7_P26_S3	Our capital spending percentage increased to 2.9% in fiscal 2014 from 2.7% in fiscal 2013 and decreased from 4.7% in fiscal 2012 .
21510_14_ITEM7_P26_S4	The fiscal 2014 increase was primarily due to higher purchases of production-related assets to support new product introductions and growth in Asia, particularly to support service and refurbishment capacity in Korea and China.
21510_14_ITEM7_P26_S5	The fiscal 2013 decrease was primarily due to investments made in fiscal 2012 for manufacturing and refurbishment capacity in Germany and Korea.
21510_14_ITEM7_P26_S6	We expect capital spending for fiscal 2015 to increase to approximately 4.0% of net sales due to rollover of forecasted spending that did not occur in fiscal 2014 and investments in new capacity.
21510_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	We define adjusted EBITDA as operating income adjusted for depreciation, amortization, stock compensation expenses, major restructuring costs and certain other non-operating income and expense items.
21510_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	Key initiatives to reach our goals for EBITDA improvements include utilization of our Asian manufacturing locations, rationalizing our supply chain and continued leveraging of our infrastructure.
21510_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	We utilize a number of different financial measures, both GAAP and non-GAAP, such as adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales, in analyzing and assessing our overall business performance, for making operating decisions and for forecasting and planning future periods.
21510_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	We consider the use of non-GAAP financial measures helpful in assessing our current financial performance and ongoing operations.
21510_14_ITEM7_P28_S2	While we use non-GAAP financial measures as a tool to enhance our understanding of certain aspects of our financial performance, we do not consider these measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial measures.
21510_14_ITEM7_P28_S3	We provide adjusted EBITDA in order to enhance investors' understanding of our ongoing operations.
21510_14_ITEM7_P28_S4	This measure is used by some investors when assessing our performance.
21510_14_ITEM7_P28_S5	Below is the reconciliation of our net income as a percentage of net sales to our adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales:

21510_14_ITEM7_P37_S1	Note that fiscal 2015 will consist of 53 weeks.
21510_14_ITEM7_P37_S2	The following table sets forth, for the years indicated, the percentage of total net sales represented by the line items reflected in our consolidated statement of operations:
21510_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	Refer to Item 6 "Selected Financial Data" for a description of significant events that impacted the results of operations for fiscal years 2014 , 2013 and 2012 .
21510_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the amount of net sales and their relative percentages of total net sales by market application (dollars in thousands):
21510_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	During fiscal 2014 , net sales decreased by $15.5 million , or 2% , compared to fiscal 2013 , with sales decreases in the microelectronics, materials processing and scientific and government programs markets partially offset by increases in the OEM components and instrumentation market.
21510_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	Microelectronics sales decreased $31.9 million , or 8% , primarily due to lower sales in flat panel display and advanced packaging applications partially offset by higher sales in semiconductor applications.
21510_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	The decrease in scientific and government programs market sales of $0.5 million , or 0.4% , during fiscal 2014 was primarily due to lower demand for advanced research applications used by university and government research groups.
21510_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	The increase in the OEM components and instrumentation market of $20.0 million , or 13% , during fiscal 2014 was primarily due to higher shipments for medical and bio-instrumentation (including the acquisition of Lumera at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2013) applications partially offset by lower shipments for military applications due to timing of military project spending.
21510_14_ITEM7_P40_S2	During fiscal 2013, net sales increased by $41.0 million, or 5%, compared to fiscal 2012, with sales increases in the microelectronics, materials processing and OEM components and instrumentation markets partially offset by decreases in the scientific and government programs market.
21510_14_ITEM7_P40_S3	Microelectronics sales increased $42.9 million, or 11%, primarily due to higher sales in flat panel display applications.
21510_14_ITEM7_P40_S4	Materials processing sales increased $13.0 million, or 12%, during fiscal 2013 primarily due to higher shipments for marking, heat treating and cutting applications and the acquisition of Lumera at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2013.
21510_14_ITEM7_P40_S5	The increase in the OEM components and instrumentation market of $6.2 million, or 4%, during fiscal 2013 was primarily due to higher shipments for bio-instrumentation and medical (including the acquisition of Lumera at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2013) applications partially offset by lower shipments for military and graphic arts and display applications.
21510_14_ITEM7_P40_S6	Military shipments were lower due to timing of military project spending and the impact from sequestration budget cuts and graphic arts and display shipments decreased due primarily to lower demand for light show lasers from entertainment customers.
21510_14_ITEM7_P40_S7	The decrease in scientific and government programs market sales of $21.1 million, or 15%, during fiscal 2013 was primarily due to lower demand for advanced research applications used by university and government research groups partly due to lower U.S. and global stimulus funding and from budget cuts from government agencies.
21510_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	Backlog represents orders which we expect to be shipped within 12 months and the current portion of service contracts.
21510_14_ITEM7_P41_S1	Orders used to compute backlog are generally cancelable and subject to rescheduling by our customers without substantial penalties.
21510_14_ITEM7_P41_S2	Historically, we have not experienced a significant rate of cancellation or rescheduling outside the 12 month period, though we cannot guarantee that the rate of cancellations or rescheduling will not increase in the future.
21510_14_ITEM7_P41_S3	We continue to have a sizable backlog of orders shippable within 12 months of $328.3 million at September 27, 2014, including a significant concentration in the flat panel display market (41%).
21510_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	The timing for shipments of our higher average selling price excimer products in the flat panel display market have historically fluctuated and are in the future expected to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter due to customer scheduling, our ability to manufacture these products and/or availability of supplies.
21510_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	As a result, the timing to convert orders for these products to net sales will likely fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter.
21510_14_ITEM7_P42_S2	Looking at our prior ten years of actual results, excluding a couple of recovery years, our first quarter revenues generally ranged 2% to 12% below the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year.
21510_14_ITEM7_P42_S3	In fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , one customer accounted for 13%, 14% and 11% of net sales, respectively.
21510_14_ITEM7_P42_S4	In fiscal 2012 , another customer accounted for 11% of net sales.
21510_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	Segments We are organized into two reportable operating segments: Specialty Lasers and Systems ("SLS") and Commercial Lasers and Components ("CLC").
21510_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	SLS develops and manufactures configurable, advanced-performance products largely serving the microelectronics, scientific research and government programs and OEM components and instrumentation markets.
21510_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	CLC focuses on higher volume products that are offered in set configurations.
21510_14_ITEM7_P44_S2	CLC's primary markets include materials processing, OEM components and instrumentation and microelectronics.
21510_14_ITEM7_P44_S3	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the amount of net sales and their relative percentages of total net sales by segment (dollars in thousands):
21510_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2014 decreased $15.5 million , or 2% , compared to fiscal 2013 , with decreases of $6.1 million , or 1% , in our SLS segment and decreases of $9.4 million , or 4% , in our CLC segment.
21510_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	Net sales for fiscal 2013 increased $41.0 million, or 5%, compared to fiscal 2012, with increases of $22.8 million, or 4%, in our SLS segment and increases of $18.2 million, or 8%, in our CLC segment.
21510_14_ITEM7_P45_S2	The decrease in our SLS segment sales in fiscal 2014 was primarily due to lower revenue for flat panel display annealing applications due to timing for shipment of large systems, lower shipments for ink jet nozzle drilling applications and lower materials processing applications sales partially offset by higher shipments for semiconductor and medical applications.
21510_14_ITEM7_P45_S3	The increase in our SLS segment sales in fiscal 2013 was primarily due to a $23.3 million increase from the sale of products acquired through our acquisitions of Lumera and Innolight at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2013.
21510_14_ITEM7_P45_S4	The increase was offset by a $0.5 million decrease in sales of our other SLS products primarily due to lower shipments for scientific and government programs, solar, advanced packaging, medical and semiconductor applications partially offset by higher revenue for flat panel display annealing applications.
21510_14_ITEM7_P45_S5	The decrease in our CLC segment sales from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to lower advanced packaging sales due to market softness and lower military application sales partially offset by higher sales for medical and instrumentation applications.
21510_14_ITEM7_P45_S6	The increase in our CLC segment sales from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to higher advanced packaging, instrumentation and materials processing application sales partially offset by lower sales for scientific and military applications.
21510_14_ITEM7_P45_S7	Our gross profit rate decreased by 0.4% to 39.4% in fiscal 2014 from 39.8% in fiscal 2013 primarily due to unfavorable product margins (0.4%) resulting from unfavorable mix in the OEM and instrumentation and material processing markets in the CLC segment and unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates in the SLS segment as well as higher intangibles amortization (0.2%) due to the acquisitions of Lumera at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and Innolight in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 partially offset by lower warranty costs as a percentage of sales (0.2%) due to fewer warranty events in the SLS segment.
21510_14_ITEM7_P45_S8	Our gross profit rate decreased by 1.3% to 39.8% in fiscal 2013 from 41.1% in fiscal 2012 primarily due to unfavorable product margins (0.8%) resulting from the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, the impact of lower volumes in several business units in the first two quarters of fiscal 2013 and higher than expected manufacturing costs due to longer cycle times related to the production of our complex flat panel annealing systems, partially offset by favorable product mix in the microelectronics market due to a higher concentration of service business; higher intangibles amortization (0.6%) due to the acquisitions of Lumera at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and Innolight in the first quarter of fiscal 2013; and higher other costs (0.3%) primarily due to inventory step up amortization from the acquisition of Lumera and slightly higher inventory provisions.
21510_14_ITEM7_P45_S9	These decreases were net of lower warranty costs (0.4%) due to lower warranty expenses as a percentage of net sales in the microelectronics market.
21510_14_ITEM7_P45_S10	Our gross profit rate has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors including market mix, pricing on volume orders, our ability to manufacture advanced and more complex products, manufacturing efficiencies, excess and obsolete inventory write-downs, warranty costs, pricing by competitors or suppliers, new product introductions, production volume, customization and reconfiguration of systems, commodity prices and foreign currency fluctuations, particularly the recent weakening of the Japanese Yen and Euro.
21510_14_ITEM7_P45_S11	Our SLS gross profit rate increased by 0.4% to 42.1% in fiscal 2014 from 41.7% in fiscal 2013 primarily due to lower warranty costs (0.8%) due to fewer warranty events and lower other costs (0.1%) due to inventory step up amortization from the acquisition of Lumera recorded in fiscal 2013 net of higher fiscal 2014 inventory provisions as a percentage of sales.
21510_14_ITEM7_P45_S12	The decreases were partially offset by higher intangibles amortization (0.3%) due to the acquisitions of Lumera at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and Innolight in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and the beginning of amortization of in-process research and development (IPR D) for Lumera in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 as well as unfavorable product cost (0.2%) due to higher scrap, rework and engineering change order variances, unfavorable mix in the microelectronics and medical markets and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
21510_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	other costs (0.1%) primarily due to inventory step up amortization from the acquisition of Lumera.
21510_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	These decreases were partially offset by lower warranty costs (0.3%) due to fewer warranty events and higher sales volumes.
21510_14_ITEM7_P46_S2	Commercial Lasers and Components Our CLC gross profit rate decreased by 2.3% to 33.9% in fiscal 2014 from 36.2% in fiscal 2013 primarily due to higher warranty costs (1.2%) due to the impact of a higher installed base on lower revenues in the advanced packaging market as well as new product introductions in the materials processing and OEM components and instrumentation markets, unfavorable product costs (1.0%) resulting from unfavorable mix in the OEM components and instrumentation and material processing markets and higher other costs (0.1%) due to slightly higher inventory provisions as a percentage of sales net of lower freight and duty.
21510_14_ITEM7_P46_S3	Our CLC gross profit rate decreased by 0.5% to 36.2% in fiscal 2013 from 36.7% in fiscal 2012 primarily due to unfavorable product costs (0.6%) resulting from unfavorable mix in the OEM components and instrumentation market net of the impact of higher volumes, higher other costs (0.5%) due to higher inventory provisions as a percentage of revenue and higher intangibles amortization (0.1%) partially offset by lower warranty and installation costs (0.7%) due to fewer warranty events.
21510_14_ITEM7_P46_S4	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the amount of operating expenses and their relative percentages of total net sales by the line items reflected in our consolidated statement of operations (dollars in thousands):
21510_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	Research and development Fiscal 2014 research and development ("R D") expenses decreased $3.7 million , or 4% , from fiscal 2013 , and decreased to 10.0% from 10.2% of sales.
21510_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	The $3.7 million decrease was primarily due to $5.3 million lower project spending as a result of higher customer reimbursements for development projects net of higher spending on various projects and increased headcount.
21510_14_ITEM7_P47_S2	The decreases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates ($1.2 million) and $0.4 million higher other spending including higher charges for increases in deferred compensation plan liabilities with the related expenses for decreases in deferred compensation assets recorded in other income (expense) and higher stock-based compensation expense.
21510_14_ITEM7_P47_S3	On a segment basis, SLS spending decreased $2.9 million primarily due to lower net spending on projects due to higher customer reimbursements net of higher other spending on projects partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates.
21510_14_ITEM7_P47_S4	CLC spending decreased $1.2 million primarily due lower spending on projects.
21510_14_ITEM7_P47_S5	Corporate and other spending increased $0.4 million due to higher charges for increases in deferred compensation plan liabilities and higher stock-based compensation expense.
21510_14_ITEM7_P47_S6	Fiscal 2013 research and development ("R D") expenses increased $4.5 million, or 6%, from fiscal 2012, but remained flat as a percentage of sales.
21510_14_ITEM7_P47_S7	The increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Lumera and Innolight in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 ($3.9 million), higher payroll and other spending on projects ($0.5 million) and higher stock-based compensation expense ($0.3 million) partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates ($0.2 million).
21510_14_ITEM7_P47_S8	On a segment basis, SLS spending increased $2.7 million primarily due to the acquisitions of Lumera and Innolight partially offset by lower project spending and the impact of foreign exchange rates.
21510_14_ITEM7_P47_S9	CLC spending increased $1.5 million primarily due to higher payroll and other spending on projects.
21510_14_ITEM7_P47_S10	Corporate and other spending increased $0.3 million.
21510_14_ITEM7_P47_S11	Selling, general and administrative Fiscal 2014 selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses increased $4.5 million , or 3% , from fiscal 2013 .
21510_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	assets recorded in other income (expense); and $0.5 million related to the acquisitions of Lumera and Innolight in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.
21510_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	The increases were partially offset by $0.1 million lower other variable spending on consulting and legal costs for acquisitions and lower external sales representative commissions net of the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
21510_14_ITEM7_P48_S2	On a segment basis, SLS segment expenses increased $2.0 million primarily due to higher payroll spending, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and the acquisitions of Lumera and Innolight partially offset by lower external sales representative commissions.
21510_14_ITEM7_P48_S3	CLC spending increased $2.6 million primarily due to higher payroll spending and higher other variable spending partially offset by lower external sales representative commissions.
21510_14_ITEM7_P48_S4	Spending for Corporate and other decreased $0.1 million primarily due to lower legal and consulting related to acquisitions and lower other variable spending partially offset by higher charges for increases in deferred compensation plan liabilities and higher payroll spending.
21510_14_ITEM7_P48_S5	Fiscal 2013 selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses increased $11.0 million, or 8%, from fiscal 2012.
21510_14_ITEM7_P48_S6	The increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Lumera and Innolight in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 ($4.0 million), $3.3 million higher payroll spending due to higher headcount and increased salaries, higher performance-related compensation spending and higher sales commissions, $2.7 million higher other variable spending on consulting and legal costs, external sales representative commissions, tradeshows and other as well as $1.9 million higher stock-based compensation expense partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates ($0.9 million).
21510_14_ITEM7_P48_S7	On a segment basis, SLS segment expenses increased $5.6 million primarily due to the acquisitions of Lumera and Innolight, higher payroll spending and higher other variable spending partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
21510_14_ITEM7_P48_S8	CLC spending increased $2.0 million primarily due to higher other variable spending and higher payroll spending.
21510_14_ITEM7_P48_S9	Spending for Corporate and other increased $3.4 million primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expense, higher other variable spending and higher payroll spending.
21510_14_ITEM7_P48_S10	Amortization of intangible assets Amortization of intangible assets decreased $1.7 million , or 33% , from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the completion of amortization of certain intangibles from the acquisition of Lumera and other prior acquisitions.
21510_14_ITEM7_P48_S11	Amortization of intangible assets decreased $5.3 million, or 51%, from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013 primarily due to the fourth quarter fiscal 2012 impairment of $4.0 million of Hypertronics intangibles and the completion of amortization of certain intangibles (including Hypertronics) related to prior acquisitions partially offset by amortization from the acquisitions of Lumera and Innolight in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.
21510_14_ITEM7_P48_S12	Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net, increased $3.8 million from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014 .
21510_14_ITEM7_P48_S13	The increase was primarily due to $2.1 million higher gains, net of expenses, on our deferred compensation plan assets and higher net foreign currency exchange gains ($1.5 million) primarily due to more favorable movement in the Japanese Yen-Euro cross rate during fiscal 2014.
21510_14_ITEM7_P48_S14	Other income (expense), net, decreased $3.2 million from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013.
21510_14_ITEM7_P48_S15	The decrease was primarily due to higher net foreign currency exchange losses ($3.3 million) primarily due to the significant movement in the Japanese Yen against the Euro certain times in the first and third quarters of fiscal 2013.
21510_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	Income taxes The effective tax rate on income before income taxes for fiscal 2014 of 25.4% was lower than the statutory rate of 35.0%.
21510_14_ITEM7_P49_S1	This was primarily due to differences related to the benefit of income subject to foreign tax rates that are lower than U.S. statutory tax rates including Korea and Singapore tax exemptions and the benefit of foreign tax credits.
21510_14_ITEM7_P49_S2	These amounts are partially offset by deemed dividend inclusions under the Subpart F tax rules, stock compensation not deductible for tax purposes and limitations on the deductibility of compensation under IRC Section 162(m).
21510_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	The effective tax rate on income before income taxes for fiscal 2013 of 20.5% was lower than the statutory rate of 35.0%.
21510_14_ITEM7_P50_S1	This was primarily due to differences related to the benefit of income subject to foreign tax rates that are lower than U.S. statutory tax rates including Korea and Singapore tax exemptions, the benefit of foreign tax credits, the benefit of the federal research and development tax credits including renewal of the federal research and development tax credits for fiscal 2012 and the benefit of releasing foreign tax reserves accrued under ASC 740-10 Income Taxes and related interest.
21510_14_ITEM7_P50_S2	These amounts are partially offset by deemed dividend inclusions under the Subpart F tax rules, stock compensation not deductible for tax purposes and limitations on the deductibility of compensation under IRC Section 162(m).
21510_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	The effective tax rate on income before income taxes for fiscal 2012 of 30.5% was lower than the statutory rate of 35.0%.
21510_14_ITEM7_P51_S1	This was primarily due to the benefit of income subject to foreign tax rates that are lower than U.S. tax rates and the benefit of releasing state tax reserves accrued under ASC 740-10 and related interest.
21510_14_ITEM7_P51_S2	During fiscal 2014, we increased our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by $1.0 million to $14.4 million primarily due to the reduced ability to utilize California and other states research and development tax credits.
21510_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	2013, we increased our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by $4.3 million to $13.4 million primarily due to the reduced ability to utilize California and other states research and development tax credits.
21510_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	During fiscal 2012, we increased our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by $0.3 million to $9.1 million primarily due to the reduced ability to utilize California research and development tax credits and offset by the net increased ability to utilize foreign tax attributes and net operating losses of our subsidiaries.
21510_14_ITEM7_P52_S2	In making the determination to record the valuation allowance, management considered the likelihood of future taxable income and feasible and prudent tax planning strategies to realize deferred tax assets.
21510_14_ITEM7_P52_S3	In the future, if we determine that we expect to realize deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the valuation allowance will affect income in the period such determination is made.
21510_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	Coherent Korea received the final approval for a High-Tech tax exemption in 2013 from the Korean authorities and it is subject to capital contribution limitations.
21510_14_ITEM7_P53_S1	The impact of this tax exemption decreased Korean income taxes by approximately $2.4 million in fiscal 2014.
21510_14_ITEM7_P53_S2	The benefit of the tax holiday on fiscal 2014 net income per share (diluted) was $0.10.
21510_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	Coherent Singapore had previously received a Pioneer Status tax exemption from the Singapore authorities effective from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2017, and it may be extended if certain additional requirements are satisfied.
21510_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	The tax holiday is conditional upon our meeting certain revenue, business spending and employment thresholds.
21510_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	Although Coherent Singapore had income in fiscal 2014, this amount was largely offset by a loss carryforward from fiscal 2012.
21510_14_ITEM7_P56_S1	The benefit of the Singapore tax holiday in fiscal 2014 net of the loss carryforward is therefore not significant.
21510_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity and capital resources At September 27, 2014 , we had assets classified as cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in an aggregate amount of $318.3 million , compared to $250.1 million at September 28, 2013 .
21510_14_ITEM7_P57_S1	At September 27, 2014 , approximately $201.3 million of this cash and securities was held in certain of our foreign subsidiaries, $67.9 million of which was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
21510_14_ITEM7_P57_S2	We currently have approximately $197.1 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries where we intend to permanently reinvest our accumulated earnings in these entities and our current plans do not demonstrate a need for these funds to support our domestic operations.
21510_14_ITEM7_P57_S3	If, however, a portion of these funds were needed for and distributed to our operations in the United States, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes.
21510_14_ITEM7_P57_S4	The amount of the taxes due would depend on the amount and manner of repatriation, as well as the location from where the funds are repatriated.
21510_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	We actively monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold these assets, primarily focusing on the safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield on these assets.
21510_14_ITEM7_P58_S1	We diversify our cash and cash equivalents and investments among various financial institutions, money market funds and sovereign debt in order to reduce our exposure should any one of these financial institutions or financial instruments fail or encounter difficulties.
21510_14_ITEM7_P58_S2	To date, we have not experienced any material loss or lack of access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments.
21510_14_ITEM7_P58_S3	However, we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets.
21510_14_ITEM7_P58_S4	In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we converted $62.7 million of cash and securities held in certain of our foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars and invested those funds within a European subsidiary whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar.
21510_14_ITEM7_P58_S5	At September 27, 2014 , this subsidiary has $127.6 million of U.S. dollar denominated investments primarily in U.S. Treasury Securities, Corporate Notes and Commercial Paper.
21510_14_ITEM7_P58_S6	Accordingly, there is no translation expense arising from this entity holding U.S. dollar denominated investments.
21510_14_ITEM7_P58_S7	The converted funds are not intended to be repatriated to the U.S. and no U.S. tax was triggered on the transfer of these funds to the European subsidiary.
21510_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	Sources and Uses of Cash Historically, our primary source of cash has been provided by operations.
21510_14_ITEM7_P59_S1	Other sources of cash in the past three fiscal years include proceeds received from the sale of our stock through our employee stock option and purchase plans.
21510_14_ITEM7_P59_S2	Our historical uses of cash have primarily been for the repurchase of our common stock, capital expenditures, acquisitions of businesses and technologies and the payment of a one-time cash dividend in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.
21510_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $24.1 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 and increased by $50.8 million in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 .
21510_14_ITEM7_P60_S1	The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2014 was primarily due to lower cash flows from the timing of inventory purchases to support new products and accounts payable, lower net income, lower cash flows from the timing of accounts receivable due to higher days sales outstanding and lower income from operations partially offset by higher cash flows from the timing of other current liabilities.
21510_14_ITEM7_P60_S2	The increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2013 was primarily due to higher cash flows from timing of accounts payable payments, improved inventory turns, timing of other current assets and liabilities as well as improved accounts receivable days sales outstanding partially offset by timing of tax payments.
21510_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short term investments combined with cash to be provided by operating activities will be adequate to cover our working capital needs and planned capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months to the extent such items are known or are reasonably determinable based on current business and market conditions.
21510_14_ITEM7_P61_S1	However, we may elect to finance certain of our capital expenditure requirements through borrowings under our bank credit facilities or other sources of capital.
21510_14_ITEM7_P61_S2	We continue to follow our strategy to further strengthen our financial position by using available cash flow to fund operations.
21510_14_ITEM7_P61_S3	We intend to continue pursuing acquisition opportunities at valuations we believe are reasonable based upon market conditions.
21510_14_ITEM7_P61_S4	However, we cannot accurately predict the timing, size and success of our acquisition efforts or our associated potential capital commitments.
21510_14_ITEM7_P61_S5	Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire businesses on terms acceptable to us.
21510_14_ITEM7_P61_S6	We expect to fund future acquisitions primarily through existing cash balances and cash flows from operations.
21510_14_ITEM7_P61_S7	If required, we will look for additional borrowings or consider the issuance of securities.
21510_14_ITEM7_P61_S8	The extent to which we will be willing or able to use our common stock to make acquisitions will depend on its market value at the time and the willingness of potential sellers to accept it as full or partial payment.
21510_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	On December 10, 2012, we announced that the Board of Directors approved a $1.00 per share special cash dividend on our outstanding common stock payable on December 27, 2012 to stockholders of record on December 19, 2012, resulting in a payment of $24.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.
21510_14_ITEM7_P62_S1	We do not expect to pay any additional dividends in the foreseeable future.
21510_14_ITEM7_P62_S2	On August 25, 2011, we announced that the Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $50.0 million of our common stock.
21510_14_ITEM7_P62_S3	The program was authorized for 12 months from the date of authorization.
21510_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	During fiscal 2011, we repurchased and retired 586,200 shares of outstanding common stock at an average price of $42.67 per share for a total of $25.0 million, excluding expenses.
21510_14_ITEM7_P63_S1	Under this program, during fiscal 2012, we repurchased and retired 543,200 shares of outstanding common stock at an average price of $45.99 per share for a total of $25.0 million, excluding expenses, completing the repurchase.
21510_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	On October 4, 2012 , the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $25.0 million of our common stock.
21510_14_ITEM7_P64_S1	The program was authorized for 12 months from the date of authorization.
21510_14_ITEM7_P64_S2	No shares were purchased under this program.
21510_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	On July 25, 2014, the Board of Directors authorized a buyback program whereby we are authorized to repurchase up to $25.0 million of our common stock from time to time through July 31, 2015.
21510_14_ITEM7_P65_S1	No shares were purchased under this program in fiscal 2014.
21510_14_ITEM7_P65_S2	Additional sources of cash available to us were domestic and international currency lines of credit and bank credit facilities totaling $64.6 million as of September 27, 2014 , of which $61.6 million was unused and available.
21510_14_ITEM7_P65_S3	These unsecured credit facilities were used in Europe and Japan during fiscal 2014 .
21510_14_ITEM7_P65_S4	Our domestic line of credit consists of a $50.0 million unsecured revolving credit account with Union Bank of California, which expires on May 31, 2017 and is subject to covenants related to financial ratios and tangible net worth and we are in compliance with these covenants at September 27, 2014.
21510_14_ITEM7_P65_S5	No amounts have been drawn upon our domestic line of credit and $3.0 million of the international currency lines has been used as guarantees as of September 27, 2014 .
21510_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 5.8 :1 at September 27, 2014 , compared to 4.3 :1 at September 28, 2013 .
21510_14_ITEM7_P66_S1	The increase in our ratio is primarily due increases in cash and short-term investments as well as decreases in income taxes payable.
21510_14_ITEM7_P66_S2	Our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, working capital and debt obligations are as follows (in thousands):
21510_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933.
21510_14_ITEM7_P67_S1	The following summarizes our contractual obligations at September 27, 2014 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):
21510_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	Because of the uncertainty as to the timing of such payments, we have excluded cash payments related to our contractual obligations for our deferred compensation plans aggregating $29.4 million at September 27, 2014 .
21510_14_ITEM7_P68_S1	As of September 27, 2014 , we recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $23.7 million including gross interest and penalties of $1.8 million .
21510_14_ITEM7_P68_S2	As of September 28, 2013 , we recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $23.2 million including gross interest and penalties of $1.8 million .
21510_14_ITEM7_P68_S3	Both gross unrecognized tax benefits and gross interest and penalties are classified as non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
21510_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.
21510_14_ITEM7_P69_S1	As a result, these amounts are not included in the table above.
21510_14_ITEM7_P69_S2	Changes in financial condition Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2014 was $91.4 million , which included net income of $59.1 million , depreciation and amortization of $36.2 million and stock-based compensation expense of $18.9 million partially offset by cash used by operating assets and liabilities of $13.3 million , increases in net deferred tax assets of $8.2 million and $1.3 million other.
21510_14_ITEM7_P69_S3	Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2013 was $115.5 million, which included net income of $66.4 million, depreciation and amortization of $36.1 million, stock-based compensation expense of $18.9 million and $0.3 million other partially offset by cash used by operating assets and liabilities of $5.1 million and increases in net deferred tax assets of $1.1 million.
21510_14_ITEM7_P69_S4	Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2014 of $109.8 million included $22.8 million , net, used to acquire property and equipment and improve buildings net of proceeds from dispositions and $87.0 million net purchases of available-for-sale securities.
21510_14_ITEM7_P69_S5	Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2013 of $70.7 million included $20.5 million, net, used to acquire property and equipment and improve buildings and $67.3 million used to acquire Lumera and Innolight partially offset by $17.1 million net sales of available-for-sale securities.
21510_14_ITEM7_P69_S6	Cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2014 was $2.9 million , which included $10.7 million generated from our employee stock option and purchase plans partially offset by $7.8 million outflows due to net settlement of restricted stock.
21510_14_ITEM7_P69_S7	Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2013 was $11.7 million, including $24.0 million cash dividend on our common stock and $4.2 million due to net settlement of restricted stock partially offset by $16.5 million generated from our employee stock purchase plans.
21510_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	Changes in exchange rates in fiscal 2014 resulted in a decrease in cash balances of $3.7 million .
21510_14_ITEM7_P70_S1	Changes in exchange rates in fiscal 2013 resulted in a decrease in cash balances of $9.5 million.
21510_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 2.
21510_14_ITEM7_P71_S1	"Significant Accounting Policies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the respective dates of adoption or expected adoption and effects on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
21510_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.
21510_14_ITEM7_P72_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
21510_14_ITEM7_P72_S2	We have identified the following as the items that require the most significant judgment and often involve complex estimation: revenue recognition, accounting for long-lived assets (including goodwill and intangible assets), inventory valuation, warranty reserves, stock-based compensation and accounting for income taxes.
21510_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered or the service has been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable.
21510_14_ITEM7_P73_S1	Revenue from product sales is recorded when all of the foregoing conditions are met and risk of loss and title passes to the customer.
21510_14_ITEM7_P73_S2	Our products typically include a warranty and the estimated cost of product warranty claims (based on historical experience) is recorded at the time the sale is recognized.
21510_14_ITEM7_P73_S3	Sales to customers are generally not subject to any price protection or return rights.
21510_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	The majority of our sales are made to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), distributors, resellers and end-users in the non-scientific market.
21510_14_ITEM7_P74_S1	Sales made to these customers do not require installation of the products by us and are not subject to other post-delivery obligations, except in occasional instances where we have agreed to perform installation or provide training.
21510_14_ITEM7_P74_S2	In those instances, we defer revenue related to installation services or training until these services have been rendered.
21510_14_ITEM7_P74_S3	We allocate revenue from multiple element arrangements to the various elements based upon fair values or a selling price hierarchy, as more fully described in Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition," in our consolidated financial statements.
21510_14_ITEM7_P74_S4	Should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions, revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected.
21510_14_ITEM7_P74_S5	Failure to obtain anticipated orders due to delays or cancellations of orders could have a material adverse effect on our revenue.
21510_14_ITEM7_P74_S6	In addition, pressures from customers to reduce our prices or to modify our existing sales terms may have a material adverse effect on our revenue in future periods.
21510_14_ITEM7_P74_S7	Our sales to distributors, resellers and end-user customers typically do not have customer acceptance provisions and only certain of our sales to OEM customers and integrators have customer acceptance provisions.
21510_14_ITEM7_P74_S8	Customer acceptance is generally limited to performance under our published product specifications.
21510_14_ITEM7_P74_S9	For the few product sales that have customer acceptance provisions because of higher than published specifications, (1) the products are tested and accepted by the customer at our site or the customer accepts the results of our testing program prior to shipment to the customer, or (2) the revenue is deferred until customer acceptance occurs.
21510_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	Sales to end-users in the scientific market typically require installation and, thus, involve post-delivery obligations; however our post-delivery installation obligations are not essential to the functionality of our products.
21510_14_ITEM7_P75_S1	We defer revenue related to installation services until completion of these services.
21510_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	For most products, training is not provided; therefore, no post-delivery training obligation exists.
21510_14_ITEM7_P76_S1	However, when training is provided to our customers, it is typically priced separately and recognized as revenue as these services are provided.
21510_14_ITEM7_P76_S2	For multiple element arrangements which include extended maintenance contracts, we allocate and defer the amount of consideration equal to the separately stated price and recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
21510_14_ITEM7_P77_S0	Reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying values of the assets are impaired based on comparison to the undiscounted expected future cash flows identifiable to such long-lived and amortizable intangible assets.
21510_14_ITEM7_P77_S1	If the comparison indicates that impairment exists, the impaired asset is written down to its fair value.
21510_14_ITEM7_P78_S0	We have determined that our reporting units are the same as our operating segments as each constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results.
21510_14_ITEM7_P78_S1	We make this determination in a manner consistent with how the operating segments are managed.
21510_14_ITEM7_P78_S2	Based on this analysis, we have identified two reporting units which are our reportable segments: SLS and CLC.
21510_14_ITEM7_P79_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and written down when impaired (see Note 7 "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).
21510_14_ITEM7_P79_S1	We generally perform our annual impairment tests during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter, with any resulting impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.
21510_14_ITEM7_P79_S2	In our fiscal 2012 annual testing, we performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying amount.
21510_14_ITEM7_P79_S3	Based on our assessment, goodwill in the reporting units was not impaired as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.
21510_14_ITEM7_P79_S4	As such, it was not necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test at that time.
21510_14_ITEM7_P80_S0	In fiscal 2013, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test.
21510_14_ITEM7_P80_S1	This election was made because we had last performed this detailed impairment test in fiscal 2010 and we had subsequently added a substantial amount of goodwill balances as a result of our acquisitions of Midaz in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and the acquisitions of Innolight and Lumera in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.
21510_14_ITEM7_P80_S2	We performed our Step 1 test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and noted no impairment.
21510_14_ITEM7_P80_S3	Management completed and reviewed the results of the Step 1 analysis and concluded that a Step 2 analysis was not required as the estimated fair values of both of our reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values.
21510_14_ITEM7_P80_S4	Between the completion of that testing and the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we noted no indications of impairment or triggering events to cause us to review goodwill for potential impairment.
21510_14_ITEM7_P81_S0	In fiscal 2014, we conducted a qualitative assessment of the goodwill in the SLS reporting unit during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount.
21510_14_ITEM7_P81_S1	In assessing the qualitative factors, we considered the impact of these key factors: macroeconomic conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency, market and industry conditions, our operating and competitive environment, regulatory and political developments, the overall financial performance of our reporting units including cost factors and budgeted-to-actual revenue results.
21510_14_ITEM7_P81_S2	We also considered our market capitalization, stock price performance and the significant excess calculated in the prior year between estimated fair value and the carrying value of SLS.
21510_14_ITEM7_P81_S3	Based on our assessment, goodwill in the SLS reporting unit was not impaired as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.
21510_14_ITEM7_P81_S4	As such, it was not necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test at that time.
21510_14_ITEM7_P82_S0	For our CLC reporting unit we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment in fiscal 2014 and proceeded directly to performing the first step of goodwill impairment.
21510_14_ITEM7_P82_S1	The election was made in consideration of the lower financial performance of the reporting unit when compared to fiscal 2013, mostly due to softness in market conditions, predominantly in the advanced packaging market.
21510_14_ITEM7_P83_S0	We performed the Step 1 test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.
21510_14_ITEM7_P83_S1	We determined the fair value of the reporting unit for the Step 1 test using a 50-50% weighting of the Income (discounted cash flow) approach and Market (market comparable) approach.
21510_14_ITEM7_P84_S0	The Income approach utilizes the discounted cash flow model to provide an estimation of fair value based on the cash flows that a business expects to generate.
21510_14_ITEM7_P84_S1	These cash flows are based on forecasts developed internally by management which are then discounted at an after tax rate of return required by equity and debt market participants of a business enterprise.
21510_14_ITEM7_P84_S2	This rate of return or cost of capital is weighted based on the capitalization of comparable companies.
21510_14_ITEM7_P85_S0	The Market approach determines fair value by comparing the reporting units to comparable companies in similar lines of business that are publicly traded.
21510_14_ITEM7_P85_S1	Total Enterprise Value (TEV) multiples such as TEV to revenues and TEV to earnings (if applicable) before interest and taxes of the publicly traded companies are calculated.
21510_14_ITEM7_P85_S2	These multiples are then applied to the reporting unit's operating results to obtain an estimate of fair value.
21510_14_ITEM7_P85_S3	Each of these two approaches captures aspects of value in each reporting unit.
21510_14_ITEM7_P85_S4	The Income approach captures our expected future performance, and the Market approach captures how investors view the reporting units through other competitors.
21510_14_ITEM7_P85_S5	We believe these valuation approaches are proven valuation techniques and methodologies for our industry and are widely accepted by investors.
21510_14_ITEM7_P85_S6	As neither was perceived by us to deliver any greater indication of value than the other, and neither approach individually computed a fair value less than the carrying value of the segment, we weighted each of the approaches equally.
21510_14_ITEM7_P86_S0	At September 27, 2014 , we had $109.5 million of goodwill ($103.1 million in SLS and $6.4 million in CLC), $31.7 million of purchased intangible assets and $107.4 million of property and equipment on our consolidated balance sheet.
21510_14_ITEM7_P87_S0	Inventory Valuation We record our inventory at the lower of cost (computed on a first-in, first-out basis) or market.
21510_14_ITEM7_P87_S1	We write-down our inventory to its estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
21510_14_ITEM7_P87_S2	Inventory write-downs are generally recorded within guidelines set by management when the inventory for a device exceeds 12 months of its demand and when individual parts have been in inventory for greater than 12 months.
21510_14_ITEM7_P87_S3	If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required which could materially affect our future results of operations.
21510_14_ITEM7_P87_S4	Due to rapidly changing forecasts and orders, additional write-downs for excess or obsolete inventory, while not currently expected, could be required in the future.
21510_14_ITEM7_P87_S5	In the event that alternative future uses of fully written down inventories are identified, we may experience better than normal profit margins when such inventory is sold.
21510_14_ITEM7_P87_S6	Differences between actual results and previous estimates of excess and obsolete inventory could materially affect our future results of operations.
21510_14_ITEM7_P88_S0	We write-down our demo inventory by amortizing the cost of demo inventory over a twenty month period starting from the fourth month after such inventory is placed in service.
21510_14_ITEM7_P88_S1	We provide warranties on the majority of our product sales and allowances for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale.
21510_14_ITEM7_P88_S2	The determination of such allowances requires us to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty.
21510_14_ITEM7_P88_S3	We currently establish warranty reserves based on historical warranty costs for each product line.
21510_14_ITEM7_P88_S4	The weighted average warranty period covered is approximately 15 months.
21510_14_ITEM7_P88_S5	If actual return rates and/or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates, adjustments to cost of sales may be required in future periods.
21510_14_ITEM7_P89_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation using fair value.
21510_14_ITEM7_P89_S1	We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes Merton model and estimate the fair value of market-based performance restricted stock units granted using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
21510_14_ITEM7_P89_S2	We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.
21510_14_ITEM7_P89_S3	We amortize the fair value of stock options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods.
21510_14_ITEM7_P89_S4	We value service-based restricted stock units using the intrinsic value method and amortize the value on a straight-line basis over the restriction period.
21510_14_ITEM7_P89_S5	We value market-based performance restricted stock units using a Monte Carlo simulation model and amortize the value over the performance period, with no adjustment in future periods, based upon the actual shareholder return over the performance period.
21510_14_ITEM7_P90_S0	U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") requires the use of option pricing models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options.
21510_14_ITEM7_P91_S0	The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short-lived exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
21510_14_ITEM7_P91_S1	In addition, option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the options expected life, the expected price volatility of the underlying stock and an estimate of expected forfeitures.
21510_14_ITEM7_P92_S0	Our computation of expected volatility considers historical volatility and market-based implied volatility.
21510_14_ITEM7_P92_S1	Our estimate of expected forfeitures is based on historical employee data and could differ from actual forfeitures.
21510_14_ITEM7_P92_S2	See Note 12 "Employee Stock Award, Option and Benefit Plans" in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our stock-based employee compensation plans and the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of stock-based employee compensation.
21510_14_ITEM7_P93_S0	Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income tax provision (benefit) in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
21510_14_ITEM7_P93_S1	This process involves us estimating our current income tax provision (benefit) together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
21510_14_ITEM7_P93_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets.
21510_14_ITEM7_P94_S0	We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized.
21510_14_ITEM7_P95_S0	While we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made.
21510_14_ITEM7_P95_S1	Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.
21510_14_ITEM7_P96_S0	Federal and state income taxes have not been provided for on a portion of the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested.
21510_14_ITEM7_P96_S1	The total amount of unremitted earnings (including accumulated translation adjustments) of foreign subsidiaries for which we have not yet recorded federal and state income taxes was approximately $429.4 million at fiscal 2014 year-end.
21510_14_ITEM7_P96_S2	The amount of federal and state income taxes that would be payable upon repatriation of such earnings is not practicably determinable.
21510_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
21510_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
21510_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Interest rate sensitivity A portion of our investment portfolio is composed of fixed income securities.
21510_14_ITEM7A_P1_S1	These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase.
21510_14_ITEM7A_P1_S2	If interest rates were to increase immediately (whether due to changes in overall market rates or credit worthiness of the issuers of our individual securities) and uniformly by 10% from levels at fiscal 2014 year-end, the fair value of the portfolio, based on quoted market prices in active markets involving similar assets, would decline by an immaterial amount due to their short-term maturities.
21510_14_ITEM7A_P1_S3	We have the ability to generally hold our fixed income investments until maturity and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio.
21510_14_ITEM7A_P1_S4	If necessary, we may sell short-term investments prior to maturity to meet our liquidity needs.
21510_14_ITEM7A_P1_S5	At fiscal 2014 year-end, the fair value of our available-for-sale debt securities was $227.1 million , all of which was classified as short-term investments.
21510_14_ITEM7A_P1_S6	Gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities were $1.0 million and $(45,000) , respectively, at fiscal 2014 year-end.
21510_14_ITEM7A_P1_S7	At fiscal 2013 year-end, the fair value of our available-for-sale debt securities was $139.7 million, all of which was classified as short-term investments.
21510_14_ITEM7A_P1_S8	Gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities were $0.6 million and ($16,000), respectively, at fiscal 2013 year-end.
21510_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Foreign currency exchange risk We maintain operations in various countries outside of the United States and have foreign subsidiaries that manufacture and sell our products in various global markets.
21510_14_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The majority of our sales are transacted in U.S. dollars.
21510_14_ITEM7A_P2_S2	However, we do generate revenues in other currencies, primarily the Euro, Japanese Yen, the Korean Won and the Chinese Renminbi.
21510_14_ITEM7A_P2_S3	As a result, our earnings, cash flows and cash balances are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
21510_14_ITEM7A_P2_S4	We attempt to limit these exposures through financial market instruments.
21510_14_ITEM7A_P2_S5	We utilize derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts with maturities of three months or less, to manage our exposure associated with anticipated cash flows and net asset and liability positions denominated in foreign currencies.
21510_14_ITEM7A_P2_S6	Gains and losses on the forward contracts are mitigated by gains and losses on the underlying instruments.
21510_14_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
21510_14_ITEM7A_P3_S1	On occasion, we enter into currency forward exchange contracts to hedge specific anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions generally expected to occur within the next 12 months.
21510_14_ITEM7A_P3_S2	These cash flow hedges are designated for hedge accounting treatment and gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholder's equity and reclassified into earnings at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized in earnings.
21510_14_ITEM7A_P3_S3	See Note 6 "Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities".
21510_14_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments.
21510_14_ITEM7A_P4_S1	There can be no assurance that these strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately.
21510_14_ITEM7A_P4_S2	For example, the Japanese Yen, the Euro and the Korean Won have recently decreased in value.
21510_14_ITEM7A_P4_S3	While we model currency valuations and fluctuations, these may not ultimately be accurate.
21510_14_ITEM7A_P4_S4	If a financial counterparty to any of our hedging arrangements experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge, we may experience material financial losses.
21510_14_ITEM7A_P5_S0	In the current economic environment, the risk of failure of a financial party remains high.
21510_14_ITEM7A_P6_S0	At September 27, 2014 , approximately $201.3 million of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were held outside the U.S. in certain of our foreign operations, $67.9 million of which was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
21510_14_ITEM7A_P6_S1	A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency rates on our forward contracts would not have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
21510_14_ITEM7A_P7_S0	The following table provides information about our foreign exchange forward contracts at September 27, 2014 .
21510_14_ITEM7A_P7_S1	The table presents the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates, the value of the contracts in U.S. dollars at the contract exchange rate as of the contract maturity date and fair value.
21510_14_ITEM7A_P7_S2	The U.S. fair value represents the fair value of the contracts valued at September 27, 2014 rates.
21510_14_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Forward contracts to sell (buy) foreign currencies (in thousands, except contract rates):
21510_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by this annual report ("Evaluation Date").
21510_14_ITEM9A_P0_S1	The controls evaluation was done under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.
21510_14_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
21510_14_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the Company.
21510_14_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2014 , utilizing the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (1992).
21510_14_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on the assessment by management, we determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 27, 2014 .
21510_14_ITEM9A_P1_S3	The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2014 has been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears below.
21510_14_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Inherent Limitations Over Internal Controls Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
21510_14_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
21510_14_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
21510_14_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
21510_14_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
21510_14_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud.
21510_14_ITEM9A_P4_S0	A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
21510_14_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
21510_14_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
21510_14_ITEM9A_P4_S3	Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
21510_14_ITEM9A_P4_S4	There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 27, 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
21510_14_ITEM9A_P5_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Coherent, Inc.: We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Coherent, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") as of September 27, 2014 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
21510_14_ITEM9A_P5_S1	The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
21510_14_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
21510_14_ITEM9A_P5_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
21510_14_ITEM9A_P5_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
21510_14_ITEM9A_P5_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
21510_14_ITEM9A_P5_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
21510_14_ITEM9A_P6_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
21510_14_ITEM9A_P6_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
21510_14_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
21510_14_ITEM9A_P6_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
21510_14_ITEM9A_P6_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2014 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
21510_14_ITEM9A_P6_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 27, 2014 , of the Company and our report dated November 25, 2014, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

21510_14_ITEM15_P21_S3	The fiscal years of the majority of our international subsidiaries end on September 30.
21510_14_ITEM15_P21_S4	Accordingly, the financial statements of these subsidiaries as of that date and for the years then ended have been used for our consolidated financial statements.
21510_14_ITEM15_P21_S5	Management believes that the impact of the use of different year-ends is immaterial to our consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.
21510_14_ITEM15_P22_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
21510_14_ITEM15_P22_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
21510_14_ITEM15_P23_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Coherent, Inc. and its majority-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company", "we", "our", or "Coherent").

21510_14_ITEM15_P24_S0	The carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
21510_14_ITEM15_P25_S0	Short-term investments are comprised of available-for-sale securities, which are carried at fair value.
21510_14_ITEM15_P25_S1	Other non-current assets include trading securities and life insurance contracts related to our deferred compensation plans; trading securities are carried at fair value and life insurance contracts are carried at cash surrender values, which due to their ability to be converted to cash at that amount, approximate their fair values.
21510_14_ITEM15_P26_S0	Foreign exchange contracts are stated at fair value based on prevailing financial market information.
21510_14_ITEM15_P27_S0	Cash Equivalents All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.
21510_14_ITEM15_P28_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that may potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable.
21510_14_ITEM15_P28_S1	At fiscal 2014 year-end, the majority of our short-term investments are in US Treasury and federal agency obligations and corporate notes and obligations.
21510_14_ITEM15_P28_S2	Cash equivalents and short-term investments are maintained with several financial institutions and may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such balances.
21510_14_ITEM15_P28_S3	At September 27, 2014 , we held cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments outside the U.S. in certain of our foreign operations totaling approximately $201.3 million , $67.9 million of which was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
21510_14_ITEM15_P29_S0	The majority of our accounts receivable are derived from sales to customers for commercial applications.
21510_14_ITEM15_P29_S1	We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition and limit the amount of credit extended when deemed necessary but generally require no collateral.
21510_14_ITEM15_P29_S2	We maintain reserves for potential credit losses.

21510_14_ITEM15_P31_S0	Our primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate risk.
21510_14_ITEM15_P31_S1	Principal currencies hedged include the Euro, Korean Won, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Chinese Renminbi and Singapore dollar.
21510_14_ITEM15_P32_S0	Our derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value and are included in other current assets and other accrued liabilities.
21510_14_ITEM15_P32_S1	Our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments are based on whether they meet the criteria for designation as a cash flow hedge.
21510_14_ITEM15_P32_S2	Changes in the fair value of these cash flow hedges that are highly effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same line item on the consolidated statements of operations as the impact of the hedged transaction during the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
21510_14_ITEM15_P32_S3	The changes in fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges and the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges are recognized immediately in earnings in the line item on the consolidated statements of operations most closely associated with the related exposures, primarily in other income and expenses.
21510_14_ITEM15_P33_S0	Derivatives that we designate as cash flow hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the same section as the underlying item, primarily within cash flows from operating activities.
21510_14_ITEM15_P33_S1	We formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
21510_14_ITEM15_P34_S0	This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as cash-flow hedges to specific forecasted transactions.
21510_14_ITEM15_P34_S1	We also assess, both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items.
21510_14_ITEM15_P35_S0	Accounts Receivable Allowances Accounts receivable allowances reflect our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our accounts receivable balances.
21510_14_ITEM15_P35_S1	We regularly review allowances by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality, the age of the accounts receivable balances and current economic conditions that may affect a customer's ability to pay.
21510_14_ITEM15_P36_S0	Activity in accounts receivable allowance is as follows (in thousands):
21510_14_ITEM15_P37_S0	Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market.

21510_14_ITEM15_P39_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2.
21510_14_ITEM15_P40_S0	The fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.
21510_14_ITEM15_P40_S1	The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset.
21510_14_ITEM15_P40_S2	All of our existing asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return the property to its original condition upon lease termination at various sites and costs to clean up and dispose of certain fixed assets at our Sunnyvale, California site.
21510_14_ITEM15_P40_S3	We estimated that as of fiscal 2014 year-end, gross expected future cash flows of $2.4 million would be required to fulfill these obligations.
21510_14_ITEM15_P40_S4	The following table reconciles changes in our asset retirement liability for fiscal 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):
21510_14_ITEM15_P41_S0	At September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013 , the asset retirement liability is included in Other Long-term Liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
21510_14_ITEM15_P42_S0	Long-lived Assets We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, whenever events or changes in business circumstances or our planned use of long-lived assets indicate that their carrying amounts may not be fully recoverable or that their useful lives are no longer appropriate.
21510_14_ITEM15_P42_S1	Reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying values of long-lived assets are impaired based on a comparison to the undiscounted expected future net cash flows.
21510_14_ITEM15_P42_S2	If the comparison indicates that impairment exists, long-lived assets that are classified as held and used are written down to their respective fair values.
21510_14_ITEM15_P43_S0	When long-lived assets are classified as held for sale, they are written down to their respective fair values less costs to sell.
21510_14_ITEM15_P43_S1	Significant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that is used in the preparation of expected undiscounted cash flows.
21510_14_ITEM15_P43_S2	For fiscal years 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , there were no significant asset impairments recorded.
21510_14_ITEM15_P43_S3	Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and written down when impaired (see Note 7.

21510_14_ITEM15_P45_S0	reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
21510_14_ITEM15_P45_S1	Moreover, an entity can bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the impairment test, and then resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period.
21510_14_ITEM15_P46_S0	In fiscal 2012, we performed a qualitative assessment.
21510_14_ITEM15_P46_S1	In fiscal 2013, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test.
21510_14_ITEM15_P46_S2	This election was made because we had last performed this impairment test in fiscal 2010 and we have subsequently added a substantial amount of goodwill balances as a result of our acquisitions of Midaz in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and the acquisitions of Innolight and Lumera in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.
21510_14_ITEM15_P46_S3	We performed our Step 1 test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and noted no impairment.
21510_14_ITEM15_P46_S4	Between the completion of that testing and the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we noted no indications of impairment or triggering events to cause us to review goodwill for potential impairment.
21510_14_ITEM15_P46_S5	In our fiscal 2014 annual testing, we performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill for our SLS reporting unit (operating segment) using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and noted no impairment.
21510_14_ITEM15_P46_S6	For the CLC reporting unit (operating segment), we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test.
21510_14_ITEM15_P46_S7	This election was made because of the decline in fiscal 2014 reporting unit performance over fiscal 2013, mostly due to market softness predominantly in the advanced packaging market.
21510_14_ITEM15_P46_S8	We performed our Step 1 test using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and noted no impairment.
21510_14_ITEM15_P47_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets, including acquired existing technology, customer lists and trade name are amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of 1 year to 15 years.
21510_14_ITEM15_P47_S1	We provide warranties on the majority of our product sales and reserves for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale.
21510_14_ITEM15_P47_S2	The determination of such reserves requires us to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty.
21510_14_ITEM15_P47_S3	We currently establish warranty reserves based on historical warranty costs for each product line.
21510_14_ITEM15_P47_S4	The weighted average warranty period covered is approximately 15 months .
21510_14_ITEM15_P47_S5	If actual return rates and/or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates, adjustments to cost of sales may be required in future periods.
21510_14_ITEM15_P48_S0	Components of the reserve for warranty costs during fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 were as follows (in thousands):
21510_14_ITEM15_P49_S0	We are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business.
21510_14_ITEM15_P49_S1	We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset, or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies.
21510_14_ITEM15_P49_S2	An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.
21510_14_ITEM15_P49_S3	If we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined, then we disclose the range of the possible loss.
21510_14_ITEM15_P49_S4	We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted or a range of possible loss should be disclosed.
21510_14_ITEM15_P50_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2.
21510_14_ITEM15_P51_S0	When a sales arrangement contains multiple elements, such as products and/or services, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy.
21510_14_ITEM15_P51_S1	Using the selling price hierarchy, we determine the selling price of each deliverable using vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ), if it exists, and otherwise third-party evidence ( TPE ).
21510_14_ITEM15_P51_S2	If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exists, we use estimated selling price ( ESP ).
21510_14_ITEM15_P51_S3	We generally expect that we will not be able to establish TPE due to the nature of the markets in which we compete, and, as such, we typically will determine selling price using VSOE or if not available, ESP.
21510_14_ITEM15_P52_S0	Our basis for establishing VSOE of a deliverable's selling price consists of standalone sales transactions when the same or similar product or service is sold separately.
21510_14_ITEM15_P52_S1	However, when services are never sold separately, such as product installation services, VSOE is based on the product's estimated installation hours based on historical experience multiplied by the standard service billing rate.
21510_14_ITEM15_P53_S0	In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling price for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow price range, as defined by us.
21510_14_ITEM15_P53_S1	We also consider the geographies in which the products or services are sold, major product and service groups, and other environmental variables in determining VSOE.
21510_14_ITEM15_P53_S2	Absent the existence of VSOE and TPE, our determination of a deliverable's ESP involves evaluating several factors based on the specific facts and circumstances of these arrangements, which include pricing strategy and policies driven by geographies, market conditions, competitive landscape, correlation between proportionate selling price and list price established by management having the relevant authority, and other environmental variables in which the deliverable is sold.
21510_14_ITEM15_P54_S0	For multiple element arrangements which include extended maintenance contracts, we allocate and defer the amount of consideration equal to the separately stated price and recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
21510_14_ITEM15_P54_S1	We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered or the service has been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured.
21510_14_ITEM15_P54_S2	Revenue from product sales is recorded when all of the foregoing conditions are met and risk of loss and title passes to the customer.
21510_14_ITEM15_P54_S3	Sales to customers are generally not subject to any price protection or return rights.
21510_14_ITEM15_P55_S0	The majority of our sales are made to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), distributors, resellers and end-users in the non-scientific market.
21510_14_ITEM15_P55_S1	Sales made to these customers do not require installation of the products by us and are not subject to other post-delivery obligations, except in occasional instances where we have agreed to perform installation or provide training.
21510_14_ITEM15_P55_S2	In those instances, we defer revenue related to installation services or training until these services have been rendered.
21510_14_ITEM15_P55_S3	We allocate revenue from multiple element arrangements to the various elements based upon relative fair values.
21510_14_ITEM15_P55_S4	Our sales to distributors, resellers and end-user customers typically do not have customer acceptance provisions and only certain of our sales to OEM customers and integrators have customer acceptance provisions.
21510_14_ITEM15_P55_S5	Customer acceptance is generally limited to performance under our published product specifications.
21510_14_ITEM15_P55_S6	For the few product sales that have customer acceptance provisions because of higher than published specifications, (1) the products are tested and accepted by the customer at our site or the customer accepts the results of our testing program prior to shipment to the customer, or (2) the revenue is deferred until customer acceptance occurs.
21510_14_ITEM15_P56_S0	Sales to end-users in the scientific market typically require installation and, thus, involve post-delivery obligations; however, our post-delivery installation obligations are not essential to the functionality of our products.
21510_14_ITEM15_P56_S1	We defer revenue related to installation services until completion of these services.
21510_14_ITEM15_P57_S0	For most products, training is not provided; therefore, no post-delivery training obligation exists.
21510_14_ITEM15_P57_S1	However, when training is provided to our customers, it is typically priced separately and is recognized as revenue as these services are provided.
21510_14_ITEM15_P58_S0	We record taxes collected on revenue-producing activities on a net basis.
21510_14_ITEM15_P58_S1	Research and Development Research and development expenses include salaries, contractor and consultant fees, supplies and materials, as well as costs related to other overhead such as depreciation, facilities, utilities and other departmental expenses.
21510_14_ITEM15_P58_S2	The costs we incur with respect to internally developed technology and engineering services are included in research and development expenses as incurred as they do not directly relate to any particular licensee, license agreement or license fee.
21510_14_ITEM15_P58_S3	We treat third party and government funding of our research and development activity, where we are the primary beneficiary of such work conducted, as a reduction of research and development cost.

21510_14_ITEM15_P60_S0	reimbursements of $7.2 million , $1.7 million and $1.8 million were offset against research and development costs in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
21510_14_ITEM15_P61_S0	The functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are generally their respective local currencies.
21510_14_ITEM15_P61_S1	Accordingly, gains and losses from the translation of the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income ("OCI").
21510_14_ITEM15_P61_S2	Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in earnings.
21510_14_ITEM15_P62_S0	Comprehensive Income (Loss) Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources.
21510_14_ITEM15_P62_S1	Accumulated other comprehensive income (net of tax) at fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 year-ends are substantially comprised of accumulated translation adjustments of $35.3 million and $54.4 million, respectively.
21510_14_ITEM15_P63_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period, excluding unvested restricted stock.
21510_14_ITEM15_P63_S1	Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period increased by the effect of dilutive employee stock awards, including stock options, restricted stock awards and stock purchase contracts, using the treasury stock method.
21510_14_ITEM15_P63_S2	The following table presents information necessary to calculate basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share (in thousands, except per share data):
21510_14_ITEM15_P64_S0	A total of 47,242 ; 883 ; and 99,912 potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the dilutive share calculation for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively, as their effect was anti-dilutive.
21510_14_ITEM15_P65_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation using the fair value of the awards granted.
21510_14_ITEM15_P65_S1	We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes Merton model.
21510_14_ITEM15_P65_S2	We value restricted stock units using the intrinsic value method.
21510_14_ITEM15_P66_S0	We use a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the fair value of market-based performance restricted stock units.
21510_14_ITEM15_P66_S1	We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option and restricted stock unit forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those options and awards that are expected to vest.
21510_14_ITEM15_P66_S2	We amortize the fair value of stock options and awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods.
21510_14_ITEM15_P66_S3	See Note 12 "Employee Stock Award, Option and Benefit Plans" for a description of our stock-based employee compensation plans and the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of stock-based employee compensation.
21510_14_ITEM15_P67_S0	We record costs related to shipping and handling of revenue in Cost of Sales for all periods presented.
21510_14_ITEM15_P67_S1	Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are included in Net Sales.
21510_14_ITEM15_P67_S2	Custom duties billed to customers are recorded in Cost of Sales.
21510_14_ITEM15_P67_S3	Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were $2.9 million , $3.4 million and $3.5 million in fiscal 2014 , fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 , respectively.
21510_14_ITEM15_P68_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2.
21510_14_ITEM15_P69_S0	Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income tax provision (benefit) in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
21510_14_ITEM15_P69_S1	This process involves us estimating our current income tax provision (benefit) together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
21510_14_ITEM15_P69_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets.
21510_14_ITEM15_P70_S0	We account for uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740-10 Income Taxes , which creates a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.
21510_14_ITEM15_P70_S1	This standard provides a two-step approach for evaluating tax positions.
21510_14_ITEM15_P70_S2	The first step, recognition, occurs when a company concludes (based solely on the technical aspects of the matter) that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority.
21510_14_ITEM15_P70_S3	The second step, measurement, is only considered after step one has been satisfied and measures any tax benefit at the largest amount that is deemed more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the uncertainty.
21510_14_ITEM15_P70_S4	These determinations involve significant judgment by management.
21510_14_ITEM15_P70_S5	Tax positions that fail to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first subsequent interim period that they meet the more likely than not standard or when they are resolved through negotiation or litigation with factual interpretation, judgment and certainty.
21510_14_ITEM15_P71_S0	Tax laws and regulations themselves are complex and are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, evolution of regulations and court filings.
21510_14_ITEM15_P71_S1	Therefore, the actual liability for U.S. or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially to reverse previously recorded tax liabilities.
21510_14_ITEM15_P72_S0	We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized.
21510_14_ITEM15_P72_S1	While we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made.
21510_14_ITEM15_P72_S2	Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.
21510_14_ITEM15_P73_S0	Federal and state income taxes have not been provided for on a portion of the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested.
21510_14_ITEM15_P73_S1	The total amount of unremitted earnings (including accumulated translation adjustments) of foreign subsidiaries for which we have not yet recorded federal and state income taxes was approximately $429.4 million at fiscal 2014 year-end.
21510_14_ITEM15_P73_S2	The amount of federal and state income taxes that would be payable upon repatriation of such earnings is not practicably determinable.
21510_14_ITEM15_P74_S0	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the FASB amended the Accounting Standards Codification and created a new Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
21510_14_ITEM15_P74_S1	The new guidance establishes a single comprehensive contract-based model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers.
21510_14_ITEM15_P74_S2	The new model significantly changes existing GAAP, requires substantial judgment in its application, and will generally require companies to make more disclosures about revenue.
21510_14_ITEM15_P75_S0	The core principle of the amendment is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
21510_14_ITEM15_P75_S1	In applying the new guidance, an entity will (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the contract s performance obligations; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
21510_14_ITEM15_P76_S0	The new standard provides for two alternative implementation methods.
21510_14_ITEM15_P76_S1	The first is to apply the new standard retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented.
21510_14_ITEM15_P76_S2	This method does allow the use of certain practical expedients.
21510_14_ITEM15_P76_S3	The second method is to apply the new standard retrospectively in the year of initial adoption and record a cumulative effect adjustment for the impact of adjusting contracts open at the date of adoption.
21510_14_ITEM15_P76_S4	Under this transition method, we would apply this guidance retrospectively only to contracts that are not completed contracts at the date of initial application.
21510_14_ITEM15_P76_S5	We would then recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings.
21510_14_ITEM15_P76_S6	This method also requires us to disclose comparative information for the year of adoption.
21510_14_ITEM15_P76_S7	We will adopt the FASB s amended guidance for our fiscal year beginning October 1, 2017; early adoption is not permitted.
21510_14_ITEM15_P76_S8	We are currently evaluating the new guidance and have not determined the impact this standard may have on our financial statements nor have we decided upon the method of adoption.
21510_14_ITEM15_P77_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2.
21510_14_ITEM15_P78_S0	In July 2013, the FASB issued amended guidance that resolves the diversity in practice for the presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists.
21510_14_ITEM15_P78_S1	This new accounting guidance requires the netting of unrecognized tax benefits ("UTBs") against a deferred tax asset for a loss or other carryforward that would apply in settlement of the uncertain tax positions.
21510_14_ITEM15_P78_S2	Under the new standard, UTBs will be netted against all available same-jurisdiction losses or other tax carryforwards that would be utilized, rather than only against carryforwards that are created by the UTBs.
21510_14_ITEM15_P78_S3	The new standard requires prospective adoption but allows retrospective adoption for all periods presented.
21510_14_ITEM15_P78_S4	We will adopt the FASB s amended guidance for our fiscal year beginning September 28, 2014.
21510_14_ITEM15_P78_S5	We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

21510_14_ITEM15_P81_S0	Our allocation of the purchase price is as follows (in thousands):
21510_14_ITEM15_P82_S0	Results of operations for the business have been included in our consolidated financial statements subsequent to the date of acquisition and pro forma results of operations in accordance with authoritative guidance for prior periods have not been presented because the effect of the acquisition was not material to our prior period consolidated financial results.
21510_14_ITEM15_P83_S0	None of the goodwill from this purchase is deductible for tax purposes.
21510_14_ITEM15_P84_S0	The identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over their respective useful lives o f less than one to six years.
21510_14_ITEM15_P85_S0	Acquired IPR D assets are initially recognized at fair value and are classified as indefinite-lived assets until the successful completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts.
21510_14_ITEM15_P85_S1	The value assigned to IPR D was determined by considering the value of the products under development to the overall development plan, estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows to their present value.

21510_14_ITEM15_P90_S2	Innolight has been included in our Specialty Lasers and Systems segment.
21510_14_ITEM15_P91_S0	Our allocation of the purchase price is as follows (in thousands):
21510_14_ITEM15_P92_S0	Results of operations for the business have been included in our consolidated financial statements subsequent to the date of acquisition and pro forma results of operations in accordance with authoritative guidance for prior periods have not been presented because the effect of the acquisition was not material to our prior period consolidated financial results.
21510_14_ITEM15_P93_S0	None of the goodwill from this purchase is deductible for tax purposes.
21510_14_ITEM15_P94_S0	The identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over their respective useful lives of six to seven years.
21510_14_ITEM15_P95_S0	IPR D consists of two projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility.
21510_14_ITEM15_P95_S1	The projects have not been completed as of September 27, 2014 .
21510_14_ITEM15_P96_S0	We expensed $0.2 million of acquisition-related costs as selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations for our fiscal year 2013.
21510_14_ITEM15_P97_S0	We measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value.
21510_14_ITEM15_P97_S1	The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets.
21510_14_ITEM15_P97_S2	Level 1 valuations are obtained from real-time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets.
21510_14_ITEM15_P97_S3	Level 2 valuations are obtained from quoted market prices in active markets involving similar assets; these instruments, which mature within one year and are issued by counterparties with high credit ratings, include U.S. Treasury and international government obligations, investment-grade corporate bonds, certificates of deposit and commercial paper.
21510_14_ITEM15_P97_S4	Level 3 valuations would be based on unobservable inputs to a valuation model and include our own data about assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available under the circumstances; as of September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013 , we did not have any assets or liabilities valued based on Level 3 valuations.
21510_14_ITEM15_P98_S0	Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013 are summarized below (in thousands):

21510_14_ITEM15_P101_S1	The market inputs used to value these instruments generally consist of market yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.
21510_14_ITEM15_P101_S2	Pricing sources include industry standard data providers, security master files from large financial institutions, and other third party sources which are input into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine a daily market value.
21510_14_ITEM15_P101_S3	This creates a consensus price or a weighted average price for each security.
21510_14_ITEM15_P101_S4	(7) The principal market in which we execute our foreign currency contracts is the institutional market in an over-the-counter environment with a relatively high level of price transparency.
21510_14_ITEM15_P101_S5	The market participants usually are large commercial banks.
21510_14_ITEM15_P102_S0	Our foreign currency contracts valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and quoted pricing intervals from public data sources and do not involve management judgment.
21510_14_ITEM15_P103_S0	(8) The fair value of mutual funds is determined based on quoted market prices.
21510_14_ITEM15_P103_S1	Securities traded on a national exchange are stated at the last reported sales price on the day of valuation; other securities traded in over-the-counter market and listed securities for which no sale was reported on that date are stated as the last quoted bid price.
21510_14_ITEM15_P104_S0	SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS We consider all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.

21510_14_ITEM15_P109_S1	We enter into foreign exchange forwards to minimize the risks of foreign currency fluctuation of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet; these are not designated as hedging instruments.
21510_14_ITEM15_P109_S2	Our derivative contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features and do not require collateral or other security to be furnished by us or the counterparties.
21510_14_ITEM15_P110_S0	We maintain operations in various countries outside of the United States and have foreign subsidiaries that manufacture and sell our products in various global markets.
21510_14_ITEM15_P110_S1	The majority of our sales are transacted in U.S. dollars.
21510_14_ITEM15_P110_S2	However, we do generate revenues in other currencies, primarily the Euro, Japanese Yen (JPY), Korean Won and Chinese Renminbi (RMB).
21510_14_ITEM15_P110_S3	As a result, our earnings, cash flows and cash balances are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
21510_14_ITEM15_P110_S4	We attempt to limit these exposures through financial market instruments.
21510_14_ITEM15_P110_S5	We utilize derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts with maturities of three months or less, to manage our exposure associated with anticipated cash flows and net asset and liability positions denominated in foreign currencies.
21510_14_ITEM15_P110_S6	Gains and losses on the forward contracts are mitigated by gains and losses on the underlying instruments.
21510_14_ITEM15_P111_S0	We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
21510_14_ITEM15_P111_S1	If a financial counterparty to any of our hedging arrangements experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge, we may experience material financial losses.
21510_14_ITEM15_P112_S0	For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense).
21510_14_ITEM15_P113_S0	Cash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of the hedge when we enter into contracts for specific future transactions.
21510_14_ITEM15_P113_S1	Cash flow hedges are evaluated for effectiveness quarterly.
21510_14_ITEM15_P114_S0	The effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is reported as a component of OCI in stockholder's equity and is reclassified into earnings when the underlying transaction affects earnings.
21510_14_ITEM15_P114_S1	The majority of the after-tax net income or loss related to derivative instruments included in OCI at September 27, 2014 is expected to be reclassified into earnings within 12 months.
21510_14_ITEM15_P115_S0	Changes in the fair value of currency forward contracts due to changes in time value are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness and recognized in other income (expense) as incurred.
21510_14_ITEM15_P116_S0	We classify the cash flows from the foreign exchange forward contracts that are accounted for as cash flow hedges in the same section as the underlying item, primarily within cash flows from operating activities.

21510_14_ITEM15_P120_S2	The German subsidiary designates these hedge contracts as cash flow hedges under ASC 815.
21510_14_ITEM15_P121_S0	The fair values of our derivative instruments are included in prepaid expenses and other assets and in other current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets (see Note 4); such amounts were not material as of September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013 .

21510_14_ITEM15_P123_S0	The amounts that will be reclassified from AOCI to earnings will generally be offset by the recognition of the hedged transactions (e.g., anticipated sales) in earnings, thereby achieving the realization of prices contemplated by the underlying risk management strategies and will vary from the expected amounts presented above as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates.
21510_14_ITEM15_P124_S0	To mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions, we enter into master netting arrangements that allow each counterparty in the arrangements to net settle amounts of multiple and separate derivative transactions under certain conditions.
21510_14_ITEM15_P124_S1	We present the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities within the Company's consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis even when derivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation.
21510_14_ITEM15_P124_S2	Our derivative contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features and do not require collateral or other security to be furnished by us or the counterparties.

21510_14_ITEM15_P128_S0	GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have occurred, and we write down these assets when impaired.
21510_14_ITEM15_P128_S1	We perform our annual impairment tests during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter, with any resulting impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.
21510_14_ITEM15_P129_S0	Coherent has two reporting units: Specialty Laser Systems and Commercial Lasers and Components.
21510_14_ITEM15_P130_S0	In our fiscal 2014 annual testing, we performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill for our SLS reporting unit (operating segment) during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount.

21510_14_ITEM15_P132_S1	We also considered our market capitalization, stock price performance and the significant excess between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the SLS segment.
21510_14_ITEM15_P132_S2	Based on our assessment, goodwill in the SLS reporting unit was not impaired as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.
21510_14_ITEM15_P132_S3	As such, it was not necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test at that time.
21510_14_ITEM15_P132_S4	For the CLC reporting unit (operating segment), we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test.
21510_14_ITEM15_P132_S5	This election was made because of the decline in fiscal 2014 reporting unit performance over fiscal 2013, mostly due to market softness predominantly in the advanced packaging market.
21510_14_ITEM15_P132_S6	We performed our Step 1 test using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and noted no impairment.
21510_14_ITEM15_P132_S7	We determined the fair value of the CLC reporting unit for the Step 1 test using a 50-50% weighting of the Income (discounted cash flow) approach and Market (market comparable) approach.
21510_14_ITEM15_P132_S8	Management completed and reviewed the results of the Step 1 analysis and concluded that a Step 2 analysis was not required as the estimated fair value of the CLC reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value.
21510_14_ITEM15_P132_S9	Between the completion of that testing and the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we noted no indications of impairment or triggering events with either reporting unit to cause us to review goodwill for potential impairment.
21510_14_ITEM15_P133_S0	The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment for fiscal 2014 and 2013 are as follows (in thousands):
21510_14_ITEM15_P134_S0	(1) Gross amount of goodwill for our CLC segment was $25.7 million at September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013 .
21510_14_ITEM15_P134_S1	At both September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013 , the accumulated impairment loss for the CLC segment was $19.3 million reflecting an impairment charge in fiscal 2009.
21510_14_ITEM15_P134_S2	(2) The gross amount of goodwill for our SLS segment was $105.5 million and $109.4 million at September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013 .
21510_14_ITEM15_P134_S3	At both September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013 , the accumulated impairment loss for the SLS segment was $2.4 million reflecting an impairment charge in fiscal 2003.
21510_14_ITEM15_P135_S0	We evaluate long-lived assets and amortizable intangible assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances or our planned use of assets indicate that their carrying amounts may not be fully recoverable or that their useful lives are no longer appropriate.
21510_14_ITEM15_P135_S1	Reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying values of assets are impaired based on comparison to the undiscounted expected future cash flows identifiable to such long-lived and amortizable intangible assets.
21510_14_ITEM15_P135_S2	If the comparison indicates that impairment exists, the impaired asset is written down to its fair value.
21510_14_ITEM15_P136_S0	During the year ended fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012, we did not have any impairment of intangible assets as a result of the impairment analysis.

21510_14_ITEM15_P167_S0	We have a stock plan for which employees and non-employee directors are eligible participants.
21510_14_ITEM15_P167_S1	This plan is the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2011 Plan") which includes our options, time-based restricted stock units and market-based performance restricted stock units.
21510_14_ITEM15_P167_S2	In prior years, we have had a stock plan for which employees and service providers were eligible participants and a non-employee Directors' Stock Option Plan for which only non-employee directors were eligible participants.
21510_14_ITEM15_P168_S0	Under the 2011 Plan, Coherent may grant options and awards (time-based restricted stock units and market-based performance restricted stock units) to purchase up to 6,747,691 shares of common stock, of which 5,746,365 shares remain available for grant at fiscal 2014 year end.
21510_14_ITEM15_P168_S1	Employee options are generally exercisable between two and four years from the grant date at a price equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the grant and generally vest 25% to 50% annually.

21510_14_ITEM15_P169_S4	New directors now initially receive an award of restricted stock units of 3,500 shares which vest over a two year period.
21510_14_ITEM15_P169_S5	Beginning with the annual meeting of stockholders in 2011 , the annual grant for non-employee directors became 3,500 shares of restricted stock units that vest on February 15 of the calendar year following the grant.
21510_14_ITEM15_P170_S0	Restricted stock awards and restricted stock units are typically subject to vesting restrictions either time-based or performance-based conditions for vesting.
21510_14_ITEM15_P170_S1	Until restricted stock vests, shares (including those issuable upon vesting of the applicable restricted stock unit) are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the release of restrictions and cannot be transferred.
21510_14_ITEM15_P171_S0	The service based restricted stock awards generally vest three years from the date of grant.
21510_14_ITEM15_P172_S0	The service based restricted stock unit awards are generally subject to annual vesting over three years from the date of grant.
21510_14_ITEM15_P173_S0	The market-based performance restricted stock unit award grants are generally either subject to annual vesting over three years from the date of grant or subject to a single vest measurement three years from the date of grant, depending upon achievement of performance measurements based on the performance of the Company's total shareholder returns (as defined in the plan) compared with the performance of the Russell 2000 Index.
21510_14_ITEM15_P173_S1	We recognize compensation expense for all share-based payment awards based on the fair value of such awards.
21510_14_ITEM15_P173_S2	The expense is recognized on a straight-line basis per tranche over the respective requisite service period of the awards.
21510_14_ITEM15_P174_S0	Determining Fair Value Stock Options Valuation and amortization method We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing formula and a single option award approach.
21510_14_ITEM15_P174_S1	This fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period.
21510_14_ITEM15_P174_S2	The expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and was determined based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock-based awards, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior as influenced by changes to the terms of its stock-based awards.
21510_14_ITEM15_P174_S3	Our process for computing expected volatility considers both historical volatility and market-based implied volatility; however our estimate of expected forfeitures is based on historical employee data and could differ from actual forfeitures.
21510_14_ITEM15_P175_S0	The risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation method is based on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term.

21510_14_ITEM15_P178_S0	The Company did not grant any stock options in fiscal 2014 or fiscal 2013 .
21510_14_ITEM15_P178_S1	The fair values of shares purchased under the employee stock purchase plan for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 were estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:
21510_14_ITEM15_P179_S0	Time-Based Restricted Stock Units Time-based restricted stock units are fair valued at the closing market price on the date of grant.
21510_14_ITEM15_P179_S1	Market-Based Performance Restricted Stock Units We grant market-based performance restricted stock units to officers and certain employees.
21510_14_ITEM15_P179_S2	The performance stock unit agreements provide for the award of performance stock units with each unit representing the right to receive one share of Coherent, Inc. common stock to be issued after the applicable award period.
21510_14_ITEM15_P179_S3	The final number of units awarded for this grant will be determined as of the vesting dates, based upon our total shareholder return over the performance period compared to the Russell 2000 Index and could range from a minimum of no units to a maximum of twice the initial award.
21510_14_ITEM15_P179_S4	The weighted average fair value for these performance units was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model incorporating the following weighted average assumptions:
21510_14_ITEM15_P180_S0	We recognize the estimated cost of these awards, as determined under the simulation model, over the related service period, with no adjustment in future periods based upon the actual shareholder return over the performance period.
21510_14_ITEM15_P180_S1	The following table shows total stock-based compensation expense included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 (in thousands):

21510_14_ITEM15_P182_S2	Management has made an estimate of expected forfeitures and is recognizing compensation costs only for those equity awards expected to vest.
21510_14_ITEM15_P182_S3	At fiscal 2014 year-end, the total compensation cost related to unvested stock-based awards granted to employees under the Company's stock option and award plans but not yet recognized was approximately $16.9 million , net of estimated forfeitures of $0.7 million .
21510_14_ITEM15_P182_S4	This cost will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.4 years and will be adjusted for subsequent changes in estimated forfeitures.
21510_14_ITEM15_P182_S5	At fiscal 2014 year-end, the total compensation cost related to options to purchase common shares under the ESPP but not yet recognized was approximately $0.2 million .
21510_14_ITEM15_P182_S6	This cost will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately one month.
21510_14_ITEM15_P183_S0	The stock option exercise tax benefits reported in the statement of cash flows results from the excess tax benefits arising from tax deductions in excess of the stock-based compensation cost recognized, determined on a grant-by-grant basis.
21510_14_ITEM15_P183_S1	During fiscal 2014 and 2013 , we have not generated any excess tax benefits as cash flows from financing activities.
21510_14_ITEM15_P183_S2	During fiscal 2012 we recorded approximately $1.3 million of excess tax benefits as cash flows from financing activities.
21510_14_ITEM15_P183_S3	The following is a summary of option activity for our Stock Option Plans for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 (in thousands, except per share amounts and remaining contractual term in years):

21510_14_ITEM15_P187_S0	__________________________________________ (1) Service-based restricted stock vested during each fiscal year (2) Performance-based awards and units included at 100% of target goal; under the terms of the awards, the recipient may earn between 0% and 200% of the award.
21510_14_ITEM15_P188_S0	Restricted Stock Units are converted into the right to receive common stock upon vesting; prior to issuance, the Company permits the holders to satisfy their tax withholding requirements by net settlement, whereby the Company withholds a portion of the shares to cover the applicable taxes based on the fair market value of the Company's stock at the vesting date.
21510_14_ITEM15_P188_S1	The number of shares withheld to cover tax payments was 118,000 in fiscal 2014 , 95,000 in fiscal 2013 and 90,000 in fiscal 2012 ; tax payments made were $7.8 million , $4.2 million and $4.5 million , respectively.

21510_14_ITEM15_P194_S0	Coherent Korea received the final approval for a High-Tech tax exemption in 2013 from the Korean authorities and it is subject to capital contribution limitations.
21510_14_ITEM15_P194_S1	The impact of this tax exemption decreased Korean income taxes by approximately $2.4 million in fiscal 2014.
21510_14_ITEM15_P194_S2	The benefit of the tax holiday on fiscal 2014 net income per share (diluted) was $0.10 .
21510_14_ITEM15_P195_S0	Coherent Singapore had previously received a Pioneer Status tax exemption from the Singapore authorities effective from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2017, and it may be extended if certain additional requirements are satisfied.
21510_14_ITEM15_P196_S0	The tax holiday is conditional upon our meeting certain revenue, business spending and employment thresholds.
21510_14_ITEM15_P197_S0	Although Coherent Singapore had income in fiscal 2014, this amount was largely offset by a loss carryforward from fiscal 2012.
21510_14_ITEM15_P197_S1	The benefit of the Singapore tax holiday in fiscal 2014 net of the loss carryforward is therefore not significant.
21510_14_ITEM15_P198_S0	The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in thousands):
21510_14_ITEM15_P199_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 14.
21510_14_ITEM15_P200_S0	In determining our fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 tax provisions under ASC Subtopic 740, we calculated the deferred tax assets and liabilities for each separate tax entity.
21510_14_ITEM15_P200_S1	We then considered a number of factors including the positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of our deferred tax assets to determine whether a valuation allowance should be recognized with respect to our deferred tax assets.
21510_14_ITEM15_P200_S2	We determined that a valuation allowance was appropriate for a portion of the deferred tax assets of our California research and development tax credits, foreign tax attributes, and net operating losses at fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 year-ends.
21510_14_ITEM15_P200_S3	During fiscal 2014 , we increased our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by $1.0 million to $14.4 million , primarily due to the reduced ability to utilize California and other states research and development tax credits.
21510_14_ITEM15_P201_S0	The net deferred tax asset is classified on the consolidated balance sheets as follows (in thousands):
21510_14_ITEM15_P202_S0	We have various tax attribute carryforwards which include the following:
21510_14_ITEM15_P203_S0	Foreign net operating loss carryforwards are $25.2 million , of which $23.5 million have no expiration date and of which $1.6 million are scheduled to expire beginning in fiscal year 2030 .
21510_14_ITEM15_P203_S1	A valuation allowance totaling $9.7 million has been provided against the foreign net operating loss carryforwards in certain jurisdictions since the recovery of the carryforwards are uncertain.
21510_14_ITEM15_P203_S2	California net operating loss carryforwards are $15.7 million and are scheduled to expire in fiscal years 2022 to 2032.
21510_14_ITEM15_P203_S3	The tax benefit relating to approximately $6.1 million of the state net operating loss carryforwards will be credited to additional paid-in-capital when recognized.

21510_14_ITEM15_P206_S1	The tax benefit relating to approximately $10.7 million of the federal foreign tax credit carryforwards will be credited to additional paid-in-capital when recognized.
21510_14_ITEM15_P207_S0	We are subject to taxation and file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions.
21510_14_ITEM15_P207_S1	For U.S. federal income tax purposes, all years prior to 2011 are closed.
21510_14_ITEM15_P207_S2	In our major foreign jurisdictions and our major state jurisdictions, the years prior to 2006 and 2010, respectively, are closed to examination.
21510_14_ITEM15_P207_S3	Earlier years in our various jurisdictions may remain open for adjustment to the extent that we have tax attribute carryforwards from those years.
21510_14_ITEM15_P207_S4	We believe that we have provided adequate reserves for any adjustments that may be determined by the tax authorities.
21510_14_ITEM15_P207_S5	A reconciliation of the change in gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, is as follows (in thousands):
21510_14_ITEM15_P208_S0	As of September 27, 2014 , the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits including gross interest and penalties was $23.7 million , of which $15.8 million , if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate.
21510_14_ITEM15_P208_S1	Our total gross unrecognized tax benefit was classified as long-term taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheets.
21510_14_ITEM15_P208_S2	We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes.
21510_14_ITEM15_P208_S3	As of September 27, 2014 , the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $1.8 million and it is classified as long-term taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheets.
21510_14_ITEM15_P208_S4	As of September 28, 2013 , we had accrued $1.8 million for the gross interest and penalties related to the gross unrecognized tax benefits.
21510_14_ITEM15_P208_S5	Management believes that it has adequately provided for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.
21510_14_ITEM15_P209_S0	The Company regularly engages in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions.
21510_14_ITEM15_P209_S1	It is reasonably possible that certain federal, foreign and state tax matters may be concluded in the next 12 months.
21510_14_ITEM15_P209_S2	Although the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that the balance of net unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties could be reduced by up to approximately $2.5 million in the next 12 months.
21510_14_ITEM15_P209_S3	A summary of the fiscal tax years that remain subject to examination, as of September 27, 2014 , for our major tax jurisdictions is:

21510_14_ITEM15_P211_S0	SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION We are organized into two reportable operating segments: Specialty Lasers and Systems ("SLS") and Commercial Lasers and Components ("CLC").
21510_14_ITEM15_P212_S0	This segmentation reflects the go-to-market strategies for various products and markets.
21510_14_ITEM15_P212_S1	While both segments work to deliver cost-effective solutions, SLS develops and manufacturers configurable, advanced-performance products largely serving the microelectronics, scientific research and government programs and OEM components and instrumentation markets.
21510_14_ITEM15_P212_S2	The size and complexity of many of our SLS products require service to be performed at the customer site by factory-trained field service engineers.
21510_14_ITEM15_P213_S0	CLC focuses on higher volume products that are offered in set configurations.
21510_14_ITEM15_P213_S1	The product architectures are designed for easy exchange at the point of use such that product service and repairs are based upon advanced replacement and depot (i.e., factory) repair.
21510_14_ITEM15_P214_S0	CLC's primary markets include materials processing, OEM components and instrumentation and microelectronics.
21510_14_ITEM15_P215_S0	We have identified SLS and CLC as operating segments for which discrete financial information is available.
21510_14_ITEM15_P215_S1	Both units have dedicated engineering, manufacturing, product business management and product line management functions.
21510_14_ITEM15_P216_S0	A small portion of our outside revenue is attributable to projects and recently developed products for which a segment has not yet been determined.
21510_14_ITEM15_P217_S0	The associated direct and indirect costs are presented in the category of Corporate and other, along with other corporate costs as described below.
21510_14_ITEM15_P218_S0	Our Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the chief operating decision maker (CODM) as he assesses the performance of the segments and decides how to allocate resources to the segments.
21510_14_ITEM15_P218_S1	Income (loss) from operations is the measure of profit and loss that our CODM uses to assess performance and make decisions.
21510_14_ITEM15_P218_S2	As assets are not a measure used to assess the performance of the company by the CODM, asset information is not tracked or compiled by segment and is not available to be reported in our disclosures.
21510_14_ITEM15_P219_S0	Income (loss) from operations represents the net sales less the cost of sales and direct operating expenses incurred within the operating segments as well as allocated expenses such as shared sales and manufacturing costs.
21510_14_ITEM15_P219_S1	We do not allocate to our operating segments certain operating expenses which we manage separately at the corporate level.
21510_14_ITEM15_P219_S2	These unallocated costs include stock-based compensation and corporate functions (certain research and development, management, finance, legal and human resources) and are included in the results below under Corporate and other in the reconciliation of operating results.
21510_14_ITEM15_P219_S3	Management does not consider unallocated Corporate and other costs in its measurement of segment performance.

21510_14_ITEM15_P226_S1	There was one other customer who accounted for 11% of consolidated revenues for fiscal 2012 .
21510_14_ITEM15_P226_S2	These customers purchased primarily from our SLS segment.
21510_14_ITEM15_P227_S0	QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) Summarized quarterly financial data for the years ended September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013 are as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):
21510_14_ITEM15_P228_S0	All other exhibits required to be filed as part of this report have been incorporated by reference.
21510_14_ITEM15_P228_S1	See item 15 for a complete index of such exhibits.
21510_14_ITEM15_P229_S0	The Company hereby grants to the Employee an award of Restricted Stock Units ( RSUs ), as set forth in the Notice of Grant, subject to the terms and conditions in this Agreement and in the Company's 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan ).
21510_14_ITEM15_P229_S1	Initially capitalized terms herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Plan or as defined herein, as applicable.
21510_14_ITEM15_P230_S0	Each RSU represents the right to receive a Share on the vesting date.
21510_14_ITEM15_P230_S1	Unless and until the RSUs vest, the Employee will have no right to receive Shares under such RSUs.
21510_14_ITEM15_P230_S2	Prior to actual distribution of Shares pursuant to any vested RSUs, such RSUs will represent an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable (if at all) only from the general assets of the Company.
21510_14_ITEM15_P231_S0	Vesting Schedule; Assumption or Substitution Calculation .
21510_14_ITEM15_P231_S1	The RSUs shall vest as follows:
21510_14_ITEM15_P232_S0	Up to the Maximum Amount will vest and be settled, based upon the extent, if any, to which the performance metric has been achieved.
21510_14_ITEM15_P233_S0	The performance metric is the relative performance of Company stock against the Russell 2000 index over a three-year period, with the target Company stock performance equivalent to the performance of the Russell 2000 index over such period.
21510_14_ITEM15_P233_S1	To determine relative performance, the baseline metrics are the 90 trading day average closing price of the Company and the Russell 2000 Index, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, or such other reliable source as is determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion, with the last of the 90 trading days falling on November 14, 2012.
21510_14_ITEM15_P233_S2	This 90 day average establishes both the Company baseline stock price (the Company Baseline Stock Price ) and the Russell 2000 Index baseline (the Russell 2000 Baseline ) against which future Company stock and Russell 2000 Index performance will be compared.
21510_14_ITEM15_P234_S0	Next, the Company will measure the 90 trading day average closing price of the Company and the Russell 2000 Index, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, or such other reliable source as is determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion, with the last trading day of such 90-trading day period ending on November 13, 2015 (establishing both the Company Closing Price and the Russell 2000 Index Closing Price ).
21510_14_ITEM15_P235_S0	The Company will then measure Company performance by dividing the Company Closing Price by the Company Baseline Stock Price, with the quotient expressed as a percentage of the Company Baseline Stock Price (the Company Percentage Performance ).
21510_14_ITEM15_P235_S1	The Company will then measure Russell 2000 Index Performance over the same period by dividing the Russell 2000 Index Closing Price by the Russell 2000 Index Baseline with the quotient expressed as a percentage of the Russell 2000 Index Baseline (the Russell 2000 Index Percentage Performance ).
21510_14_ITEM15_P236_S0	The Company will then subtract the Russell 2000 Index Percentage Performance from the Company Percentage Performance, then add 100 to the result, with the final result constituting the relative Company performance as a percentage (the Relative Performance Percentage ).
21510_14_ITEM15_P237_S0	If the Relative Performance Percentage is 50% or less, no RSUs shall vest.
21510_14_ITEM15_P237_S1	If the Relative Performance Percentage equals 51%, then 2% of the Target Amount shall vest.
21510_14_ITEM15_P237_S2	If the Relative Performance Percentage equals 70%, then 40% of the Target Amount shall vest.
21510_14_ITEM15_P237_S3	If the Relative Performance Percentage equals 100%, then the Target Amount shall vest.
21510_14_ITEM15_P237_S4	If the Relative Performance Percentage equals 150% or more, then 200% of the Target Amount shall vest (i.e., the Maximum Amount shall vest).

21510_15_ITEM1_P0_S0	Business Overview Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30.
21510_15_ITEM1_P0_S1	Fiscal years 2015 , 2014 and 2013 ended on October 3 , September 27 , and September 28 , respectively, and are referred to in this annual report as fiscal 2015 , fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 for convenience.
21510_15_ITEM1_P0_S2	Fiscal year 2015 included 53 weeks and fiscal years 2014 and 2013 included 52 weeks.
21510_15_ITEM1_P1_S0	We are one of the world's leading suppliers of photonics-based solutions in a broad range of commercial and scientific research applications.
21510_15_ITEM1_P1_S1	We design, manufacture, service and market lasers and related accessories for a diverse group of customers.
21510_15_ITEM1_P1_S2	Since inception in 1966, we have grown through internal expansion and through strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies, intellectual property, manufacturing processes and product offerings.
21510_15_ITEM1_P1_S3	We are organized into two operating segments: Specialty Lasers and Systems ("SLS") and Commercial Lasers and Components ("CLC").
21510_15_ITEM1_P1_S4	This segmentation reflects the go-to-market strategies for various products and markets.
21510_15_ITEM1_P1_S5	While both segments deliver cost-effective photonics solutions, SLS develops and manufactures configurable, advanced performance products largely serving the microelectronics, scientific research and government programs and original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") components and instrumentation markets.
21510_15_ITEM1_P1_S6	The size and complexity of many of the SLS products require service to be performed at the customer site by factory-trained field service engineers.
21510_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	CLC focuses on higher volume products that are offered in set configurations.
21510_15_ITEM1_P2_S1	The product architectures are designed for easy exchange at the point of use such that substantially all product service and repairs are based upon advanced replacement and depot (i.e., factory) repair.
21510_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	CLC's primary markets include materials processing, OEM components and instrumentation and microelectronics.
21510_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	Income from operations is the measure of profit and loss that our chief operating decision maker ("CODM") uses to assess performance and make decisions.
21510_15_ITEM1_P4_S1	Income from operations represents the sales less the cost of sales and direct operating expenses incurred within the operating segments as well as allocated expenses such as shared sales and manufacturing costs.
21510_15_ITEM1_P4_S2	We do not allocate to our operating segments certain operating expenses, which we manage separately at the corporate level.
21510_15_ITEM1_P4_S3	These unallocated costs include stock-based compensation and corporate functions (certain advanced research and development, management, finance, legal and human resources) and are included in Corporate and other.
21510_15_ITEM1_P4_S4	Management does not consider unallocated Corporate and other costs in its measurement of segment performance.
21510_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	We were originally incorporated in California on May 26, 1966 and reincorporated in Delaware on October 1, 1990.
21510_15_ITEM1_P5_S1	Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and we are a member of the Standard Poor's SmallCap 600 Index and the Russell 2000 Index.
21510_15_ITEM1_P5_S2	Additional information about Coherent, Inc. (referred to herein as the Company, we, our, or Coherent) is available on our web site at www.coherent.com.
21510_15_ITEM1_P5_S3	We make available, free of charge on our web site, access to our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as soon as reasonably practicable after we file or furnish them electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").

21510_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	Any product, product name, process, or technology described in these materials is the property of Coherent.
21510_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	A laser emits an intense coherent beam of light with some unique and highly useful properties.
21510_15_ITEM1_P7_S1	Most importantly, a laser is orders of magnitude brighter than any lamp.
21510_15_ITEM1_P7_S2	As a result of its coherence, the beam can be focused to a very small and intense spot, useful for applications requiring very high power densities including cutting and other materials processing procedures.
21510_15_ITEM1_P7_S3	The laser's high spatial resolution is also useful for microscopic imaging and inspection applications.
21510_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	Laser light can be monochromatic all the beam energy is confined to a narrow wavelength band.
21510_15_ITEM1_P8_S1	Some lasers can be used to create ultrafast output a series of pulses with pulse durations as short as attoseconds (i.e., 10 -18 seconds).
21510_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	There are many types of lasers and one way of classifying them is by the material or medium used to create the lasing action.
21510_15_ITEM1_P9_S1	This can be in the form of a gas, liquid, semiconductor, solid state crystal or fiber.
21510_15_ITEM1_P9_S2	Lasers can also be classified by their output wavelength: ultraviolet, visible, infrared or wavelength tunable.
21510_15_ITEM1_P9_S3	We manufacture all of these laser types.
21510_15_ITEM1_P9_S4	There are also many options in terms of pulsed output versus continuous wave, pulse duration, output power, beam dimensions, etc.
21510_15_ITEM1_P9_S5	In fact, each application has its specific requirements in terms of laser performance.
21510_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	to offer a diverse set of product lines characterized by lasers targeted at growth opportunities and key applications.
21510_15_ITEM1_P10_S1	In all cases, we aim to be the supplier of choice by offering a high-value combination of superior technical performance and high reliability.
21510_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	Photonics has taken its place alongside electronics as a critical enabling technology for the twenty-first century.
21510_15_ITEM1_P11_S1	Photonics based solutions are entrenched in a broad array of industries that include industrial automation, textile processing, microelectronics, flat panel displays and medical diagnostics, with adoption continuing in ever more diverse applications.
21510_15_ITEM1_P11_S2	Growth in these applications stems from two sources.
21510_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	First, there are many applications where the laser is displacing conventional technology because it can do the job faster, better or more economically.
21510_15_ITEM1_P12_S1	Second, there are new applications where the laser is the enabling tool that makes the work possible (e.g., the production of sub 50 micron microvias); these lasers are used in the manufacturing of high density printed circuit boards ("PCBs") found in the latest smart phones and tablet computers.
21510_15_ITEM1_P12_S2	Key laser applications include: semiconductor inspection; manufacturing of advanced PCBs; flat panel display manufacturing; solar cell production; medical and bio-instrumentation; materials processing; metals cutting and welding; industrial process and quality control; marking; imaging and printing; graphic arts and display; and, research and development.
21510_15_ITEM1_P12_S3	For example, ultraviolet ( UV ) lasers are enabling the move towards miniaturization, which drives innovation and growth in many markets.
21510_15_ITEM1_P12_S4	In addition, the advent of industrial grade ultrafast lasers continues to open up new applications for laser processing.
21510_15_ITEM1_P12_S5	We strive to develop innovative and proprietary products and solutions that meet the needs of our customers and that are based on our core expertise in lasers and optical technologies.

21510_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	Streamline our manufacturing structure and improve our cost structure We will focus on optimizing the mix of products that we manufacture internally and externally.
21510_15_ITEM1_P17_S1	We will utilize vertical integration where our internal manufacturing process is considered proprietary and seek to leverage external sources when the capabilities and cost structure are well developed and on a path towards commoditization.
21510_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	Focus on long-term improvement of adjusted EBITDA, in dollars and as a percentage of net sales We define adjusted EBITDA as operating income adjusted for depreciation, amortization, stock compensation expenses, major restructuring costs and certain other non-operating income and expense items.
21510_15_ITEM1_P18_S1	Key initiatives to reach our goals for EBITDA improvements include utilization of our Asian manufacturing locations, rationalizing our supply chain and continued leveraging of our infrastructure.
21510_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	APPLICATIONS Our products address a broad range of applications that we group into the following markets: Microelectronics, Materials Processing, OEM Components and Instrumentation and Scientific Research and Government Programs.
21510_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	Microelectronics Nowhere is the trend towards miniaturization more prevalent than in the Microelectronics market where smart phones, tablets, personal computers ("PC's"), televisions ("TV's") and now "wearables" are driving advances in displays, integrated circuits and PCBs.
21510_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	In response to market demands and expectations, semiconductor and device manufacturers are continually seeking to improve their process and design technologies in order to manufacture smaller, more powerful and more reliable devices at lower cost.
21510_15_ITEM1_P21_S1	New laser applications and new laser technologies are a key element in delivering higher resolution and higher precision at lower manufacturing cost.
21510_15_ITEM1_P21_S2	We support three major markets in the microelectronics industry: (1) flat panel display ("FPDs") manufacturing, (2) advanced packaging and interconnects and (3) semiconductor front-end.
21510_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	Microelectronics flat panel display manufacturing The high-volume consumer market is driving the production of FPDs in applications such as mobile phones, tablets, laptop computers, TVs and wearables.
21510_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	There are several types of established and emerging displays based on quite different technologies, including liquid crystal ("LCD") and organic light emitting diodes ("OLED").
21510_15_ITEM1_P23_S1	Each of these technologies utilize laser applications due to the fact that lasers enable higher process speed, better yield, improved battery life, lower cost and/or superior display brightness and resolution.
21510_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	Several display types require a high-density pattern of silicon thin film transistors ("TFTs").
21510_15_ITEM1_P24_S1	If this silicon is polycrystalline, the display performance is greatly enhanced.
21510_15_ITEM1_P24_S2	In the past, these polysilicon layers could only be produced on expensive special glass at high temperatures.
21510_15_ITEM1_P24_S3	However, excimer-based processes, such as excimer laser annealing ("ELA") have allowed high-volume production of low-temperature polysilicon ("LTPS") on conventional glass substrates.
21510_15_ITEM1_P24_S4	Our excimer lasers provide a unique solution for LTPS because they are the only industrial-grade excimer lasers with the high pulse energy optimized for this application.
21510_15_ITEM1_P24_S5	The current state-of-the-art product for this application is our excimer VYPER laser, which delivers over 1000W of power, enabling customers to scale to current Generation 5.5 6 substrates all the way up to Generation 8 sizes.
21510_15_ITEM1_P24_S6	These systems are integral to the manufacturing process on all leading LTPS-based smart phone displays, with the highest commercially available pixel densities of greater than 300 pixels per inch (ppi), with the current trends going to even higher ppi for high end smart phones, and hold the potential for deployment in tablet display and OLED TV manufacturing.
21510_15_ITEM1_P24_S7	Our AVIA, Rapid, Talisker and DIAMOND lasers are also used in other production processes for FPDs.
21510_15_ITEM1_P24_S8	These processes include drilling, cutting, patterning, marking and yield improvement.
21510_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	During fiscal 2015 we introduced a range of new industry leading products and product platforms, including ultrafast lasers with pulse durations below 1 pico second (ps), or femto second (fs) lasers.
21510_15_ITEM1_P25_S1	Ps and fs lasers are commonly referred to collectively as ultrafast lasers.
21510_15_ITEM1_P25_S2	Our new fs lasers, Monaco and Rapid FX, offer performances ideal for industrial applications in microelectronics, materials processing and medical applications coupled with superior reliability and cost of ownership.
21510_15_ITEM1_P25_S3	We also introduced a new laser based on our DIAMOND J-series using carbon-monoxide ("CO") as the lasing medium.
21510_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	CO lasers produce laser radiation in a wavelength region where there are few commercially available laser sources and none at powers suitable for materials processing.
21510_15_ITEM1_P26_S1	The unique wavelength range of this laser opens up laser processing to additional materials and can improve the precision and throughput with which we process some traditional carbon dioxide ("CO 2 ") laser applications, including in the areas of materials processing, medical therapy and microelectronics.
21510_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	We are the only supplier of commercial, high power CO lasers.
21510_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	Microelectronics advanced packaging and interconnects After a wafer is patterned, there are then a host of other processes, referred to as back-end processing, which finally result in a packaged encapsulated silicon chip.
21510_15_ITEM1_P28_S1	Ultimately, these chips are then assembled into finished products.
21510_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	The advent of high-speed logic and high-memory content devices has caused chip manufacturers to look for alternative technologies to improve performance and lower process costs.
21510_15_ITEM1_P29_S1	In terms of materials, this search includes new types of materials, such as low-k and thinner silicon.
21510_15_ITEM1_P29_S2	Our AVIA, Rapid, Talisker and Matrix lasers provide economical methods of cutting and scribing these wafers while delivering higher yields than traditional mechanical methods.
21510_15_ITEM1_P29_S3	There are similar trends in chip packaging and PCB manufacturing requiring more compact packaging and denser interconnects.
21510_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	In many cases, lasers present enabling technologies.
21510_15_ITEM1_P30_S1	For instance, lasers are now the only economically practical method for drilling microvias in chip substrates and in both rigid and flexible PCBs.
21510_15_ITEM1_P30_S2	These microvias are tiny interconnects that are essential for enabling high-density circuitry commonly used in smart phones, tablets and advanced computing systems.
21510_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	Our DIAMOND CO 2 and AVIA diode pumped solid state ("DPSS") lasers are the lasers of choice in this application.
21510_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	In addition, multi-layer circuit boards require more flexible production methods than conventional printing technologies can offer, which has led to widespread adoption of laser direct imaging ("LDI").
21510_15_ITEM1_P32_S1	Our Paladin laser is used for this application.
21510_15_ITEM1_P32_S2	Lasers have also become a valuable tool in high-brightness ("HB") light-emitting diode ("LED") manufacturing, improving LED performance and yield.
21510_15_ITEM1_P32_S3	LEDs have widespread adoption as the light source in all categories of LCD displays, from phones all the way to full size TVs and moving into general lighting.
21510_15_ITEM1_P32_S4	Our lasers are used in back-end processing of HB-LEDs.
21510_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	Microelectronics semiconductor front-end The term "front-end" refers to the production of semiconductor devices which occurs prior to packaging.
21510_15_ITEM1_P33_S1	As semiconductor device geometries decrease in size, devices become increasingly susceptible to smaller defects during each phase of the manufacturing process and these defects can negatively impact yield.
21510_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	One of the semiconductor industry's responses to the increasing vulnerability of semiconductor devices to smaller defects has been to use defect detection and inspection techniques that are closely linked to the manufacturing process.
21510_15_ITEM1_P34_S1	For example, automated laser-based inspection systems are now used to detect and locate defects as small as 0.01 micron, which may not be observable by conventional optical microscopes.
21510_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	Detecting the presence of defects is only the first step in preventing their recurrence.
21510_15_ITEM1_P35_S1	After detection, defects must be examined in order to identify their size, shape and the process step in which the defect occurred.
21510_15_ITEM1_P35_S2	This examination is called defect classification.
21510_15_ITEM1_P35_S3	Identification of the sources of defects in the lengthy and complex semiconductor manufacturing process has become essential for maintaining high yield production.
21510_15_ITEM1_P35_S4	Semiconductor manufacturing has become an around-the-clock operation and it is important for products used for inspection, measurement and testing to be reliable and to have long lifetimes.
21510_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	Our Azure, Paladin and Excimer lasers are used to detect and characterize defects in semiconductor chips.
21510_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	Materials processing Lasers are widely accepted today in many important industrial manufacturing applications including cutting, welding, joining, drilling, perforating, and marking of metals and nonmetals.

21510_15_ITEM1_P37_S13	In the specific area of textiles and clothing, our DIAMOND lasers service older applications, such as cutting complex shapes in leather for footwear, as well as newer applications such as creating detailed fade patterns on designer denims.
21510_15_ITEM1_P37_S14	Laser marking and coding are generally considered part of the precision materials processing applications market for which we remain a leading supplier.
21510_15_ITEM1_P37_S15	The optimum choice of laser depends on the material being marked, whether it is a surface mark (engraved) or a sub-surface mark, and the specific economics of the application.
21510_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	Our DIAMOND J, C and GEM Series of CO 2 lasers provide many systems manufacturers with a reliable cost effective source for marking and engraving on non-metals.
21510_15_ITEM1_P39_S0	In addition, our Matrix and Helios product lines of reliable, compact and low-cost DPSS lasers provide an ideal solution for marking of other materials in high volume manufacturing.

21510_15_ITEM1_P39_S4	We also support the laser-based instrumentation market with a range of laser-related components, including diode lasers for optical pumping.
21510_15_ITEM1_P39_S5	Our OEM component business includes sales to other, less integrated laser manufacturers participating in OEM markets such as materials processing, scientific, and medical.
21510_15_ITEM1_P40_S0	Bio-instrumentation Bio-instrumentation applications for lasers include bio-agent detection for point source and standoff detection of pathogens or other bio-toxins; confocal microscopy for biological imaging that allows researchers and clinicians to visualize cellular and subcellular structures and processes with an incredible amount of detail; DNA sequencing that provides automation and data acquisition rates that would be impossible by any other method; drug discovery genomic and proteomic analyses that enable drug discovery to proceed at very high throughput rates; and flow cytometry for analyzing single cells or populations of cells in a heterogeneous mixture, including blood samples.
21510_15_ITEM1_P40_S1	Our OBIS, Flare, Galaxy, Sapphire, BioRay and Genesis lasers are used in several bio-instrumentation applications.
21510_15_ITEM1_P40_S2	Medical Therapy We sell a variety of components and lasers to medical laser companies in end-user applications such as ophthalmology, aesthetic, surgical, therapeutic and dentistry.

21510_15_ITEM1_P40_S4	We have a leading position in Lasik and photorefractive keratectomy surgery methods with our ExciStar XS excimer laser platform.
21510_15_ITEM1_P40_S5	We also provide ultrafast lasers for use in cataract surgery, a growing applications space.
21510_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	The unique ability of our optically pumped semiconductor lasers ("OPSL") technology to match a wavelength to an application has led to the development of a high-power yellow (577nm) laser for the treatment of eye related diseases, such as Age Related Macular Degeneration and retinal diseases associated with diabetes.
21510_15_ITEM1_P41_S1	The 577nm wavelength was designed to match the peak in absorption of oxygenated hemoglobin thereby allowing treatment to occur at a lower power level, and thus reducing stress and heat-load placed on the eye with traditional green-based (530nm) solid state lasers.
21510_15_ITEM1_P41_S2	Other applications where our OBIS, Genesis and Sapphire series of lasers are used include the retinal scanning market in diagnostic imaging systems as well as new ground breaking in-vivo imaging.
21510_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	Scientific research and government programs We are widely recognized as a technology innovator and the scientific market has historically provided an ideal "test market" for our leading-edge innovations.
21510_15_ITEM1_P42_S1	These have included ultrafast lasers, DPSS lasers, continuous-wave ("CW") systems, excimer gas lasers and water-cooled ion gas lasers.
21510_15_ITEM1_P42_S2	Our portfolio of lasers that address the scientific research market is broad and includes our Chameleon, COMPexPro, Evolution, Fidelity, Legend, Libra, MBD, MBR, Monaco, Vitara, Mephisto, Mira and Verdi lasers.
21510_15_ITEM1_P42_S3	Many of the innovations and products pioneered in the scientific marketplace have become commercial successes for both our OEM customers and us.
21510_15_ITEM1_P42_S4	We have a large installed base of scientific lasers which are used in a wide range of applications spanning virtually every branch of science and engineering.
21510_15_ITEM1_P42_S5	These applications include biology and life science, engineering, physical chemistry and physics.
21510_15_ITEM1_P42_S6	Most of these applications require the use of ultrafast lasers that enable the generation of pulses short enough to be measured in femto- or attoseconds (10 -15 to 10 -18 seconds).
21510_15_ITEM1_P42_S7	Because of these very short pulse durations, ultrafast lasers enable the study of fundamental physical and chemical processes with temporal resolution unachievable with any other tool.
21510_15_ITEM1_P42_S8	These lasers also deliver very high peak power and large bandwidths, which can be used to generate many exotic effects.
21510_15_ITEM1_P42_S9	Some of these are now finding their way into mainstream applications, such as microscopy or materials processing.
21510_15_ITEM1_P42_S10	The use of ultrafast lasers such as the Chameleon in microscopy is now a common occurrence in bio-imaging labs, and they have become a crucial tool in modern brain research.
21510_15_ITEM1_P42_S11	We recently released a new product called the Chameleon Discovery targeted to this market.
21510_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	Lasers are widely used in mass production microelectronics applications largely because they enable entirely new application capabilities that cannot be realized by any other known means.
21510_15_ITEM1_P43_S1	These laser-based fabrication and testing methods provide a level of precision, typically on a micrometer and nanometer level, that are unique, faster, are touch free, deliver superior end products, increase yields, and/or cut production costs.
21510_15_ITEM1_P43_S2	We anticipate this trend to continue, driven primarily by the increasing sophistication and miniaturization of consumer electronic goods and their convergence via the internet, resulting in increasing demand for better displays, more bandwidth and memory, and all packaged into devices which are lighter, thinner and consume less power.
21510_15_ITEM1_P43_S3	Although this market follows the macro-economic trends and carries inherent risks, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to capitalize on the current market trends and that we will see continued increased adoption of our solid-state, CO 2 , fiber, direct diode and excimer lasers, as all these lasers enable entirely new applications, performance improvements and reduced process costs.
21510_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	LTPS-based high resolution mobile displays (greater than 300ppi), and especially the emergence of OLED technology, is evolving as the prevalent FPD technology.
21510_15_ITEM1_P44_S1	We believe we are well positioned, especially with our Vyper Excimer lasers and LB optical systems, to take advantage of this trend, including flexible OLED displays.
21510_15_ITEM1_P44_S2	CO 2 , Avia, Matrix, Rapid, Talisker, Helios and direct diode lasers all seem aligned with the need for related FPD touch panel, film cutting, light guide technology, repair, frit welding, as well as sapphire and glass-cutting applications.
21510_15_ITEM1_P45_S0	The trend for thinner and lighter devices is impacting the glass substrates used in today s mobile devices requiring thinner glass with higher degrees of mechanical strength and scratch resistance.
21510_15_ITEM1_P45_S1	This trend also includes use of sapphire instead of glass.
21510_15_ITEM1_P45_S2	Mechanical means of cutting these glass and sapphire pieces are no longer adequate to meet future requirements and we expect lasers to play an increased role.
21510_15_ITEM1_P45_S3	Our CO, CO 2, Monaco and Rapid lasers are well positioned to take advantage of this trend.
21510_15_ITEM1_P45_S4	Semiconductor devices look set to continue Moore's Law, shrinking device geometries for at least another decade, as well as expanding vertically into new 3D structures.
21510_15_ITEM1_P45_S5	As a result we believe our many UV laser sources (such as Azure, Paladin, Avia, Rapid, ExiStar and Matrix) will continue to find increasing adoption, since their unique optical properties align well with the process demands of a nanometer scale world.
21510_15_ITEM1_P45_S6	The same lasers plus Monaco, Rapid FX, CO and CO 2 are also widely adopted for back end Advanced Packaging and Interconnect (API) applications.
21510_15_ITEM1_P45_S7	With dimension roadmaps showing a decade of dimension shrink on PCBs, interconnects, Silicon LED scribe widths and wafer thickness, we believe that our portfolio of lasers aligns well with these demands as well as new processes that seem likely to be enabled by our lasers, to meet the increasing demands and decreasing tolerances of these markets.
21510_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	Materials processing The market for low to medium power CO 2 , solid state and semiconductor lasers used in industrial materials processing is very diverse.
21510_15_ITEM1_P46_S1	New product introductions such as our Diamond J-series CO 2 and CO lasers continue to support our growth in this area.
21510_15_ITEM1_P46_S2	These lasers represent a cost-effective manufacturing solution for cutting, joining, marking and engraving of non-metal materials including marking/coding, flat bed cutting, engraving, as well as the production of capital equipment for apparel and leather goods manufacturing.
21510_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	The market for kW class fiber lasers has seen strong growth in recent years, replacing legacy multi-kW CO 2 lasers in metal cutting and other applications.
21510_15_ITEM1_P47_S1	This trend will likely continue into the future.
21510_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	The favorable cost of ownership of high power diode and fiber lasers has expanded their use in a number of metal processing applications in addition to cutting.
21510_15_ITEM1_P48_S1	They have seen adoption in welding and brazing applications as well as newer growth areas in additive manufacturing like cladding and 3D printing.
21510_15_ITEM1_P48_S2	We believe we are well positioned to benefit from these large and growing markets with our line of kW fiber and diode lasers.
21510_15_ITEM1_P48_S3	We have developed an expanded portfolio of lasers with a broad spectrum of wavelengths and power levels, enabling optimum solutions for virtually every metal and non-metal material type.
21510_15_ITEM1_P48_S4	At the same time, the higher reliability of these products has lowered the cost of ownership.
21510_15_ITEM1_P48_S5	The bio instrumentation market is on a steady path in the most important areas: microscopy, flow cytometry and DNA sequencing, which all are enjoying solid research funding on a worldwide basis with some local variations.
21510_15_ITEM1_P49_S0	In this field, our OPSL technology gives us differentiated products at a number of important wavelengths.
21510_15_ITEM1_P49_S1	This advantage coupled with strong focus on meeting our customers demands for more compact and cost effective sources has made us very successful and we expect that to continue.
21510_15_ITEM1_P49_S2	Our OPSL technology resulted in the first truly continuous wave solid-state UV laser which enables the use of UV in a clinical as well as a research environment.
21510_15_ITEM1_P50_S0	In the medical therapeutic area, we see solid business with several opportunities for growth.
21510_15_ITEM1_P50_S1	We supply excimer lasers used in refractive eye surgery and are actively involved in further developments in laser vision correction including the use of ultrafast lasers in applications such as laser cataract surgery where higher precision and use of advanced implants enable better and more reliable patient outcomes.
21510_15_ITEM1_P50_S2	Laser cataract surgery is a relatively new application which is expected to see strong growth over the next several years.
21510_15_ITEM1_P50_S3	We also have opportunities in dental procedures for both hard and soft tissue ablation, with greatly improved patient comfort and outcome.
21510_15_ITEM1_P51_S0	In the area of photocoagulation, our Genesis OPSL yellow lasers are being used as the wavelength is particularly suitable for the treatment of blood vessels.
21510_15_ITEM1_P51_S1	In aesthetic laser procedures, we are an OEM supplier of CO 2 and semiconductor lasers to the major manufacturers of equipment used in the latest procedures in dermatology and hair removal.
21510_15_ITEM1_P52_S0	Scientific research and government programs Worldwide scientific funding seems very stable overall, with some regions growing and others just holding their current level.
21510_15_ITEM1_P53_S0	Bright spots include the strong push in neuroscience to better understand how the brain works.
21510_15_ITEM1_P53_S1	Lasers play a very important role in imaging brain structure as well as tracking activity in animal brains using techniques such as optogenetics.
21510_15_ITEM1_P53_S2	We believe that our current and upcoming products are well positioned to take advantage of this exciting opportunity.
21510_15_ITEM1_P53_S3	In physics and chemistry applications, our recent product introductions of high performance and industrially hardened ultrafast products have been very well received.
21510_15_ITEM1_P53_S4	While this is a very competitive market, we expect that our new products will position us for growth.

21510_15_ITEM1_P56_S3	These investments, once integrated into our broader product portfolio, provide our customers with uniquely differentiated solutions and the opportunity to substantially enhance the performance, reliability and capability of the products we offer.
21510_15_ITEM1_P57_S0	TECHNOLOGIES Diode-pumped solid-state lasers DPSS lasers use semiconductor lasers to pump a crystal to produce a laser beam.
21510_15_ITEM1_P57_S1	By changing the energy, optical components and the types of crystals used in the laser, different wavelengths and types of laser light can be produced.
21510_15_ITEM1_P58_S0	The efficiency, reliability, longevity and relatively low cost of DPSS lasers make them ideally suited for a wide range of OEM and end-user applications, particularly those requiring 24-hour operations.
21510_15_ITEM1_P59_S0	Our DPSS systems are compact and self-contained sealed units.
21510_15_ITEM1_P59_S1	Unlike conventional tools and other lasers, our DPSS lasers require minimal maintenance since they do not have internal controls or components that require adjusting and cleaning to maintain consistency.
21510_15_ITEM1_P59_S2	They are also less affected by environmental changes in temperature and humidity, which can alter alignment and inhibit performance in many systems.
21510_15_ITEM1_P60_S0	We manufacture a variety of types of DPSS lasers for different applications including semiconductor inspection; advanced packaging and interconnects; laser pumping; spectroscopy; bio-agent detection; DNA sequencing; drug discovery; flow cytometry; forensics; computer-to-plate printing; entertainment lighting (display); medical; rapid prototyping and marking, welding, engraving, cutting and drilling.
21510_15_ITEM1_P61_S0	Fiber lasers Fiber lasers use semiconductor lasers to pump a doped optical fiber to produce a laser beam.
21510_15_ITEM1_P61_S1	The unique features of a fiber laser make them suitable for producing high power, continuous wave laser beams.
21510_15_ITEM1_P61_S2	We introduced a multi kilowatt fiber laser platform in fiscal 2015.
21510_15_ITEM1_P61_S3	Our fiber laser design has several unique features including a modular design for improved serviceability and diode bar based pumping.
21510_15_ITEM1_P61_S4	Due to packaging efficiency, diode bars reduce the overall cost of a fiber laser.
21510_15_ITEM1_P62_S0	Some of the most critical components inside a fiber laser include the gain fiber itself and the diodes providing the pump power.
21510_15_ITEM1_P62_S1	We are well positioned as a fiber laser supplier since we are vertically integrated with respect to these key technologies; we use diode bars and fiber manufactured in-house.
21510_15_ITEM1_P62_S2	We plan to continue to drive cost reduction in our diode laser pumps and demonstrate the scalability of the platform by moving up the power scale into the multi kilowatt regime.
21510_15_ITEM1_P62_S3	This platform will address the large growing high power metal cutting and joining market.
21510_15_ITEM1_P63_S0	Gas lasers (CO, CO 2 , Excimer, Ion) The breadth of our gas laser portfolio is industry leading, encompassing CO, CO 2 , excimer and ion laser technologies.
21510_15_ITEM1_P64_S0	Gas lasers derive their name from the use of one or more gases as a lasing medium.
21510_15_ITEM1_P64_S1	They collectively span an extremely diverse and useful emission range, from the very deep ultraviolet to the far infrared.
21510_15_ITEM1_P64_S2	This diverse range of available wavelengths, coupled with high optical output power, and an abundance of other attractive characteristics, makes gas lasers extremely useful and popular for a variety of microelectronics, scientific, medical therapeutic and materials processing applications.
21510_15_ITEM1_P65_S0	Our OPSL platform is a surface emitting semiconductor laser that is energized or pumped by a semiconductor laser.
21510_15_ITEM1_P65_S1	The use of optical pumping circumvents inherent power scaling limitations of electrically pumped lasers, enabling very high powered devices.
21510_15_ITEM1_P65_S2	A wide range of wavelengths can be achieved by varying the semiconductor materials used in the device and changing the frequency of the laser beam using techniques common in solid state lasers.
21510_15_ITEM1_P65_S3	The platform leverages high reliability technologies developed for telecommunications and produces a compact, rugged, high power, single-mode laser.
21510_15_ITEM1_P65_S4	Our OPSL products are well suited to a wide range of applications, including the bio-instrumentation, medical therapeutics and graphic arts and display markets.
21510_15_ITEM1_P65_S5	We continue to expand our ultraviolet version of the OPSL platform called the Genesis, which was developed for the bio-instrumentation market.
21510_15_ITEM1_P66_S0	Semiconductor lasers High power edge emitting semiconductor diode lasers use the same principles as widely-used CD and DVD lasers, but produce significantly higher power levels.
21510_15_ITEM1_P66_S1	The advantages of this type of laser include smaller size, longer life, enhanced reliability and greater efficiency.
21510_15_ITEM1_P67_S0	We manufacture a wide range of discrete semiconductor laser products with wavelengths ranging from 650nm to over 1000nm and output powers ranging from 1W to over 100W, with highly integrated products in the kW range.
21510_15_ITEM1_P67_S1	These products are available in a variety of industry standard form factors including the following: bare die, packaged and fiber coupled single emitters and bars, monolithic stacks and fully integrated modules with microprocessor controlled units that contain power supplies and active coolers.
21510_15_ITEM1_P68_S0	removal, cosmetic dentistry), graphic arts, counter measures, rangefinders, target designators, cladding, hardening and plastic welding.
21510_15_ITEM1_P69_S0	Lasers Ultrafast lasers are lasers generating light pulses with durations of a few femtoseconds (10 -15 seconds) to a few tens of picoseconds (10 -11 seconds).
21510_15_ITEM1_P69_S1	These types of lasers are used for medical, advanced microelectronics and materials processing applications as well as scientific research.
21510_15_ITEM1_P69_S2	UF laser oscillators generate a train of pulses at 50-100 MHz, with peak powers of tens of kilowatts, and UF laser amplifiers generate pulses at 1-2000 kHz, with peak powers up to several Terawatts.
21510_15_ITEM1_P69_S3	The extremely short duration of UF laser pulses enables temporally resolving fast events like the dynamics of atoms or electrons.
21510_15_ITEM1_P69_S4	In addition, the high peak power enables so-called non-linear effects where several photons can be absorbed by a molecule at the same time.
21510_15_ITEM1_P69_S5	This type of process enables applications like multi-photon excitation microscopy or UF ablation of materials with high precision and minimal thermal damage.
21510_15_ITEM1_P70_S0	The use of our ultrafast lasers in applications outside science has been growing rapidly over the last several years, particularly in microelectronics and materials processing applications.

21510_15_ITEM1_P76_S0	MANUFACTURING Strategies One of our core manufacturing strategies is to tightly control our supply of key parts, components, sub-assemblies and outsourcing partners.
21510_15_ITEM1_P76_S1	We primarily utilize vertical integration when we have proprietary internal capabilities that are not cost-effectively available from external sources.
21510_15_ITEM1_P76_S2	We believe this is essential to maintain high quality products and enable rapid development and deployment of new products and technologies.
21510_15_ITEM1_P76_S3	We provide customers with 24-hour technical expertise and quality that is International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") certified at our principal manufacturing sites.
21510_15_ITEM1_P76_S4	Committed to quality and customer satisfaction, we design and produce many of our own components and sub-assemblies in order to retain quality and performance control.
21510_15_ITEM1_P76_S5	We have also outsourced certain components, sub-assemblies and finished goods where we can maintain our high quality standards while improving our cost structure.
21510_15_ITEM1_P76_S6	As part of our strategy to increase our market share and customer support in Asia as well as our continuing efforts to manage costs, we have transferred the production of additional products into both of our Singapore and Malaysia factories.
21510_15_ITEM1_P76_S7	In addition, we expanded our repair activities in our China operation.
21510_15_ITEM1_P76_S8	This has allowed us to reduce service response time and inventories, providing benefits to us and to our customers.
21510_15_ITEM1_P76_S9	We have also established an International Procurement Office in Singapore and have been increasing our sourcing of materials from Asia to reduce material costs on a global basis.
21510_15_ITEM1_P76_S10	In fiscal 2012, we opened a tube refurbishment manufacturing site in South Korea to better service our customers in that region.
21510_15_ITEM1_P76_S11	In fiscal 2013, we expanded our manufacturing presence in Germany through the acquisition of Lumera.
21510_15_ITEM1_P76_S12	In fiscal 2015, we increased our vertical integration capabilities with the asset acquisition of the Tinsley Optics business from L-3 Communications Corporation.
21510_15_ITEM1_P77_S0	We have designed and implemented proprietary manufacturing tools, equipment and techniques in an effort to provide products that differentiate us from our competitors.
21510_15_ITEM1_P77_S1	These proprietary manufacturing techniques are utilized in a number of our product lines including our gas laser production, crystal growth, beam alignment as well as the wafer growth for our semiconductor and optically pumped semiconductor laser product family.
21510_15_ITEM1_P78_S0	Raw materials or sub-components required in the manufacturing process are generally available from several sources.
21510_15_ITEM1_P78_S1	However, we currently purchase several key components and materials, including exotic materials, crystals and optics, used in the manufacture of our products from sole source or limited source suppliers.

21510_15_ITEM1_P79_S0	INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights.
21510_15_ITEM1_P79_S1	As of October 3, 2015 , we held approximately 484 U.S. and foreign patents, which expire from 2015 through 2032 (depending on the payment of maintenance fees) and we have approximately 139 additional pending patent applications that have been filed.
21510_15_ITEM1_P79_S2	The issued patents cover various products in all of the major markets that we serve.
21510_15_ITEM1_P80_S0	For a discussion of the importance to our business of, and the risks attendant to intellectual property rights, see "Risk Factors" in Item 1A "We may not be able to protect our proprietary technology which could adversely affect our competitive advantage" and "We may, in the future, be subject to claims or litigation from third parties, for claims of infringement of their proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of competitors or other rights holders.
21510_15_ITEM1_P80_S1	These claims could result in costly litigation and the diversion of our technical and management personnel.
21510_15_ITEM1_P81_S0	COMPETITION Competition in the various photonics markets in which we provide products is very intense.
21510_15_ITEM1_P81_S1	We compete against a number of companies including CVI Melles Griot, GSI Group, Inc., IPG Photonics Corporation, Lumentum Holdings Inc., Newport Corporation, Rofin-Sinar Technologies, Inc., Trumpf GmbH, as well as other smaller companies.
21510_15_ITEM1_P81_S2	We compete globally based on our broad product offering, reliability, cost, and performance advantages for the widest range of commercial and scientific research applications.
21510_15_ITEM1_P81_S3	Other considerations by our customers include warranty, global service and support and distribution.
21510_15_ITEM1_P81_S4	At fiscal 2015 year-end, our backlog of orders scheduled for shipment (within one year) was $309.5 million compared to $328.3 million at fiscal 2014 year-end.
21510_15_ITEM1_P81_S5	By segment, backlog for SLS was $219.3 million and $253.0 million , respectively, at fiscal 2015 and 2014 year-ends.
21510_15_ITEM1_P81_S6	Backlog for CLC was $90.2 million and $75.3 million , respectively, at fiscal 2015 and 2014 year-ends.
21510_15_ITEM1_P81_S7	The decrease in SLS backlog from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 year-end is primarily due to timing of large excimer laser annealing system shipments net of new orders for the flat panel display market, which explains the decrease in overall company backlog as well.
21510_15_ITEM1_P82_S0	Orders used to compute backlog are generally cancelable without substantial penalties.
21510_15_ITEM1_P83_S0	Historically, the rate of cancellation experienced by us has not been significant though we cannot guarantee that cancellations will not increase in the future.
21510_15_ITEM1_P83_S1	We have historically experienced decreased bookings and revenue in the first fiscal quarter compared to other quarters in our fiscal year due to the impact of time off and business closures at our facilities and those of many of our customers due to year-end holidays.
21510_15_ITEM1_P83_S2	For example over the past 10 years we have noted, excluding certain recovery years, our first fiscal quarter revenues have ranged 2%-12% below the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal years.
21510_15_ITEM1_P83_S3	This historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's future net sales or financial performance.
21510_15_ITEM1_P84_S0	As of fiscal 2015 year-end, we had 2,586 employees.
21510_15_ITEM1_P84_S1	Approximately 407 of our employees are involved in research and development; 1,572 of our employees are involved in operations, manufacturing, service and quality assurance; and 607 of our employees are involved in sales, order administration, marketing, finance, information technology, general management and other administrative functions.
21510_15_ITEM1_P84_S2	Our success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain employees.
21510_15_ITEM1_P84_S3	We face competition in this regard from other companies, research and academic institutions, government entities and other organizations.
21510_15_ITEM1_P84_S4	We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
21510_15_ITEM1_P85_S0	In July 2015, we acquired certain assets of Raydiance, Inc. ("Raydiance") for approximately $5.0 million, excluding transaction costs.

21510_15_ITEM1_P89_S6	Business Combinations" of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of this annual report for further discussion of recent acquisitions completed.
21510_15_ITEM1_P90_S0	Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, handling and disposal of regulated materials, chemicals, various radioactive materials and certain waste products.
21510_15_ITEM1_P90_S1	In the United States, we are subject to the federal regulation and control of the Environmental Protection Agency.
21510_15_ITEM1_P90_S2	Comparable authorities are involved in other countries.
21510_15_ITEM1_P90_S3	Such rules are subject to change by the governing agency and we monitor those changes closely.
21510_15_ITEM1_P90_S4	We expect all operations to meet the legal and regulatory environmental requirements and believe that compliance with those regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive and financial position.
21510_15_ITEM1_P90_S5	Although we believe that our safety procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of such materials comply with the standards required by federal and state laws and regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials.
21510_15_ITEM1_P90_S6	In the event of such an accident involving such materials, we could be liable for damages and such liability could exceed the amount of our liability insurance coverage and the resources of our business.
21510_15_ITEM1_P91_S0	We may face the potential of increasing complexity in our product designs and procurement operations due to the evolving nature of product compliance standards.
21510_15_ITEM1_P91_S1	Those standards may impact the material composition of our products entering specific markets.
21510_15_ITEM1_P91_S2	Such regulations went into effect in the European Union ("EU") in 2006, (The Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS)) and 2007 (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH)), and China in 2007 (Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products Regulation (China-RoHS)), and the US Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.
21510_15_ITEM1_P91_S3	Furthermore, we could face costs and liabilities in connection with product take-back legislation.
21510_15_ITEM1_P92_S0	Beginning in 2006, the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive made producers of electrical goods financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products.
21510_15_ITEM1_P92_S1	Similar laws are now pending in various jurisdictions around the world, including the United States.
21510_15_ITEM1_P93_S0	Environmental liabilities Our operations are subject to various laws and regulations governing the environment, including the discharge of pollutants and the management and disposal of hazardous substances.
21510_15_ITEM1_P93_S1	As a result of our historic as well as on-going operations, we could incur substantial costs, including remediation costs.
21510_15_ITEM1_P93_S2	The costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to predict.
21510_15_ITEM1_P93_S3	Our accruals for such costs and liabilities may not be adequate because the estimates on which the accruals are based depend on a number of factors including the nature of the matter, the complexity of the site, site geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) at multi-party sites and the number and financial viability of other PRPs.
21510_15_ITEM1_P94_S0	We are organized into two operating segments: Specialty Lasers and Systems ("SLS") and Commercial Lasers and Components ("CLC").
21510_15_ITEM1_P94_S1	This segmentation reflects the go-to-market strategies for various products and markets.
21510_15_ITEM1_P95_S0	SLS develops and manufactures configurable, advanced-performance products largely serving the microelectronics, scientific research and government programs and OEM components and instrumentation markets.
21510_15_ITEM1_P95_S1	The size and complexity of many of the SLS products require service to be performed at the customer site by factory-trained field service engineers.
21510_15_ITEM1_P96_S0	The product architectures are designed for easy exchange at the point of use such that product service and repairs are based upon advanced replacement and depot (i.e., factory) repair.
21510_15_ITEM1_P97_S0	CLC's primary markets include materials processing, OEM components and instrumentation and microelectronics.
21510_15_ITEM1_P98_S0	We have identified SLS and CLC as operating segments for which discrete financial information was available.
21510_15_ITEM1_P98_S1	Both units have dedicated engineering, manufacturing, product business management and product line management functions.
21510_15_ITEM1_P99_S0	A small portion of our outside revenue is attributable to projects and recently developed products for which a segment has not yet been determined.
21510_15_ITEM1_P100_S0	The associated direct and indirect costs are presented in the category of Corporate and other, along with other corporate costs.
21510_15_ITEM1_P101_S0	FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND EXPORT SALES Financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations for fiscal years 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , is set forth in Note 15, "Segment and Geographic Information" of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of this annual report.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND INDUSTRY TRENDS Our operating results, including net sales, net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA in dollars and as a percentage of net sales, as well as our stock price have varied in the past, and our future operating results will continue to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations based upon numerous factors, including those discussed in this Item 1A and throughout this report.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Our stock price will continue to be subject to daily variations as well.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Our future operating results and stock price may not follow any past trends or meet our guidance and expectations.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Our net sales and operating results, such as adjusted EBITDA percentage, net income (loss) and operating expenses, and our stock price have varied in the past and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year in the future.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P0_S4	We believe a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, could cause these variations and make them difficult to predict, including:
21510_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	distraction of management related to acquisition or divestment activities.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	In addition, we often recognize a substantial portion of our sales in the last month of our fiscal quarters.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Our expenses for any given quarter are typically based on expected sales and if sales are below expectations in any given quarter, the adverse impact of the shortfall on our operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P1_S3	We also base our manufacturing on our forecasted product mix for the quarter.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P1_S4	If the actual product mix varies significantly from our forecast, we may not be able to fill some orders during that quarter, which would result in delays in the shipment of our products.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Accordingly, variations in timing of sales, particularly for our higher priced, higher margin products, can cause significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Due to these and other factors, such as varying product mix, we believe that quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year comparisons of our historical operating results may not be meaningful.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P1_S7	You should not rely on our results for any quarter or year as an indication of our future performance.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P1_S8	Our operating results in future quarters and years may be below public market analysts' or investors' expectations, which would likely cause the price of our stock to fall.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P1_S9	In addition, over the past several years, U.S. and global equity markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the stock prices of many technology companies both in and outside our industry.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P1_S10	There has not always been a direct correlation between this volatility and the performance of particular companies subject to these stock price fluctuations.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P1_S11	These factors, as well as general economic and political conditions or investors' concerns regarding the credibility of corporate financial statements, may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our stock in the future.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We depend on sole source or limited source suppliers, both internal and external, for some of our key components and materials, including exotic materials, certain cutting-edge optics and crystals, in our products, which make us susceptible to supply shortages or price fluctuations that could adversely affect our business.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We currently purchase several key components and materials used in the manufacture of our products from sole source or limited source suppliers, both internal and external.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our failure to timely receive these key components and materials could cause delays in the shipment of our products.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Some of these suppliers are relatively small private companies that may discontinue their operations at any time and which may be particularly susceptible to prevailing economic conditions.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Some of our suppliers are located in regions which may be susceptible to natural disasters, such as the flooding in Thailand and the earthquake, tsunami and resulting nuclear disaster in Japan and severe flooding and power loss in the Eastern part of the United States in recent years.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Some may be vulnerable to man-made disasters, such as the recent worldwide shortage of neon gas as a result of the conflict in Ukraine.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We typically purchase our components and materials through purchase orders or agreed upon terms and conditions and we do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with many of these suppliers.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Some of our products, particularly in the flat panel display industry, require designs and specifications which are at the cutting-edge of available technologies.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Our and our customers' designs and specifications frequently change to meet rapidly evolving market demands.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Accordingly certain of our products require components and supplies which may be technologically difficult and unpredictable to manufacture.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P4_S4	By their very nature, these types of components may only be available by a single supplier.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P4_S5	These characteristics further pressure the timely delivery of such components.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P4_S6	We may fail to obtain these supplies in a timely manner in the future.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P4_S7	We may experience difficulty identifying alternative sources of supply for certain components used in our products and may have to incur expenses and management distraction in assisting our current and future suppliers to meet our and our customers' technical requirements.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P4_S8	We would experience further delays while identifying, evaluating and testing the products of these potential alternative suppliers.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P4_S9	Furthermore, financial or other difficulties faced by these suppliers or significant changes in demand for these components or materials could limit their availability.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P4_S10	We continue to consolidate our supply base and move supplier locations.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P4_S11	When we transition locations we may increase our inventory of such products as a safety stock during the transition, which may cause the amount of inventory reflected on our balance sheet to increase.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P4_S12	Additionally, many of our customers rely on sole source suppliers.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P4_S13	In the event of a disruption of our customers' supply chain, orders from our customers could decrease or be delayed.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P4_S14	Any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these components or materials, or the inability to obtain these components and materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time, or our failure to properly manage these moves, would impair our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and could cause customers to cancel orders.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We have historically relied exclusively on our own production capability to manufacture certain strategic components, crystals, semiconductor lasers, lasers and laser-based systems.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Because we manufacture, package and test these components, products and systems at our own facilities, and such components, products and systems are not readily available from other sources, any interruption in manufacturing would adversely affect our business.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Since many of our products have lengthy qualification periods, our ability to introduce multiple suppliers for parts may be limited.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P5_S3	In addition, our failure to achieve adequate manufacturing yields of these items at our manufacturing facilities may materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P5_S4	We participate in the microelectronics market, which requires significant research and development expenses to develop and maintain products and a failure to achieve market acceptance for our products could have a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P5_S5	The microelectronics market is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product introductions, the volatility of product supply and demand, changing customer requirements and evolving industry standards.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P5_S6	The nature of this market requires significant research and development expenses to participate, with substantial resources invested in advance of material sales of our products to our customers in this market.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P5_S7	Additionally, our product offerings may become obsolete given the frequent introduction of alternative technologies.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P5_S8	In the event either our customers' or our products fail to gain market acceptance, or the microelectronics market fails to grow, it would likely have a significant negative effect on our business and results of operations.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We participate in the flat panel display market, which has a relatively limited number of end customer manufacturers.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our backlog, timing of net sales and results of operations could be negatively impacted in the event our customers reschedule orders.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	In the flat panel display market, there are a relatively limited number of manufacturers who are the end customers for our annealing products.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	In each of our last three fiscal years, Advanced Process Systems Corporation, an integrator in the flat panel display market based in South Korea, has contributed more than 10% of our revenue.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Given macroeconomic conditions, varying consumer demand and technical process limitations at manufacturers, our customers may seek to reschedule or cancel orders.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Since these larger flat panel-related systems represent a large average selling price, rescheduling or canceling an order will likely have a significant impact on either our quarterly or annual net sales and results of operations.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Additionally, challenges in meeting evolving technological requirements for these complex products by us and our suppliers could also result in delays in shipments, rescheduled or canceled orders by our customers.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P9_S2	This could negatively impact our backlog, timing of net sales and results of operations.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P9_S3	As of October 3, 2015 , flat panel display systems represented 32% of our backlog.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Since our backlog includes higher average selling price flat panel display systems, any delays or cancellation of shipments could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P9_S5	Some of our laser systems are complex in design and may contain defects that are not detected until deployed by our customers, which could increase our costs and reduce our net sales.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Lasers and laser systems are inherently complex in design and require ongoing regular maintenance.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	The manufacture of our lasers, laser products and systems involves a highly complex and precise process.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	As a result of the technological complexity of our products, in particular the flat panel annealing systems, changes in our or our suppliers' manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective materials by us or our suppliers could result in a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and product reliability.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P10_S3	To the extent that we do not achieve and maintain our projected yields or product reliability, our business, operating results, financial condition and customer relationships would be adversely affected.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P10_S4	We provide warranties on a majority of our product sales, and reserves for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P10_S5	The determination of such reserves requires us to make estimates of failure rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P10_S6	We typically establish warranty reserves based on historical warranty costs for each product line.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P10_S7	If actual return rates and/or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates, adjustments to cost of sales may be required in future periods which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P10_S8	Our customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated, including under the end user's peak stress conditions.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P10_S9	In addition, some of our products are combined with products from other vendors, which may contain defects.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P10_S10	As a result, should problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P10_S11	If we are unable to identify and fix defects or other problems, we could experience, among other things:
21510_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	legal actions by our customers and/or their end users.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Continued volatility in the advanced packaging and semiconductor manufacturing markets could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P11_S3	A portion of our net sales in the microelectronics market depends on the demand for our products by advanced packaging applications and semiconductor equipment companies.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P11_S4	These markets have historically been characterized by sudden and severe cyclical variations in product supply and demand, which have often severely affected the demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment, including laser-based tools and systems.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P11_S5	The timing, severity and duration of these market cycles are difficult to predict, and we may not be able to respond effectively to these cycles.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P11_S6	The continuing uncertainty in these markets severely limits our ability to predict our business prospects or financial results in these markets.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P11_S7	During industry downturns, our net sales from these markets may decline suddenly and significantly.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P11_S8	Our ability to rapidly and effectively reduce our cost structure in response to such downturns is limited by the fixed nature of many of our expenses in the near term and by our need to continue our investment in next-generation product technology and to support and service our products.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P11_S9	In addition, due to the relatively long manufacturing lead times for some of the systems and subsystems we sell to these markets, we may incur expenditures or purchase raw materials or components for products we cannot sell.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P11_S10	Accordingly, downturns in the semiconductor capital equipment market may materially harm our operating results.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	increases in customer demand that may be extremely rapid, and if we fail to do so we may lose business to our competitors and our relationships with our customers may be harmed.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We are exposed to risks associated with worldwide economic conditions and related uncertainties which could negatively impact demand for our products and results of operations.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets, depressed consumer confidence, government economic policies, negative economic conditions, volatile corporate profits and reduced capital spending could negatively impact demand for our products.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P12_S3	In particular, it is difficult to develop and implement strategy, sustainable business models and efficient operations, as well as effectively manage supply chain relationships in the face of such conditions including uncertainty regarding the ability of some of our suppliers to continue operations and provide us with uninterrupted supply flow.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Our ability to maintain our research and development investments in our broad product offerings may be adversely impacted in the event that our sales decline and do not increase in the future.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Spending and the timing thereof by consumers and businesses have a significant impact on our results and, where such spending is delayed or canceled, it could have a material negative impact on our operating results.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Current global economic conditions remain uncertain and challenging.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Weakness in our end markets could negatively impact our net sales, gross margin and operating expenses, and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Uncertainty in global fiscal policy has likely had an adverse impact on global financial markets and overall economic activity.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Should this uncertain financial policy recur, it would likely negatively impact global economic activity.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Any weakness in global economies would also likely have negative repercussions on U.S. and global credit and financial markets, and further exacerbate sovereign debt concerns in the European Union.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P14_S3	All of these factors would likely adversely impact the global demand for our products and the performance of our investments, and would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets continues to negatively impact financial institutions and has resulted in tighter credit markets, and lower levels of liquidity in some financial markets.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	There could be a number of follow-on effects from the tightened credit environment on our business, including the insolvency of key suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and/or manufacture products resulting in product delays; inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and/or customer insolvencies; and failure of financial institutions negatively impacting our treasury functions.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	In the event our customers are unable to obtain credit or otherwise pay for our shipped products it could significantly impact our ability to collect on our outstanding accounts receivable.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments; impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments; interest rates; cash balances; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Volatility in the financial markets and any overall economic uncertainty increase the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Uncertainty about current global economic conditions could also continue to increase the volatility of our stock price.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P15_S6	In addition, political and social turmoil related to international conflicts, terrorist acts, civil unrest and mass migration may put further pressure on economic conditions in the United States and the rest of the world.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P15_S7	Unstable economic, political and social conditions make it difficult for our customers, our suppliers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P15_S8	If such conditions persist, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P15_S9	Additionally, unstable economic conditions can provide significant pressures and burdens on individuals, which could cause them to engage in inappropriate business conduct.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P15_S10	See Part II, Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are managed through various banks around the world and volatility in the capital and credit market conditions could cause financial institutions to fail or materially harm service levels provided by such banks, both of which could have an adverse impact on our ability to timely access funds.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	World capital and credit markets have been and may continue to experience volatility and disruption.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P16_S2	In some cases, the markets have exerted downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers, as well as pressured the solvency of some financial institutions.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P16_S3	These financial institutions, including banks, have had difficulty timely performing regular services and in some cases have failed or otherwise been largely taken over by governments.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We maintain our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments with a number of financial institutions around the world.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Should some or all of these financial institutions fail or otherwise be unable to timely perform requested services, we would likely have a limited ability to timely access our cash deposited with such institutions, or, in extreme circumstances the failure of such institutions could cause us to be unable to access cash for the foreseeable future.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P17_S2	If we are unable to quickly access our funds when we need them, we may need to increase the use of our existing credit lines or access more expensive credit, if available.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	impact on our operations, including our reported net income.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	In addition, the willingness of financial institutions to continue to accept our cash deposits will impact our ability to diversify our investment risk among institutions.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We are exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Although we have not recognized any material losses on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, future declines in their market values could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Given the global nature of our business, we have investments both domestically and internationally.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	There has recently been growing pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, particularly in Europe where a significant portion of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are invested, which results in corresponding pressure on the valuation of the securities issued by such nations.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Additionally, our overall investment portfolio is often concentrated in government-issued securities such as U.S. Treasury securities and government agencies, corporate notes, commercial paper and money market funds.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, financial results, or other factors.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Additionally, liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations could result in decreased values for our investments in certain government securities.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P20_S4	As a result, the value or liquidity of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments could decline or become materially impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P20_S5	See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to increase our sales volumes and decrease our costs to offset potential declines in the average selling prices ( ASPs ) of our products and, if we are unable to realize greater sales volumes and lower costs, our operating results may suffer.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Our ability to increase our sales volume and our future success depends on the continued growth of the markets for lasers, laser systems and related accessories, as well as our ability to identify, in advance, emerging markets for laser-based systems.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify, on a timely basis, new high-growth markets in the future.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Moreover, we cannot assure you that new markets will develop for our products or our customers' products, or that our technology or pricing will enable such markets to develop.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Future demand for our products is uncertain and will depend to a great degree on continued technological development and the introduction of new or enhanced products.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P21_S5	If this does not continue, sales of our products may decline and our business will be harmed.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P21_S6	We have in the past experienced decreases in the ASPs of some of our products.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P21_S7	As competing products become more widely available, the ASPs of our products may decrease.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P21_S8	If we are unable to offset any decrease in our ASPs by increasing our sales volumes, our net sales will decline.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P21_S9	In addition, to maintain our gross margins, we must continue to reduce the cost of manufacturing our products while maintaining their high quality.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	From time to time, our products, like many complex technological products, may fail in greater frequency than anticipated.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	This can lead to further charges, which can result in higher costs, lower gross margins and lower operating results.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Furthermore, as ASPs of our current products decline, we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements with higher margins.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P22_S3	If we cannot maintain our gross margins, our operating results could be seriously harmed, particularly if the ASPs of our products decrease significantly.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Our future success depends on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new and enhanced products that meet the needs of our customers.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Our current products address a broad range of commercial and scientific research applications in the photonics markets.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P22_S6	We cannot assure you that the market for these applications will continue to generate significant or consistent demand for our products.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P22_S7	Demand for our products could be significantly diminished by disrupting technologies or products that replace them or render them obsolete.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P22_S8	Furthermore, the new and enhanced products in certain markets generally continue to be smaller in size and have lower ASPs, and therefore, we have to sell more units to maintain revenue levels.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P22_S9	Accordingly, we must continue to invest in research and development in order to develop competitive products.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P22_S10	Our future success depends on our ability to anticipate our customers' needs and develop products that address those needs.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P22_S11	Introduction of new products and product enhancements will require that we effectively transfer production processes from research and development to manufacturing and coordinate our efforts with those of our suppliers to achieve volume production rapidly.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P22_S12	If we fail to transfer production processes effectively, develop product enhancements or introduce new products in sufficient quantities to meet the needs of our customers as scheduled, our net sales may be reduced and our business may be harmed.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P22_S13	We face risks associated with our foreign operations and sales that could harm our financial condition and results of operations.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P22_S14	For fiscal 2015 , fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 , 73% , 74% and 77% , respectively, of our net sales were derived from customers outside of the United States.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P22_S15	We anticipate that foreign sales, particularly in Asia, will continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales in the foreseeable future.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	A global economic slowdown or a natural disaster could have a negative effect on various foreign markets in which we operate, such as the earthquake, tsunami and resulting nuclear disaster in Japan and the flooding in Thailand in recent years.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Such a slowdown may cause us to reduce our presence in certain countries, which may negatively affect the overall level of business in such countries.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our foreign sales are primarily through our direct sales force.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Additionally, some foreign sales are made through foreign distributors and representatives.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Our foreign operations and sales are subject to a number of risks, including:
21510_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our business could also be impacted by international conflicts, terrorist and military activity, civil unrest and pandemic illness which could cause a slowdown in customer orders, cause customer order cancellations or negatively impact availability of supplies or limit our ability to timely service our installed base of products.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P25_S1	We are also subject to the risks of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, which could materially adversely affect the sales price of our products in foreign markets, as well as the costs and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P25_S2	While we use forward exchange contracts and other risk management techniques to hedge our foreign currency exposure, we remain exposed to the economic risks of foreign currency fluctuations.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P25_S3	We may not be able to protect our proprietary technology which could adversely affect our competitive advantage.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Maintenance of intellectual property rights and the protection thereof is important to our business.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P25_S5	We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P25_S6	Our patent applications may not be approved, any patents that may be issued may not sufficiently protect our intellectual property and any issued patents may be challenged by third parties.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P25_S7	Other parties may independently develop similar or competing technology or design around any patents that may be issued to us.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P25_S8	We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P25_S9	Further, we may be required to enforce our intellectual property or other proprietary rights through litigation, which, regardless of success, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management's attention.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P25_S10	Additionally, there may be existing patents of which we are unaware that could be pertinent to our business and it is not possible for us to know whether there are patent applications pending that our products might infringe upon since these applications are often not publicly available until a patent is issued or published.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P25_S11	We may, in the future, be subject to claims or litigation from third parties, for claims of infringement of their proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of competitors or other rights holders.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P25_S12	These claims could result in costly litigation and the diversion of our technical and management personnel.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P25_S13	Adverse resolution of litigation may harm our operating results or financial condition.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	In recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States and around the world involving patents and other intellectual property rights.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	between IMRA America, Inc. ("Imra") and IPG Photonics Corporation and in Imra's recently brought litigation against two of our German subsidiaries.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	From time to time, like many other technology companies, we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights, copyrights, trademark rights or other intellectual property rights which such third parties believe may cover certain of our products, processes, technologies or information.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	In the future, we may be a party to litigation to protect our intellectual property or as a result of an alleged infringement of others' intellectual property whether through direct claims or by way of indemnification claims of our customers, as, in some cases, we contractually agree to indemnify our customers against third-party infringement claims relating to our products.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P28_S2	These claims and any resulting lawsuit, if successful, could subject us to significant liability for damages or invalidation of our proprietary rights.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P28_S3	These lawsuits, regardless of their success, would likely be time-consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Any potential intellectual property litigation could also force us to do one or more of the following:
21510_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	redesign the products that use the technology.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P29_S1	If we are forced to take any of these actions or are otherwise a party to lawsuits of this nature, we may incur significant losses and our business may be seriously harmed.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P29_S2	We do not have insurance to cover potential claims of this type.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P29_S3	If our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Factors that may be considered in determining whether a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable include declines in our stock price and market capitalization or future cash flows projections.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P30_S3	A decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in market conditions, particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we used to calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units, could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an impairment charge.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Any such material charges, whether related to goodwill or purchased intangible assets, may have a material negative impact on our financial and operating results.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P30_S5	We depend on skilled personnel to operate our business effectively in a rapidly changing market, and if we are unable to retain existing or hire additional personnel when needed, our ability to develop and sell our products could be harmed.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P30_S6	Our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel will be a critical factor in determining whether we will be successful in the future.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Recruiting and retaining highly skilled personnel in certain functions continues to be difficult.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P31_S1	At certain locations where we operate, the cost of living is extremely high and it may be difficult to retain key employees and management at a reasonable cost.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P31_S2	We may not be successful in attracting, assimilating or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Our failure to attract additional employees and retain our existing employees could adversely affect our growth and our business.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and support personnel, any of whom may leave and our ability to effectively transition to their successors.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P31_S5	Our inability to retain or to effectively transition to their successors could harm our business and our results of operations.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P31_S6	The long sales cycles for our products may cause us to incur significant expenses without offsetting net sales.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P31_S7	Customers often view the purchase of our products as a significant and strategic decision.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P31_S8	As a result, customers typically expend significant effort in evaluating, testing and qualifying our products before making a decision to purchase them, resulting in a lengthy initial sales cycle.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P31_S9	While our customers are evaluating our products and before they place an order with us, we may incur substantial sales and marketing and research and development expenses to customize our products to the customers' needs.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P31_S10	We may also expend significant management efforts, increase manufacturing capacity and order long lead-time components or materials prior to receiving an order.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P31_S11	Even after this evaluation process, a potential customer may not purchase our products.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P31_S12	As a result, these long sales cycles may cause us to incur significant expenses without ever receiving net sales to offset such expenses.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The markets in which we sell our products are intensely competitive and increased competition could cause reduced sales levels, reduced gross margins or the loss of market share.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Competition in the various photonics markets in which we provide products is very intense.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We compete against a number of large public and private companies, including CVI Melles Griot, GSI Group, Inc., IPG Photonics Corporation, Lumentum Holdings Inc., Newport Corporation, Rofin-Sinar Technologies, Inc., and Trumpf GmbH, as well as other smaller companies.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Some of our competitors are large companies that have significant financial, technical, marketing and other resources.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S3	These competitors may be able to devote greater resources than we can to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Some of our competitors are much better positioned than we are to acquire other companies in order to gain new technologies or products that may displace our product lines.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S5	Any of these acquisitions could give our competitors a strategic advantage.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S6	Any business combinations or mergers among our competitors, forming larger companies with greater resources, could result in increased competition, price reductions, reduced margins or loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S7	Additional competitors may enter the markets in which we serve, both foreign and domestic, and we are likely to compete with new companies in the future.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S8	We may encounter potential customers that, due to existing relationships with our competitors, are committed to the products offered by these competitors.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S9	Further, our current or potential customers may determine to develop and produce products for their own use which are competitive to our products.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S10	As a result of the foregoing factors, we expect that competitive pressures may result in price reductions, reduced margins, loss of sales and loss of market share.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S11	In addition, in markets where there are a limited number of customers, competition is particularly intense.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S12	If we fail to accurately forecast component and material requirements for our products, we could incur additional costs and incur significant delays in shipments, which could result in a loss of customers.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S13	We use rolling forecasts based on anticipated product orders and material requirements planning systems to determine our product requirements.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S14	It is very important that we accurately predict both the demand for our products and the lead times required to obtain the necessary components and materials.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S15	We depend on our suppliers for most of our product components and materials.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S16	Lead times for components and materials that we order vary significantly and depend on factors including the specific supplier requirements, the size of the order, contract terms and current market demand for components.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S17	For substantial increases in our sales levels of certain products, some of our suppliers may need at least nine months lead-time.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S18	If we overestimate our component and material requirements, we may have excess inventory, which would increase our costs.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S19	If we underestimate our component and material requirements, we may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt and delay delivery of our products to our customers.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S20	Any of these occurrences would negatively impact our net sales, business or operating results.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S21	Our reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing may adversely impact our financial results and operations due to our decreased control over the performance and timing of certain aspects of our manufacturing.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S22	Our manufacturing strategy includes partnering with contract manufacturers to outsource non-core subassemblies and less complex turnkey products, including some performed at international sites located in Asia and Eastern Europe.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S23	Our ability to resume internal manufacturing operations for certain products and components in a timely manner may be eliminated.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S24	The cost, quality, performance and availability of contract manufacturing operations are and will be essential to the successful production and sale of many of our products.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S25	Our financial condition or results of operation could be adversely impacted if any contract manufacturer or other supplier is unable for any reason, including as a result of the impact of worldwide economic conditions, to meet our cost, quality, performance, and availability standards.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S26	We may not be able to provide contract manufacturers with product volumes that are high enough to achieve sufficient cost savings.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S27	If shipments fall below forecasted levels, we may incur increased costs or be required to take ownership of the inventory.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S28	Also, our ability to control the quality of products produced by contract manufacturers may be limited and quality issues may not be resolved in a timely manner, which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S29	If we fail to effectively manage our growth or, alternatively, our spending during downturns, our business could be disrupted, which could harm our operating results.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S30	Growth in sales, combined with the challenges of managing geographically dispersed operations, can place a significant strain on our management systems and resources, and our anticipated growth in future operations could continue to place such a strain.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S31	The failure to effectively manage our growth could disrupt our business and harm our operating results.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S32	Our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in evolving markets requires an effective planning and management process.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S33	In economic downturns, we must effectively manage our spending and operations to ensure our competitive position during the downturn, as well as our future opportunities when the economy improves, remain intact.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P33_S34	The failure to effectively manage our spending and operations could disrupt our business and harm our operating results.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Historically, acquisitions have been an important element of our strategy.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P34_S1	However, we may not find suitable acquisition candidates in the future and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Any acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We have in the past made strategic acquisitions of other corporations and entities, as well as asset purchases, and we continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions of complementary companies, products and technologies.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P35_S1	In the event of any future acquisitions, we could:
21510_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	incur expenses related to impairment of goodwill and amortization.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Acquisitions also involve numerous risks, including:
21510_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	the failure to complete acquisitions even after signing definitive agreements which, among other things, would result in the expensing of potentially significant professional fees and other charges in the period in which the acquisition or negotiations are terminated.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P37_S1	We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify appropriate acquisition candidates, to integrate any businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future or achieve the anticipated benefits of such transactions, which may harm our business.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Our market is unpredictable and characterized by rapid technological changes and evolving standards demanding a significant investment in research and development, and, if we fail to address changing market conditions, our business and operating results will be harmed.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The photonics industry is characterized by extensive research and development, rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Because this industry is subject to rapid change, it is difficult to predict its potential size or future growth rate.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Our success in generating net sales in this industry will depend on, among other things:
21510_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	our ability to accurately predict and develop our products to meet industry standards.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P39_S1	For our fiscal years 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , our research and development costs were $81.5 million ( 10.2% of net sales), $79.1 million ( 10.0% of net sales) and $82.8 million ( 10.2% of net sales), respectively.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P39_S2	We cannot assure you that our expenditures for research and development will result in the introduction of new products or, if such products are introduced, that those products will achieve sufficient market acceptance or to generate sales to offset the costs of development.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Our failure to address rapid technological changes in our markets could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P39_S4	We are exposed to lawsuits in the normal course of business which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We are exposed to lawsuits in the normal course of our business, including product liability claims, if personal injury, death or commercial losses occur from the use of our products.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P40_S1	While we typically maintain business insurance, including directors' and officers' policies, litigation can be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations, including the potential impact of indemnification obligations for individuals named in any such lawsuits.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P40_S2	We may not, however, be able to secure insurance coverage on terms acceptable to us in the future.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P40_S4	An unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit, including a recall or redesign of products if ultimately determined to be defective, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P40_S5	We use standard laboratory and manufacturing materials that could be considered hazardous and we could be liable for any damage or liability resulting from accidental environmental contamination or injury.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P40_S6	Although most of our products do not incorporate hazardous or toxic materials and chemicals, some of the gases used in our excimer lasers and some of the liquid dyes used in some of our scientific laser products are highly toxic.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P40_S7	In addition, our operations involve the use of standard laboratory and manufacturing materials that could be considered hazardous.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P40_S8	Also, if a facility fire were to occur at our Sunnyvale, California site and were to spread to a reactor used to grow semiconductor wafers, it could release highly toxic emissions.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P40_S9	We believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with all federal, state and offshore regulations and standards.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P40_S10	However, the risk of accidental environmental contamination or injury from such materials cannot be entirely eliminated.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P40_S11	In the event of such an accident involving such materials, we could be liable for damages and such liability could exceed the amount of our liability insurance coverage and the resources of our business which could have an adverse effect on our financial results or our business as a whole.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P40_S12	Compliance or the failure to comply with current and future environmental regulations could cause us significant expense.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process or requiring design changes or recycling of products we manufacture.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P41_S1	If we fail to comply with any present and future regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities, the suspension of production or a prohibition on the sale of products we manufacture.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P41_S2	In addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment, or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations, including expenses associated with the recall of any non-compliant product and the management of historical waste.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P41_S3	From time to time new regulations are enacted, and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P41_S4	We continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P41_S5	These regulations include, for example, the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical substances ( REACH ), the Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive ( RoHS ) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive ( WEEE ) enacted in the European Union which regulate the use of certain hazardous substances in, and require the collection, reuse and recycling of waste from, certain products we manufacture.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P41_S6	This and similar legislation that has been or is in the process of being enacted in Japan, China, South Korea and various states of the United States may require us to re-design our products to ensure compliance with the applicable standards, for example by requiring the use of different types of materials.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P41_S7	These redesigns or alternative materials may detrimentally impact the performance of our products, add greater testing lead-times for product introductions or have other similar effects.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P41_S8	We believe we comply with all such legislation where our products are sold and we will continue to monitor these laws and the regulations being adopted under them to determine our responsibilities.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P41_S9	In addition, we are monitoring legislation relating to the reduction of carbon emissions from industrial operations to determine whether we may be required to incur any additional material costs or expenses associated with our operations.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P41_S10	We are not currently aware of any such material costs or expenses.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The SEC has promulgated rules requiring disclosure regarding the use of certain conflict minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and procedures regarding a manufacturer's efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P42_S1	The implementation of such rules has required us to incur additional expense and internal resources and may continue to do so in the future, particularly in the event that only a limited pool of suppliers are available to certify that products are free from conflict minerals.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Our failure to comply with any of the foregoing regulatory requirements or contractual obligations could result in our being directly or indirectly liable for costs, fines or penalties and third-party claims, and could jeopardize our ability to conduct business in the United States and foreign countries.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Our and our customers' operations would be seriously harmed if our logistics or facilities or those of our suppliers, our customers' suppliers or our contract manufacturers were to experience catastrophic loss.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Our and our customers' operations, logistics and facilities and those of our suppliers and contract manufacturers could be subject to a catastrophic loss from fire, flood, earthquake, volcanic eruption, work stoppages, power outages, acts of war, pandemic illnesses, energy shortages, theft of assets, other natural disasters or terrorist activity.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	A substantial portion of our research and development activities, manufacturing, our corporate headquarters and other critical business operations are located near major earthquake faults in Santa Clara, California, an area with a history of seismic events.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	detrimental impact to any of our operations, logistics or facilities could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and net sales and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P44_S1	While we have obtained insurance to cover most potential losses, after reviewing the costs and limitations associated with earthquake insurance, we have decided not to procure such insurance.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P44_S2	We believe that this decision is consistent with decisions reached by numerous other companies located nearby.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P44_S3	We cannot assure you that our existing insurance coverage will be adequate against all other possible losses.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P44_S4	Difficulties with our enterprise resource planning ( ERP ) system and other parts of our global information technology system could harm our business and results of operation.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P44_S5	If our network security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer's data or our data or our information technology systems, we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Like many modern multinational corporations, we maintain a global information technology system, including software products licensed from third parties.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Any system, network or Internet failures, misuse by system users, the hacking into or disruption caused by the unauthorized access by third parties or loss of license rights could disrupt our ability to timely and accurately manufacture and ship products or to report our financial information in compliance with the timelines mandated by the SEC.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Any such failure, misuse, hacking, disruptions or loss would likely cause a diversion of management's attention from the underlying business and could harm our operations.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P45_S3	In addition, a significant failure of our global information technology system could adversely affect our ability to complete an evaluation of our internal controls and attestation activities pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Our information systems are subject to attacks, interruptions and failures.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P46_S1	As part of our day-to-day business, we store our data and certain data about our customers in our global information technology system.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P46_S2	While our system is designed with access security, if a third party gains unauthorized access to our data, including any regarding our customers, such a security breach could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, loss of business, litigation and possible liability.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Our security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P46_S4	Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers' data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P46_S5	Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P46_S6	Any unauthorized access could result in a loss of confidence by our customers, damage our reputation, disrupt our business, lead to legal liability and negatively impact our future sales.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P46_S7	Additionally, such actions could result in significant costs associated with loss of our intellectual property, impairment of our ability to conduct our operations, rebuilding our network and systems, prosecuting and defending litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages or taking other remedial steps.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P46_S8	Changes in tax rates, tax liabilities or tax accounting rules could affect future results.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries and jurisdictions.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Significant judgment is required to determine our worldwide tax liabilities.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P47_S2	A number of factors may affect our future effective tax rates including, but not limited to:
21510_15_ITEM1A_P48_S0	the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P48_S1	We are also engaged in discussions with various tax authorities regarding the appropriate level of profitability for Coherent entities and this may result in changes to our worldwide tax liabilities.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P48_S2	In addition, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) and other tax authorities.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P49_S0	From time to time the United States, foreign and state governments make substantive changes to tax rules and the application of rules to companies, including various announcements from the United States government potentially impacting our ability to defer taxes on international earnings.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P49_S1	We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Federal securities laws, rules and regulations, as well as the rules and regulations of self-regulatory organizations such as NASDAQ and the NYSE, require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures, impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements, set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers, chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P51_S1	These laws, rules and regulations have increased and will continue to increase the scope, complexity and cost of our corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices, which could harm our results of operations and divert management's attention from business operations.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P52_S1	New or changed laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P52_S2	As a result, their application in practice may evolve over time.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We are committed to maintaining high standards of ethics, corporate governance and public disclosure.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Complying with evolving interpretations of new or changed legal requirements may cause us to incur higher costs as we revise current practices, policies and procedures, and may divert management time and attention from revenue generating to compliance activities.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P53_S2	If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, our reputation may also be harmed.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P53_S3	Governmental regulations, including duties, affecting the import or export of products could negatively affect our net sales.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P54_S0	The United States and many foreign governments impose tariffs and duties on the import and export of products, including some of those which we sell.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P54_S1	In particular, given our worldwide operations, we pay duties on certain products when they are imported into the United States for repair work as well as on certain of our products which are manufactured by our foreign subsidiaries.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P54_S2	These products can be subject to a duty on the product value.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P54_S3	Additionally, the United States and various foreign governments have imposed tariffs, controls, export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies, especially encryption technology.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P54_S4	From time to time, government agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology, such as requiring the escrow and governmental recovery of private encryption keys.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P54_S5	Governmental regulation of encryption technology and regulation of imports or exports, or our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products, could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our net sales.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P54_S6	From time to time our duty calculations and payments are audited by government agencies.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P54_S7	For example, we are currently under audit in South Korea for customs duties and value-added-tax for the period March 2009 to March 2014.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P54_S8	In the event of an adverse audit result, we could be liable for additional payments, duties, taxes and penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P54_S9	As of October 3, 2015, we have accrued an estimated liability of $1.3 million related to this matter.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P54_S10	In addition, compliance with the directives of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls ( DDTC ) may result in substantial expenses and diversion of management.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P54_S11	Any failure to adequately address the directives of DDTC could result in civil fines or suspension or loss of our export privileges, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P54_S12	Failure to maintain effective internal controls may cause a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements or to cause us to delay filing our periodic reports with the SEC and adversely affect our stock price.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P55_S0	The SEC, as directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on Form 10-K that contain an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P55_S1	In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Although we test our internal control over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with the Section 404 requirements, our failure to maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements or a delay in our ability to timely file our periodic reports with the SEC, which ultimately could negatively impact our stock price.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P55_S3	Provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law, and our Change-of-Control Severance Plan may have anti-takeover effects that could prevent or delay a change in control.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P55_S4	Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition or make removal of incumbent directors or officers more difficult.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P55_S5	These provisions may discourage takeover attempts and bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P56_S0	establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a merger, asset or stock sale or other transaction with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date such person became an interested stockholder, unless prior approval of our board of directors is obtained or as otherwise provided.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P57_S1	These provisions of Delaware law also may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us without obtaining the prior approval of our board of directors, which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P58_S0	In addition, we have adopted a change of control severance plan, which provides for the payment of a cash severance benefit to each eligible employee based on the employee's position.
21510_15_ITEM1A_P58_S1	If a change of control occurs, our successor or acquirer will be required to assume and agree to perform all of our obligations under the change of control severance plan which may discourage potential acquirers or result in a lower stock price.

21510_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	(2) This facility is utilized primarily by our SLS operating segment.
21510_15_ITEM2_P0_S2	We currently plan to renew leases on buildings as they expire.
21510_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	We maintain other sales and service offices under varying leases expiring from 2016 through 2020 in Japan, China, Taiwan, France, Italy, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.
21510_15_ITEM2_P1_S1	We consider our facilities to be both suitable and adequate to provide for current and near term requirements and that the productive capacity in our facilities is substantially being utilized or we have plans to utilize it.
21510_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	The United States and many foreign governments impose tariffs and duties on the import and export of certain products we sell.
21510_15_ITEM3_P0_S1	From time to time our duty calculations and payments are audited by government agencies.
21510_15_ITEM3_P0_S2	We are currently under audit in South Korea for customs duties and value added tax for the period March 2009 to March 2014.
21510_15_ITEM3_P0_S3	Although we do not expect that the audit will ultimately have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, an adverse result in this matter could negatively affect our results in the period in which it occurs.
21510_15_ITEM3_P0_S4	As of October 3, 2015 , management has accrued an estimated liability of $1.3 million related to this matter.
21510_15_ITEM3_P1_S0	Income Tax Audits We are subject to taxation and file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions.
21510_15_ITEM3_P1_S1	For U.S. federal income tax purposes, all years prior to 2011 are closed.
21510_15_ITEM3_P1_S2	In our major foreign jurisdictions and our major state jurisdictions, the years prior to 2006 and 2011, respectively, are closed to examination.
21510_15_ITEM3_P1_S3	Earlier years in our various jurisdictions may remain open for adjustment to the extent that we have tax attribute carryforwards from those years.
21510_15_ITEM3_P1_S4	In December 2011 and January 2012, three of our German subsidiaries received notices of tax audits for the fiscal years 2006 through 2010.
21510_15_ITEM3_P1_S5	In fiscal 2013, we received a preliminary assessment for two of the German subsidiaries and the amount was immaterial.
21510_15_ITEM3_P1_S6	In September 2015, the German tax authorities issued preliminary tax findings for the other subsidiary for the years 2006 to 2010.
21510_15_ITEM3_P1_S7	We believe that we have adequately provided reserves for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.
21510_15_ITEM3_P1_S8	A meeting to discuss the findings with the German tax authorities is scheduled in December 2015.
21510_15_ITEM3_P2_S0	In July 2015, Coherent Kaiserslautern GmbH (formerly Lumera Laser GmbH) received a tax audit notice for the years 2010 to 2013.
21510_15_ITEM3_P2_S1	The audit began in August 2015.
21510_15_ITEM3_P2_S2	We acquired the shares of Lumera Laser GmbH in December 2012 and we should not have responsibility for any assessments related to the pre-acquisition period.
21510_15_ITEM3_P2_S3	Management believes that it has adequately provided reserves for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.
21510_15_ITEM3_P3_S0	We regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions.
21510_15_ITEM3_P3_S1	It is reasonably possible that certain federal, foreign and state tax matters may be concluded in the next 12 months.
21510_15_ITEM5_P0_S0	The number of stockholders of record as of November 30, 2015 was 780 .
21510_15_ITEM5_P0_S1	On December 10, 2012, we announced that the Board of Directors approved a $1.00 per share special cash dividend on our outstanding common stock payable on December 27, 2012 to stockholders of record on December 19, 2012, resulting in a payment of $24.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.
21510_15_ITEM5_P0_S2	While we paid a cash dividend in fiscal 2013 and may elect to pay dividends in the future, we have no present intention to declare cash dividends.
21510_15_ITEM5_P0_S3	Our line of credit agreement requires bank pre-approval for the payment of cash dividends.
21510_15_ITEM5_P0_S4	There were no sales of unregistered securities in fiscal 2015 .
21510_15_ITEM5_P0_S5	Stock repurchases during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 were as follows:
21510_15_ITEM5_P1_S0	(1) On January 21, 2015 and August 25, 2015 , the Board of Directors authorized buyback programs whereby the Company was authorized to repurchase up to $ 25.0 million of its common stock in each program from time to time through January 31, 2016 and August 31, 2016 , respectively.
21510_15_ITEM5_P1_S1	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company repurchased and retired outstanding common stock for a total of $50.0 million, completing both programs.
21510_15_ITEM5_P1_S2	Refer to Note 11 "Stock Repurchases and Dividends" of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of this annual report for discussion on additional repurchases during fiscal 2015.

21510_15_ITEM6_P0_S0	We derived the consolidated statement of operations data for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of fiscal 2015 and 2014 year-end from our audited consolidated financial statements, and accompanying notes, contained in this annual report.
21510_15_ITEM6_P0_S1	The consolidated statements of operations data for fiscal 2012 and 2011 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 year-end are derived from our consolidated financial statements which are not included in this report.
21510_15_ITEM6_P1_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ (1) Includes a charge of $1.3 million after tax for the impairment of our investment in SiOnyx, a $1.3 million after-tax charge for an accrual related to an ongoing customs audit, a benefit of $1.1 million from the renewal of the R D tax credit for fiscal 2014 and $1.3 million gain on our purchase of Tinsley in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
21510_15_ITEM6_P1_S1	(2) Includes a tax benefit of $1.4 million from the renewal of the R D tax credit for fiscal 2012.

21510_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS Below is a summary of some of the quantitative performance indicators (as defined below) that are evaluated by management to assess our financial performance.
21510_15_ITEM7_P0_S1	Some of the indicators are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered as an alternative to any other measure for determining operating performance that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
21510_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	Definitions and analysis of these performance indicators are as follows: Bookings and Book-to-Bill Ratio Bookings represent orders received during the current period for products and services to be provided pursuant to service contracts.
21510_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	While we generally have not experienced a significant rate of cancellation, bookings are generally cancelable by our customers without substantial penalty and, therefore, we cannot assure all bookings will be converted to net sales.
21510_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	The book-to-bill ratio is calculated as annual bookings divided by annual net sales.
21510_15_ITEM7_P2_S1	This is an indication of the strength of our business but can sometimes be impacted by a single large order or a single large shipment.
21510_15_ITEM7_P2_S2	A ratio greater than 1.0 indicates that demand for our products is greater than what we supply in the year whereas a ratio of less than 1.0 indicates that demand for our products is less than what we supply in the year.
21510_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	Fiscal 2015 bookings decreased 14% from bookings in fiscal 2014 and our book-to-bill ratio decreased from 1.12 in fiscal 2014 to 0.95 in fiscal 2015 .
21510_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	The bookings decrease included decreases in the microelectronics ( 19% ), OEM components and instrumentation ( 14% ), materials processing ( 8% ) and scientific ( 2% ) markets.
21510_15_ITEM7_P3_S2	Although fiscal 2015 bookings decreased, bookings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 increased 16% from the third quarter of fiscal 2015 , with increases in all four markets.
21510_15_ITEM7_P3_S3	Fiscal 2014 bookings increased 16% from bookings in fiscal 2013 and our book-to-bill ratio increased from 0.95 in fiscal 2013 to 1.12 in fiscal 2014 .
21510_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	instrumentation ( 19% ) markets partially offset by decreases in the materials processing ( 2% ) and scientific ( 2% ) markets.
21510_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	Although fiscal 2014 bookings increased, bookings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 decreased 25% from the third quarter of fiscal 2014 , with decreases in the microelectronics, OEM components and instrumentation and materials processing markets partially offset by increases in the scientific market.
21510_15_ITEM7_P4_S2	Although fiscal 2015 bookings decreased 19% from bookings in fiscal 2014 and the book-to-bill ratio for the year was 0.90 , bookings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 increased 7% from the third quarter of fiscal 2015 primarily due to increased systems orders net of lower service orders for the flat panel display market and higher semiconductor applications orders.
21510_15_ITEM7_P4_S3	Flat panel display orders for fiscal 2015 decreased 30% from orders in fiscal 2014 primarily due to the timing and mix of order placement by customers.
21510_15_ITEM7_P4_S4	Fourth quarter fiscal 2015 orders were higher than those in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher systems orders from liquid crystal display ("LCD") fabs for Linebeam 750s net of lower service bookings.
21510_15_ITEM7_P4_S5	We expect continued fluctuations in order volumes on a quarterly basis.
21510_15_ITEM7_P4_S6	We shipped the first, second and third Triple Vyper TM Linebeam 1500 systems in the first, second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2015, respectively.
21510_15_ITEM7_P4_S7	Subsequent to year-end, we received additional orders totaling approximately $45 million for a combination of single and twin Vyper systems.
21510_15_ITEM7_P4_S8	We expect significant opportunities to develop for organic light-emitting diode ("OLED") production as several smartphone manufacturers have either decided to or are evaluating a shift to OLED displays in their devices.
21510_15_ITEM7_P4_S9	Because of nuances in the manufacturing process, production of the highest resolution OLEDs has only been achieved with Twin Vyper /Linebeam 1300 or Triple Vyper/Linebeam 1500 systems.
21510_15_ITEM7_P4_S10	We expect any new OLED capacity would adhere to these standards.
21510_15_ITEM7_P4_S11	Our recent acquisition of Tinsley Optics provides a dedicated, cost-effective solution for large form optics to help facilitate deliveries.
21510_15_ITEM7_P4_S12	The combination of order volume and the customers ability to qualify and ramp production lines will extend into fiscal 2017.
21510_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	Advanced packaging ("API") orders increased 9% for the full fiscal year, but fourth quarter fiscal 2015 orders were flat from orders in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 .
21510_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	API equipment manufacturers have adopted a more cautionary posture for legacy products based on recent trends in the semiconductor market.
21510_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	We believe that flex packaging and system in package ("SiP") are two applications that are promising.
21510_15_ITEM7_P6_S2	Flex packaging, which relies upon UV lasers, is used in mobile and wearable devices and several systems manufacturers have seen strength in this area.
21510_15_ITEM7_P6_S3	SiP has been building momentum in mobile devices and future smartphones are likely to incorporate more SiP design elements, which will lead to an increase in ultrafast lasers for packaging.
21510_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	Orders from semiconductor capital equipment OEMs decreased 9% for fiscal 2015 , but were higher in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 compared to the prior quarter due to increases in wafer inspection applications.
21510_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	Service orders remain strong due to high utilization rates in most fabs and orders for new equipment are tied to specific end user investments.
21510_15_ITEM7_P7_S2	These positives have been mostly offset by falling chip prices that curb investment as well as another round of consolidation of OEMs and chip makers leading to the inevitable spending cost reductions.
21510_15_ITEM7_P7_S3	These factors are already included in our current run rate so we believe further downside risk is minimal.
21510_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	OEM Components and Instrumentation Bookings in fiscal 2015 decreased 14% from fiscal 2014 and the book-to-bill ratio for the year was 0.95 .
21510_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	However, orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 increased 34% from orders in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 due to strength in instrumentation applications.
21510_15_ITEM7_P8_S2	Instrumentation orders increased 17% for the full fiscal year and fourth quarter fiscal 2015 orders increased 90% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015 due to timing of orders.
21510_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	Our bioinstrumentation business has benefitted from growth in personalized medicine, which has driven sales in clinical flow cytometry for our OBIS and HOPS products.
21510_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	We are making further strides in the high-speed gene sequencing market where the throughput requirements are out-of-reach for visible diodes or LEDs.
21510_15_ITEM7_P9_S2	Our outlook for bioinstrumentation is positive and there is a modest resurgence in worldwide biopharmaceutical R D. Orders for medical OEM products decreased 41% for the full fiscal 2015 and fourth quarter fiscal 2015 orders decreased 30% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015.
21510_15_ITEM7_P9_S3	In spite of the decrease in orders, the medical OEM market remains strong.
21510_15_ITEM7_P9_S4	There are long-term opportunities on the therapeutic side of the instrumentation business, although there have been some short-term inventory corrections amid consumer confidence and China growth concerns, which we believe is a short-term effect.
21510_15_ITEM7_P9_S5	In terms of new opportunities, we are making steady progress in qualifying our Monaco product in various cataract platforms.
21510_15_ITEM7_P9_S6	A major research institution has achieved very encouraging initial results using our new CO laser for surgical procedures, citing the absorption characteristics of CO versus CO 2 as the key differentiator.
21510_15_ITEM7_P9_S7	In addition, our major dental customer has experienced positive customer reaction to its new product which contains our CO 2 laser.
21510_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	Annual bookings decreased 8% from fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 's book-to-bill ratio was 1.03 .
21510_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	However, bookings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 were strong and increased 28% from the prior quarter due to strength in non-metal cutting and marking applications.
21510_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	Bookings volumes in our materials processing business can vary significantly from quarter to quarter.
21510_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	We have been working to broaden our participation in the textile business, specifically for denim processing where lasers are used to create design elements including patterning, texture and color.
21510_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	We secured two volume orders for CO 2 lasers in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 that resulted in record orders for marking.
21510_15_ITEM7_P11_S3	Orders for cutting and converting were also strong, including a number of projects related to consumer packaging.
21510_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	The level of engagement with potential customers on our second generation fiber laser is encouraging and customer testing has gone well.
21510_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	We are still in the process of becoming qualified for deployment with various OEMs.
21510_15_ITEM7_P12_S2	We continue to view fiscal 2016 as a year for initial orders with a volume ramp occurring in fiscal 2017.
21510_15_ITEM7_P12_S3	Although fiscal 2015 orders decreased 2% from bookings in fiscal 2014 , the book-to-bill ratio for the year was 1.06 .
21510_15_ITEM7_P12_S4	Orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 increased 15% from the third quarter of fiscal 2015 as the European and U.S. markets delivered a typically strong performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 .
21510_15_ITEM7_P12_S5	The sequential order growth was led by our Chameleon product family for multi-photon imaging, especially in neuroscience, where the U.S. BRAIN initiative is driving investment.
21510_15_ITEM7_P12_S6	By contrast, we have seen limited benefit from Europe s Human Brain Project which emphasizes computer modeling over imaging.
21510_15_ITEM7_P12_S7	Amplifier orders for time-resolved studies came in strong across the three major geographies and we continued a near-term trend of securing orders for high-performance amplifiers from multi-user free electron and accelerator facilities with the recent orders coming from European labs.
21510_15_ITEM7_P12_S8	In addition, our core Astrella and Libra amplifier products did well particularly in the U.S. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
21510_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	Net Sales Net sales include sales of lasers, laser tools, related accessories and service.
21510_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	Net sales for fiscal 2015 increased 1.0% from fiscal 2014 .
21510_15_ITEM7_P13_S2	Net sales for fiscal 2014 decreased 1.9% from fiscal 2013 .
21510_15_ITEM7_P13_S3	For a description of the reasons for changes in net sales refer to the "Results of Operations" section below.
21510_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	Gross Profit as a Percentage of Net Sales Gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit percentage") is calculated as gross profit for the period divided by net sales for the period.
21510_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	Gross profit percentage for SLS increased to 45.3% in fiscal 2015 from 42.1% in fiscal 2014 and from 41.7% in fiscal 2013 .
21510_15_ITEM7_P14_S2	Gross profit percentage for CLC increased to 34.9% in fiscal 2015 from 33.9% in fiscal 2014 and decreased from 36.2% in fiscal 2013 .
21510_15_ITEM7_P14_S3	For a description of the reasons for changes in gross profit refer to the "Results of Operations" section below.
21510_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	Research and Development as a Percentage of Net Sales Research and development as a percentage of net sales ("R D percentage") is calculated as research and development expense for the period divided by net sales for the period.
21510_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	Management considers R D percentage to be an important indicator in managing our business as investing in new technologies is a key to future growth.
21510_15_ITEM7_P15_S2	R D percentage increased to 10.2% from 10.0% in fiscal 2014 and remained flat from 10.2% in fiscal 2013 .
21510_15_ITEM7_P15_S3	For a description of the reasons for changes in R D spending refer to the "Results of Operations" section below.
21510_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows primarily represents the excess of cash collected from billings to our customers and other receipts over cash paid to our vendors for expenses and inventory purchases to run our business.
21510_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	We believe that cash flows from operations are an important performance indicator because cash generation over the long term is essential to maintaining a healthy business and providing funds to help fuel growth.
21510_15_ITEM7_P16_S2	For a description of the reasons for changes in Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities refer to the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section below.
21510_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	Days Sales Outstanding in Receivables We calculate days sales outstanding ("DSO") in receivables as net receivables at the end of the period divided by net sales during the period and then multiplied by the number of days in the period, using 360 days for years.
21510_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	DSO in receivables indicates how well we are managing our collection of receivables, with lower DSO in receivables resulting in higher working capital availability.
21510_15_ITEM7_P17_S2	The more money we have tied up in receivables, the less money we have available for research and development, acquisitions, expansion, marketing and other activities to grow our business.
21510_15_ITEM7_P17_S3	Our DSO in receivables for fiscal 2015 increased to 63.8 days from 62.2 days in fiscal 2014 .
21510_15_ITEM7_P17_S4	The increase in DSO in receivables is primarily due to a higher concentration of sales in the last month of the fiscal year in Asia and the U.S. and slower collections in Asia partially offset by higher bad debt reserves in fiscal 2015.
21510_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	Annualized Fourth Quarter Inventory Turns We calculate annualized fourth quarter inventory turns as cost of sales during the fourth quarter annualized and divided by net inventories at the end of the fourth quarter.
21510_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	This indicates how well we are managing our inventory levels, with higher inventory turns resulting in more working capital availability and a higher return on our investments in inventory.
21510_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	The more money we have tied up in inventory, the less money we have available for research and development, acquisitions, expansion, marketing and other activities to grow our business.
21510_15_ITEM7_P18_S3	Our annualized fourth quarter inventory turns for fiscal 2015 increased to 3.0 turns from 2.9 turns in fiscal 2014 primarily due to timing of inventory shipments of large annealing laser systems partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates.
21510_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	Capital Spending as a Percentage of Net Sales Capital spending as a percentage of net sales ("capital spending percentage") is calculated as capital expenditures for the period divided by net sales for the period.
21510_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	Capital spending percentage indicates the extent to which we are expanding or improving our operations, including investments in technology and equipment.
21510_15_ITEM7_P19_S2	Management monitors capital spending levels as this assists management in measuring our cash flows, net of capital expenditures.
21510_15_ITEM7_P19_S3	Our capital spending percentage decreased to 2.8% in fiscal 2015 from 2.9% in fiscal 2014 and increased from 2.7% in fiscal 2013 .
21510_15_ITEM7_P19_S4	The fiscal 2015 decrease was primarily due to lower purchases of production-related assets.
21510_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	The fiscal 2014 increase was primarily due to higher purchases of production-related assets to support new product introductions and growth in Asia, particularly to support service and refurbishment capacity in South Korea and China.
21510_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	We define adjusted EBITDA as operating income adjusted for depreciation, amortization, stock compensation expenses, major restructuring costs and certain other non-operating income and expense items.
21510_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	Key initiatives to reach our goals for EBITDA improvements include utilization of our Asian manufacturing locations, rationalizing our supply chain and continued leveraging of our infrastructure.
21510_15_ITEM7_P21_S2	We utilize a number of different financial measures, both GAAP and non-GAAP, such as adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales, in analyzing and assessing our overall business performance, for making operating decisions and for forecasting and planning future periods.
21510_15_ITEM7_P21_S3	We consider the use of non-GAAP financial measures helpful in assessing our current financial performance and ongoing operations.
21510_15_ITEM7_P21_S4	While we use non-GAAP financial measures as a tool to enhance our understanding of certain aspects of our financial performance, we do not consider these measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial measures.
21510_15_ITEM7_P21_S5	We provide adjusted EBITDA in order to enhance investors' understanding of our ongoing operations.
21510_15_ITEM7_P21_S6	This measure is used by some investors when assessing our performance.
21510_15_ITEM7_P21_S7	Below is the reconciliation of our net income as a percentage of net sales to our adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales:

21510_15_ITEM7_P36_S3	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the amount of net sales and their relative percentages of total net sales by segment (dollars in thousands):
21510_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2015 increased $7.8 million , or 1% , compared to fiscal 2014 , with increases of $13.8 million , or 6% , in our CLC segment and decreases of $6.0 million , or 1% , in our SLS segment.
21510_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	Net sales for fiscal 2014 decreased $15.5 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2013, with decreases of $6.1 million, or 1%, in our SLS segment and decreases of $9.4 million, or 4%, in our CLC segment.
21510_15_ITEM7_P37_S2	Both the increase and decrease in CLC and SLS segment sales, respectively, included decreases due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
21510_15_ITEM7_P37_S3	The decrease in our SLS segment sales in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to lower shipments for medical, semiconductor, bioinstrumentation and advanced packaging applications partially offset by higher shipments of flat panel display annealing systems.
21510_15_ITEM7_P37_S4	The fiscal 2015 decrease includes an increase of $2.0 million, primarily in military applications, resulting from our acquisitions of Tinsley and Raydiance.
21510_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	nozzle drilling applications and lower materials processing applications sales partially offset by higher shipments for semiconductor and medical applications.
21510_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	The increase in our CLC segment sales from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to higher medical, bioinstrumentation and flat panel display application sales.
21510_15_ITEM7_P38_S2	The decrease in our CLC segment sales from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to lower advanced packaging sales due to market softness and lower military application sales partially offset by higher sales for medical and instrumentation applications.
21510_15_ITEM7_P38_S3	Our gross profit rate increased by 2.4% to 41.8% in fiscal 2015 from 39.4% in fiscal 2014 primarily due to favorable product margins (1.2%) resulting from favorable mix in the microelectronics market and the favorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations net of the impact of lower volumes in certain business units.
21510_15_ITEM7_P38_S4	In addition, the margin also benefited from lower warranty costs (0.6%) due to fewer warranty events in both segments, lower other costs (0.5%) due primarily to lower inventory charges as well as lower intangibles amortization (0.1%).
21510_15_ITEM7_P38_S5	Our gross profit rate decreased by 0.4% to 39.4% in fiscal 2014 from 39.8% in fiscal 2013 primarily due to unfavorable product margins (0.4%) resulting from unfavorable mix in the OEM and instrumentation and material processing markets in the CLC segment and unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates in the SLS segment as well as higher intangibles amortization (0.2%) due to the acquisitions of Lumera at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and Innolight in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 partially offset by lower warranty costs as a percentage of sales (0.2%) due to fewer warranty events in the SLS segment.
21510_15_ITEM7_P38_S6	Our gross profit rate has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors including market and product mix, pricing on volume orders, shipment volumes, our ability to manufacture advanced and more complex products, manufacturing efficiencies, excess and obsolete inventory write-downs, warranty costs, amortization of intangibles, pricing by competitors or suppliers, new product introductions, production volume, customization and reconfiguration of systems, commodity prices and foreign currency fluctuations, particularly the recent weakening of the Euro and a lesser extent, the Japanese Yen and South Korean Won.
21510_15_ITEM7_P38_S7	Our SLS gross profit rate increased by 3.2% to 45.3% in fiscal 2015 from 42.1% in fiscal 2014 primarily due to favorable product margins (1.7%), lower other costs (0.8%) primarily due to lower inventory charges net of the amortization of the inventory step up from the Tinsley and Raydiance acquisitions, lower warranty costs (0.6%) due to fewer warranty events and lower intangibles amortization expense (0.1%).
21510_15_ITEM7_P38_S8	The 1.7% product margin improvement resulted from favorable product mix in the microelectronics and OEM components and instrumentation markets as well as favorable service mix and the favorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations.
21510_15_ITEM7_P38_S9	Our SLS gross profit rate increased by 0.4% to 42.1% in fiscal 2014 from 41.7% in fiscal 2013 primarily due to lower warranty costs (0.8%) due to fewer warranty events and lower other costs (0.1%) due to inventory step up amortization from the acquisition of Lumera recorded in fiscal 2013 net of higher fiscal 2014 inventory provisions as a percentage of sales.
21510_15_ITEM7_P38_S10	The decreases were partially offset by higher intangibles amortization (0.3%) due to the acquisitions of Lumera at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and Innolight in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and the beginning of amortization of in-process research and development (IPR D) for Lumera in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 as well as unfavorable product cost (0.2%) due to higher scrap, rework and engineering change order variances, unfavorable mix in the microelectronics and medical markets and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
21510_15_ITEM7_P38_S11	Commercial Lasers and Components Our CLC gross profit rate increased by 1.0% to 34.9% in fiscal 2015 from 33.9% in fiscal 2014 primarily due to a favorable product margin (0.5%) and lower warranty costs (0.5%) due to fewer warranty events.
21510_15_ITEM7_P38_S12	The 0.5% product margin improvement resulted from favorable mix in the OEM components and instrumentation and materials processing markets partially offset by unfavorable yields in certain business units.
21510_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	Our CLC gross profit rate decreased by 2.3% to 33.9% in fiscal 2014 from 36.2% in fiscal 2013 primarily due to higher warranty costs (1.2%) due to the impact of a higher installed base on lower revenues in the advanced packaging market as well as new product introductions in the materials processing and OEM components and instrumentation markets, unfavorable product costs (1.0%) resulting from unfavorable mix in the OEM components and instrumentation and material processing markets and higher other costs (0.1%) due to slightly higher inventory provisions as a percentage of sales net of lower freight and duty.
21510_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the amount of operating expenses and their relative percentages of total net sales by the line items reflected in our consolidated statement of operations (dollars in thousands):
21510_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	Research and development Fiscal 2015 research and development ("R D") expenses increased $2.4 million , or 3% , from fiscal 2014 , and increased to 10.2% from 10.0% of sales.
21510_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	The $2.4 million increase was primarily due to $2.5 million higher project spending as a result of lower customer reimbursements for development projects and higher spending on various projects net of the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates as well as an increase of $0.6 million from the impact of the acquisitions of Tinsley and Raydiance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
21510_15_ITEM7_P41_S2	The increases were partially offset by $0.7 million lower other spending including lower charges for increases in deferred compensation plan liabilities with the related income for increases in deferred compensation assets recorded in other income (expense) and lower stock-based compensation expense.
21510_15_ITEM7_P41_S3	On a segment basis, SLS spending increased $0.8 million primarily due to higher net spending on projects due to lower customer reimbursements and the impact of the acquisitions of Tinsley and Raydiance partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
21510_15_ITEM7_P41_S4	CLC spending increased $2.1 million primarily due to higher spending on projects and lower customer reimbursements.
21510_15_ITEM7_P41_S5	Corporate and other spending decreased $0.5 million due to lower charges for increases in deferred compensation plan liabilities and lower stock-based compensation expense.
21510_15_ITEM7_P41_S6	Fiscal 2014 research and development ("R D") expenses decreased $3.7 million, or 4%, from fiscal 2013, and decreased to 10.0% from 10.2% of sales.
21510_15_ITEM7_P41_S7	The $3.7 million decrease was primarily due to $5.3 million lower project spending as a result of higher customer reimbursements for development projects net of higher spending on various projects and increased headcount.
21510_15_ITEM7_P41_S8	The decreases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and $0.4 million higher other spending including higher charges for increases in deferred compensation plan liabilities with the related expenses for decreases in deferred compensation assets recorded in other income (expense) and higher stock-based compensation expense.
21510_15_ITEM7_P41_S9	On a segment basis, SLS spending decreased $2.9 million primarily due to lower net spending on projects due to higher customer reimbursements net of higher other spending on projects partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates.
21510_15_ITEM7_P41_S10	CLC spending decreased $1.2 million primarily due lower spending on projects.
21510_15_ITEM7_P41_S11	Corporate and other spending increased $0.4 million due to higher charges for increases in deferred compensation plan liabilities and higher stock-based compensation expense.
21510_15_ITEM7_P41_S12	Selling, general and administrative Fiscal 2015 selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses decreased $4.2 million , or 3% , from fiscal 2014 .
21510_15_ITEM7_P41_S13	The decrease was primarily due to $3.7 million lower charges for increases in deferred compensation plan liabilities with the related income for increases in deferred compensation assets recorded in other income (expense) and $0.7 million lower stock-based compensation expense.
21510_15_ITEM7_P41_S14	The decreases were partially offset by $0.2 million higher other net variable spending due to higher payroll related spending from higher variable compensation, salaries and benefits, higher legal and consulting costs including costs related to acquisitions and higher bad debt expenses partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower demo amortization.
21510_15_ITEM7_P41_S15	On a segment basis, SLS segment expenses decreased $1.7 million primarily due to lower variable spending.
21510_15_ITEM7_P41_S16	CLC spending decreased $1.2 million primarily due to lower variable spending.
21510_15_ITEM7_P41_S17	Spending for Corporate and other decreased $1.3 million primarily due to lower charges for increases in deferred compensation plan liabilities and lower stock-based compensation expense partially offset by higher variable spending including legal and consulting costs related to acquisitions and higher payroll spending.
21510_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	Fiscal 2014 selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses increased $4.5 million, or 3%, from fiscal 2013.
21510_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	The increase was primarily due to $2.9 million higher payroll spending due to higher headcount and increased salaries and benefits, higher sales commissions due to changes in regional mix and higher variable compensation spending; $1.2 million higher charges for increases in deferred compensation plan liabilities with the related expenses for decreases in deferred compensation assets recorded in other income (expense); and $0.5 million related to the acquisitions of Lumera and Innolight in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.
21510_15_ITEM7_P42_S2	The increases were partially offset by $0.1 million lower other variable spending on consulting and legal costs for acquisitions and lower external sales representative commissions net of the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
21510_15_ITEM7_P42_S3	On a segment basis, SLS segment expenses increased $2.0 million primarily due to higher payroll spending, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and the acquisitions of Lumera and Innolight partially offset by lower external sales representative commissions.
21510_15_ITEM7_P42_S4	CLC spending increased $2.6 million primarily due to higher payroll spending and higher other variable spending partially offset by lower external sales representative commissions.
21510_15_ITEM7_P42_S5	Spending for Corporate and other decreased $0.1 million primarily due to lower legal and consulting related to acquisitions and lower other variable spending partially offset by higher charges for increases in deferred compensation plan liabilities and higher payroll spending.
21510_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	Gain on business combination On July 27, 2015, we acquired the assets and certain liabilities of the Tinsley Optics ("Tinsley") business from L-3 Communications Corporation for approximately $4.3 million , excluding transaction costs (See Note 3).
21510_15_ITEM7_P43_S1	The purchase price was lower than the fair value of net assets purchased, resulting in a gain of $1.3 million recorded in our consolidated statements of operations for our fiscal year 2015.
21510_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	Impairment of investment On June 8, 2010, we invested $2.0 million in SiOnyx, Inc., a privately-held company.
21510_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	The investment was included in other assets and was being carried on a cost basis.
21510_15_ITEM7_P44_S2	During the third quarter of fiscal 2015 we determined that our investment became other-than temporarily impaired.
21510_15_ITEM7_P44_S3	As a result, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $2.0 million to operating expense in our results of operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.
21510_15_ITEM7_P44_S4	Amortization of intangible assets Amortization of intangible assets decreased $0.8 million , or 22% , from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the completion of amortization of certain intangibles from prior acquisitions partially offset by amortization from the Raydiance acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
21510_15_ITEM7_P44_S5	Amortization of intangible assets decreased $1.7 million, or 33%, from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the completion of amortization of certain intangibles from the acquisition of Lumera and other prior acquisitions.
21510_15_ITEM7_P44_S6	Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net, decreased $3.5 million from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 .
21510_15_ITEM7_P44_S7	The decrease was primarily due to $4.6 million lower gains, net of expenses, on our deferred compensation plan assets partially offset by lower net foreign currency exchange losses ($0.9 million) and $0.2 million higher interest income due to higher balances of cash and short-term investments.
21510_15_ITEM7_P44_S8	Net foreign currency exchange losses decreased due to higher unhedged exposure in fiscal 2014 and the significant movement of the Japanese Yen versus the Euro in the last month of the first quarter of fiscal 2014.
21510_15_ITEM7_P44_S9	In addition, favorable changes in foreign exchange rates in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 compared to the timing of hedge contracts were partially offset by an unfavorable impact in fiscal 2015 due to the weakening of certain Asian currencies against the U.S. Dollar.
21510_15_ITEM7_P44_S10	Other income (expense), net, increased $3.8 million from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014.
21510_15_ITEM7_P44_S11	The increase was primarily due to $2.1 million higher gains, net of expenses, on our deferred compensation plan assets and higher net foreign currency exchange gains ($1.5 million) primarily due to more favorable movement in the Japanese Yen-Euro cross rate during fiscal 2014.
21510_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	Income taxes The effective tax rate on income before income taxes for fiscal 2015 of 23.3% was lower than the statutory rate of 35.0%.
21510_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	This was primarily due to differences related to the benefit of income subject to foreign tax rates that are lower than U.S. tax rates including South Korea and Singapore tax exemptions, the benefit of foreign tax credits and the benefit of federal research and development tax credits including renewal of the federal research and development tax credits for fiscal 2014.
21510_15_ITEM7_P45_S2	These amounts are partially offset by deemed dividend inclusions under the Subpart F tax rules, stock-based compensation not deductible for tax purposes and limitations on the deductibility of compensation under IRC Section 162(m).
21510_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	The effective tax rate on income before income taxes for fiscal 2014 of 25.4% was lower than the statutory rate of 35.0%.
21510_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	rates including South Korea and Singapore tax exemptions and the benefit of foreign tax credits.
21510_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	These amounts are partially offset by deemed dividend inclusions under the Subpart F tax rules, stock-based compensation not deductible for tax purposes and limitations on the deductibility of compensation under IRC Section 162(m).
21510_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	The effective tax rate on income before income taxes for fiscal 2013 of 20.5% was lower than the statutory rate of 35.0%.
21510_15_ITEM7_P48_S1	This was primarily due to differences related to the benefit of income subject to foreign tax rates that are lower than U.S. tax rates including South Korea and Singapore tax exemptions, the benefit of foreign tax credits, the benefit of the federal research and development tax credits including renewal of the federal research and development tax credits for fiscal 2012 and the benefit of releasing foreign tax reserves accrued under ASC 740-10 Income Taxes and related interest.
21510_15_ITEM7_P48_S2	These amounts are partially offset by deemed dividend inclusions under the Subpart F tax rules, stock-based compensation not deductible for tax purposes and limitations on the deductibility of compensation under IRC Section 162(m).
21510_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	During fiscal 2015, we increased our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by $1.2 million to $15.6 million primarily due to the reduced ability to utilize California and other states research and development tax credits.
21510_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	During fiscal 2014, we increased our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by $1.0 million to $14.4 million primarily due to the reduced ability to utilize California and other states research and development tax credits.
21510_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	In making the determination to record the valuation allowance, management considered the likelihood of future taxable income and feasible and prudent tax planning strategies to realize deferred tax assets.
21510_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	In the future, if we determine that we expect to realize deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the valuation allowance will affect income in the period such determination is made.
21510_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	Coherent Korea received the final approval for a High-Tech tax exemption in 2013 from the South Korean authorities and it is subject to capital contribution limitations.
21510_15_ITEM7_P51_S1	The impact of this tax exemption decreased South Korean income taxes by approximately $2.8 million (or $0.11 per diluted share) in fiscal 2015, $2.4 million (or $0.10 per diluted share) in fiscal 2014 and $2.1 million (or $0.09 per diluted share) in fiscal 2013.
21510_15_ITEM7_P51_S2	The remaining High-Tech tax exemption benefit is minimal and should be fully utilized in fiscal 2016 and Coherent Korea should be subject to South Korea income tax at that time.
21510_15_ITEM7_P51_S3	Coherent Singapore had previously received a Pioneer Status tax exemption from the Singapore authorities effective from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2017, and it may be extended if certain additional requirements are satisfied.
21510_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	The tax holiday is conditional upon our meeting certain revenue, business spending and employment thresholds.
21510_15_ITEM7_P52_S1	Although Coherent Singapore had income in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, these amounts were offset by a loss carryforward from fiscal 2012 and therefore we did not realize a cumulative benefit for the Singapore tax holiday.
21510_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity and capital resources At October 3, 2015 , we had assets classified as cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, in an aggregate amount of $325.5 million , compared to $318.3 million at September 27, 2014 .
21510_15_ITEM7_P53_S1	At October 3, 2015 , approximately $271.3 million of this cash and securities was held in certain of our foreign subsidiaries, $90.0 million of which was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
21510_15_ITEM7_P53_S2	We currently have approximately $263.3 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries where we intend to permanently reinvest our accumulated earnings in these entities and our current plans do not demonstrate a need for these funds to support our domestic operations.
21510_15_ITEM7_P53_S3	If, however, a portion of these funds were needed for and distributed to our operations in the United States, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes.
21510_15_ITEM7_P53_S4	The amount of the taxes due would depend on the amount and manner of repatriation, as well as the location from where the funds are repatriated.
21510_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	We actively monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold these assets, primarily focusing on the safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield on these assets.
21510_15_ITEM7_P54_S1	We diversify our cash and cash equivalents and investments among various financial institutions, money market funds, sovereign debt and other securities in order to reduce our exposure should any one of these financial institutions or financial instruments fail or encounter difficulties.
21510_15_ITEM7_P54_S2	To date, we have not experienced any material loss or lack of access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments.
21510_15_ITEM7_P54_S3	However, we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets.
21510_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	In the second quarter of fiscal 2015 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we converted $42.3 million and $62.7 million, respectively, of cash and securities held in certain of our foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars and invested those funds within a European subsidiary whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar.
21510_15_ITEM7_P55_S1	At October 3, 2015 , this subsidiary had $170.3 million of U.S. dollar denominated investments primarily in U.S. Treasury securities, corporate notes and commercial paper.
21510_15_ITEM7_P55_S2	In November 2015, we converted an additional $33.0 million of cash and securities held in certain of our foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars and invested those funds within a European subsidiary whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar.
21510_15_ITEM7_P55_S3	Accordingly, there is no translation expense arising from this entity holding U.S. dollar denominated investments.
21510_15_ITEM7_P55_S4	The converted funds are not intended to be repatriated to the U.S. and no U.S. tax was triggered on the transfer of these funds to the European subsidiary.
21510_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK below for more information about risks and trends related to foreign currencies.
21510_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	Sources and Uses of Cash Historically, our primary source of cash has been provided by operations.
21510_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	Other sources of cash in the past three fiscal years include proceeds received from the sale of our stock through our employee stock option and purchase plans.
21510_15_ITEM7_P57_S2	Our historical uses of cash have primarily been for the repurchase of our common stock, capital expenditures, acquisitions of businesses and technologies and the payment of a one-time cash dividend in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.
21510_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $33.1 million in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 and decreased by $24.1 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 .
21510_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	The increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to higher net income and higher cash flows from the timing of shipments of large systems from inventory partially offset by lower cash flows from prepaid income taxes and accounts receivable.
21510_15_ITEM7_P58_S2	The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2014 was primarily due to lower cash flows from the timing of inventory purchases to support new products and accounts payable, lower net income, lower cash flows from the timing of accounts receivable due to higher days sales outstanding and lower income from operations partially offset by higher cash flows from the timing of other current liabilities.
21510_15_ITEM7_P58_S3	We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short term investments combined with cash to be provided by operating activities will be adequate to cover our working capital needs and planned capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months to the extent such items are known or are reasonably determinable based on current business and market conditions.
21510_15_ITEM7_P58_S4	However, we may elect to finance certain of our capital expenditure requirements through borrowings under our bank credit facilities or other sources of capital.
21510_15_ITEM7_P58_S5	We continue to follow our strategy to further strengthen our financial position by using available cash flow to fund operations.
21510_15_ITEM7_P58_S6	We intend to continue pursuing acquisition opportunities at valuations we believe are reasonable based upon market conditions.
21510_15_ITEM7_P58_S7	However, we cannot accurately predict the timing, size and success of our acquisition efforts or our associated potential capital commitments.
21510_15_ITEM7_P58_S8	Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire businesses on terms acceptable to us.
21510_15_ITEM7_P58_S9	We expect to fund future acquisitions primarily through existing cash balances and cash flows from operations.
21510_15_ITEM7_P58_S10	If required, we will look for additional borrowings or consider the issuance of securities.
21510_15_ITEM7_P58_S11	The extent to which we will be willing or able to use our common stock to make acquisitions will depend on its market value at the time and the willingness of potential sellers to accept it as full or partial payment.
21510_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	On July 24, 2015, we acquired certain assets of Raydiance for approximately $5.0 million, excluding transaction costs.
21510_15_ITEM7_P59_S1	On July 27, 2015, we acquired the assets and certain liabilities of the Tinsley business from L-3 Communications Corporation for approximately $4.3 million, excluding transaction costs.
21510_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	On December 10, 2012, we announced that the Board of Directors approved a $1.00 per share special cash dividend on our outstanding common stock payable on December 27, 2012 to stockholders of record on December 19, 2012, resulting in a payment of $24.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.
21510_15_ITEM7_P60_S1	We do not expect to pay any additional dividends in the foreseeable future.
21510_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	In fiscal 2015, under plans authorized by the Board of Directors, we repurchased and retired 1,302,323 shares of outstanding common stock at an average price of $57.59 per share for a total of $75.0 million .
21510_15_ITEM7_P61_S1	Additional sources of cash available to us were domestic and international currency lines of credit and bank credit facilities totaling $63.2 million as of October 3, 2015 , of which $60.6 million was unused and available.
21510_15_ITEM7_P61_S2	These unsecured credit facilities were used in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China during fiscal 2015 .
21510_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	ratios and tangible net worth and we were in compliance with these covenants at October 3, 2015 .
21510_15_ITEM7_P62_S1	We have used $1.1 million for letters of credit against our domestic line of credit and $1.5 million of the international currency lines has been used as guarantees as of October 3, 2015 .
21510_15_ITEM7_P62_S2	In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we have drawn $5.0 million on our domestic line of credit.
21510_15_ITEM7_P62_S3	Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 5.6 :1 at October 3, 2015 , compared to 5.8 :1 at September 27, 2014 .
21510_15_ITEM7_P62_S4	The decrease in our ratio is primarily due to increases in other current liabilities and taxes payable as well as decreases in inventories partially offset by increases in cash and short-term investments and accounts receivable.
21510_15_ITEM7_P62_S5	Our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and working capital are as follows (in thousands):
21510_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933.
21510_15_ITEM7_P63_S1	The following summarizes our contractual obligations at October 3, 2015 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):
21510_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	Because of the uncertainty as to the timing of such payments, we have excluded cash payments related to our contractual obligations for our deferred compensation plans aggregating $28.2 million at October 3, 2015 .
21510_15_ITEM7_P64_S1	As of October 3, 2015 , we recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $24.3 million including gross interest and penalties of $1.8 million .
21510_15_ITEM7_P64_S2	As of September 27, 2014 , we recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $23.7 million including gross interest and penalties of $1.8 million .
21510_15_ITEM7_P64_S3	Both gross unrecognized tax benefits and gross interest and penalties are classified as non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
21510_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.
21510_15_ITEM7_P65_S1	As a result, these amounts are not included in the table above.
21510_15_ITEM7_P65_S2	Changes in financial condition Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015 was $124.5 million , which included net income of $76.4 million , depreciation and amortization of $33.1 million , stock-based compensation expense of $18.2 million , the impairment of our investment in SiOnyx of $2.0 million , decreases in net deferred tax assets of $0.8 million and $0.6 million other, partially offset by cash used by operating assets and liabilities of $5.3 million and the net effect of the gain from acquisition of Tinsley of $1.3 million .
21510_15_ITEM7_P65_S3	Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2014 was $91.4 million, which included net income of $59.1 million, depreciation and amortization of $36.2 million and stock-based compensation expense of $18.9 million partially offset by cash used by operating assets and liabilities of $13.3 million, increases in net deferred tax assets of $8.2 million and $1.3 million other.
21510_15_ITEM7_P65_S4	Cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2015 of $3.2 million included $33.5 million net sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities partially offset by $21.0 million , net, used to acquire property and equipment and improve buildings net of proceeds from dispositions and $ 9.3 million used to acquire Tinsley and Raydiance.
21510_15_ITEM7_P65_S5	Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2014 of $109.8 million included $22.8 million, net, used to acquire property and equipment and improve buildings net of proceeds from dispositions and $87.0 million net purchases of available-for-sale securities.
21510_15_ITEM7_P65_S6	Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2015 was $73.0 million , which included $75.0 million repurchases of common stock and $5.3 million outflows due to net settlement of restricted stock partially offset by $7.3 million generated from our employee stock option and purchase plans.
21510_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	included $10.7 million generated from our employee stock option and purchase plans partially offset by $7.8 million outflows due to net settlement of restricted stock.
21510_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	Changes in exchange rates in fiscal 2015 resulted in a decrease in cash balances of $15.2 million .
21510_15_ITEM7_P67_S1	Changes in exchange rates in fiscal 2014 resulted in a decrease in cash balances of $3.7 million RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 2.
21510_15_ITEM7_P67_S2	"Significant Accounting Policies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the respective dates of adoption or expected adoption and effects on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
21510_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.
21510_15_ITEM7_P68_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
21510_15_ITEM7_P68_S2	We have identified the following as the items that require the most significant judgment and often involve complex estimation: revenue recognition, accounting for long-lived assets (including goodwill and intangible assets), inventory valuation, warranty reserves, stock-based compensation and accounting for income taxes.
21510_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered or the service has been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable.
21510_15_ITEM7_P69_S1	Revenue from product sales is recorded when all of the foregoing conditions are met and risk of loss and title passes to the customer.
21510_15_ITEM7_P69_S2	Our products typically include a warranty and the estimated cost of product warranty claims (based on historical experience) is recorded at the time the sale is recognized.
21510_15_ITEM7_P69_S3	Sales to customers are generally not subject to any price protection or return rights.
21510_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	The majority of our sales are made to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), distributors, representatives and end-users in the non-scientific market.
21510_15_ITEM7_P70_S1	Sales made to these customers do not require installation of the products by us and are not subject to other post-delivery obligations, except in occasional instances where we have agreed to perform installation or provide training.
21510_15_ITEM7_P70_S2	In those instances, we defer revenue related to installation services or training until these services have been rendered.
21510_15_ITEM7_P70_S3	We allocate revenue from multiple element arrangements to the various elements based upon fair values or a selling price hierarchy, as more fully described in Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition," in our consolidated financial statements.
21510_15_ITEM7_P70_S4	Should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions, revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected.
21510_15_ITEM7_P70_S5	Failure to obtain anticipated orders due to delays or cancellations of orders could have a material adverse effect on our revenue.
21510_15_ITEM7_P70_S6	In addition, pressures from customers to reduce our prices or to modify our existing sales terms may have a material adverse effect on our revenue in future periods.
21510_15_ITEM7_P70_S7	Our sales to distributors, representatives and end-user customers typically do not have customer acceptance provisions and only certain of our sales to OEM customers and integrators have customer acceptance provisions.
21510_15_ITEM7_P70_S8	Customer acceptance is generally limited to performance under our published product specifications.
21510_15_ITEM7_P70_S9	For the few product sales that have customer acceptance provisions because of higher than published specifications, (1) the products are tested and accepted by the customer at our site or the customer accepts the results of our testing program prior to shipment to the customer, or (2) the revenue is deferred until customer acceptance occurs.
21510_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	Sales to end-users in the scientific market typically require installation and, thus, involve post-delivery obligations; however our post-delivery installation obligations are not essential to the functionality of our products.
21510_15_ITEM7_P71_S1	We defer revenue related to installation services until completion of these services.
21510_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	For most products, training is not provided; therefore, no post-delivery training obligation exists.
21510_15_ITEM7_P72_S1	However, when training is provided to our customers, it is typically priced separately and recognized as revenue as these services are provided.
21510_15_ITEM7_P72_S2	For multiple element arrangements which include extended maintenance contracts, we allocate and defer the amount of consideration equal to the separately stated price and recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
21510_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	We evaluate long-lived assets and amortizable intangible assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances or our planned use of assets indicate that their carrying amounts may not be fully recoverable or that their useful lives are no longer appropriate.
21510_15_ITEM7_P73_S1	Reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying values of the assets are impaired based on comparison to the undiscounted expected future cash flows identifiable to such long-lived and amortizable intangible assets.
21510_15_ITEM7_P73_S2	If the comparison indicates that impairment exists, the impaired asset is written down to its fair value.
21510_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	We have determined that our reporting units are the same as our operating segments as each constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results.
21510_15_ITEM7_P74_S1	We make this determination in a manner consistent with how the operating segments are managed.
21510_15_ITEM7_P74_S2	Based on this analysis, we have identified two reporting units which are our reportable segments: SLS and CLC.
21510_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and written down when impaired (see Note 7 "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).
21510_15_ITEM7_P75_S1	We generally perform our annual impairment tests during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter, with any resulting impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.
21510_15_ITEM7_P75_S2	In fiscal 2013, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test.
21510_15_ITEM7_P75_S3	This election was made because we had last performed this detailed impairment test in fiscal 2010 and we had subsequently added a substantial amount of goodwill balances as a result of our acquisitions of Midaz in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and the acquisitions of Innolight and Lumera in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.
21510_15_ITEM7_P75_S4	We performed our Step 1 test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and noted no impairment.
21510_15_ITEM7_P75_S5	Management completed and reviewed the results of the Step 1 analysis and concluded that a Step 2 analysis was not required as the estimated fair values of both of our reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values.
21510_15_ITEM7_P75_S6	Between the completion of that testing and the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we noted no indications of impairment or triggering events to cause us to review goodwill for potential impairment.
21510_15_ITEM7_P75_S7	In fiscal 2014 and 2015, we conducted a qualitative assessment of the goodwill in the SLS reporting unit during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount.
21510_15_ITEM7_P75_S8	In assessing the qualitative factors, we considered the impact of these key factors: macroeconomic conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency, market and industry conditions, our operating and competitive environment, regulatory and political developments, the overall financial performance of our reporting units including cost factors and budgeted-to-actual revenue results.
21510_15_ITEM7_P75_S9	We also considered our market capitalization, stock price performance and the significant excess calculated in the prior year between estimated fair value and the carrying value of SLS.
21510_15_ITEM7_P75_S10	Based on our assessment, goodwill in the SLS reporting unit was not impaired as of the first day of the fourth quarter of both fiscal 2014 and 2015.
21510_15_ITEM7_P75_S11	As such, it was not necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test at that time in either fiscal year.
21510_15_ITEM7_P75_S12	For our CLC reporting unit we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment in fiscal 2014 and proceeded directly to performing the first step of goodwill impairment.
21510_15_ITEM7_P75_S13	The election was made in consideration of the lower financial performance of the reporting unit when compared to fiscal 2013, mostly due to softness in market conditions, predominantly in the advanced packaging market.
21510_15_ITEM7_P76_S0	We performed the Step 1 test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.
21510_15_ITEM7_P76_S1	We determined the fair value of the reporting unit for the Step 1 test using a 50-50% weighting of the Income (discounted cash flow) approach and Market (market comparable) approach.
21510_15_ITEM7_P77_S0	The Income approach utilizes the discounted cash flow model to provide an estimation of fair value based on the cash flows that a business expects to generate.
21510_15_ITEM7_P77_S1	These cash flows are based on forecasts developed internally by management which are then discounted at an after tax rate of return required by equity and debt market participants of a business enterprise.
21510_15_ITEM7_P77_S2	This rate of return or cost of capital is weighted based on the capitalization of comparable companies.
21510_15_ITEM7_P78_S0	The Market approach determines fair value by comparing the reporting units to comparable companies in similar lines of business that are publicly traded.
21510_15_ITEM7_P78_S1	Total Enterprise Value (TEV) multiples such as TEV to revenues and TEV to earnings (if applicable) before interest and taxes of the publicly traded companies are calculated.
21510_15_ITEM7_P78_S2	These multiples are then applied to the reporting unit's operating results to obtain an estimate of fair value.
21510_15_ITEM7_P78_S3	Each of these two approaches captures aspects of value in each reporting unit.
21510_15_ITEM7_P78_S4	The Income approach captures our expected future performance, and the Market approach captures how investors view the reporting units through other competitors.
21510_15_ITEM7_P78_S5	We believe these valuation approaches are proven valuation techniques and methodologies for our industry and are widely accepted by investors.
21510_15_ITEM7_P78_S6	As neither was perceived by us to deliver any greater indication of value than the other, and neither approach individually computed a fair value less than the carrying value of the segment, we weighted each of the approaches equally.
21510_15_ITEM7_P78_S7	Management completed and reviewed the results of the Step 1 analysis and concluded that a Step 2 analysis was not required as the estimated fair value of the CLC reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value.
21510_15_ITEM7_P79_S0	For our CLC reporting unit we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment in fiscal 2015 and proceeded directly to performing the first step of goodwill impairment.
21510_15_ITEM7_P79_S1	Although the reporting unit had better financial performance in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, such performance was not significant enough to justify performing only a qualitative assessment in fiscal 2015.
21510_15_ITEM7_P79_S2	Accordingly, we performed the Step 1 test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
21510_15_ITEM7_P79_S3	We determined the fair value of the reporting unit for the Step 1 test using a 50-50% weighting of the Income (discounted cash flow) approach and Market (market comparable) approach.
21510_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	The Income approach utilizes the discounted cash flow model to provide an estimation of fair value based on the cash flows that a business expects to generate.
21510_15_ITEM7_P80_S1	These cash flows are based on forecasts developed internally by management which are then discounted at an after tax rate of return required by equity and debt market participants of a business enterprise.
21510_15_ITEM7_P80_S2	This rate of return or cost of capital is weighted based on the capitalization of comparable companies.
21510_15_ITEM7_P81_S0	The Market approach determines fair value by comparing the reporting units to comparable companies in similar lines of business that are publicly traded.
21510_15_ITEM7_P81_S1	Total Enterprise Value (TEV) multiples such as TEV to revenues and TEV to earnings (if applicable) before interest and taxes of the publicly traded companies are calculated.
21510_15_ITEM7_P81_S2	These multiples are then applied to the reporting unit's operating results to obtain an estimate of fair value.
21510_15_ITEM7_P81_S3	Each of these two approaches captures aspects of value in each reporting unit.
21510_15_ITEM7_P81_S4	The Income approach captures our expected future performance, and the Market approach captures how investors view the reporting units through other competitors.
21510_15_ITEM7_P81_S5	We believe these valuation approaches are proven valuation techniques and methodologies for our industry and are widely accepted by investors.
21510_15_ITEM7_P81_S6	As neither was perceived by us to deliver any greater indication of value than the other, and neither approach individually computed a fair value less than the carrying value of the segment, we weighted each of the approaches equally.
21510_15_ITEM7_P81_S7	Management completed and reviewed the results of the Step 1 analysis and concluded that a Step 2 analysis was not required as the estimated fair value of the CLC reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value.
21510_15_ITEM7_P81_S8	Between the completion of that testing and the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we noted no indications of impairment or triggering events for either reporting unit to cause us to review goodwill for potential impairment.
21510_15_ITEM7_P81_S9	At October 3, 2015 , we had $101.8 million of goodwill ( $95.5 million SLS and $6.4 million in CLC), $22.8 million of purchased intangible assets and $102.4 million of property and equipment on our consolidated balance sheet.
21510_15_ITEM7_P82_S0	Inventory Valuation We record our inventory at the lower of cost (computed on a first-in, first-out basis) or market.
21510_15_ITEM7_P82_S1	We write-down our inventory to its estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
21510_15_ITEM7_P82_S2	Inventory write-downs are generally recorded within guidelines set by management when the inventory for a device exceeds 12 months of its demand or when management has deemed parts are no longer active or useful.
21510_15_ITEM7_P82_S3	If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required which could materially affect our future results of operations.
21510_15_ITEM7_P82_S4	Due to rapidly changing forecasts and orders, additional write-downs for excess or obsolete inventory, while not currently expected, could be required in the future.
21510_15_ITEM7_P82_S5	In the event that alternative future uses of fully written down inventories are identified, we may experience better than normal profit margins when such inventory is sold.
21510_15_ITEM7_P82_S6	Differences between actual results and previous estimates of excess and obsolete inventory could materially affect our future results of operations.
21510_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	We write-down our demo inventory by amortizing the cost of demo inventory over a twenty month period starting from the fourth month after such inventory is placed in service.
21510_15_ITEM7_P83_S1	We provide warranties on the majority of our product sales and allowances for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale.
21510_15_ITEM7_P83_S2	The determination of such allowances requires us to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty.
21510_15_ITEM7_P83_S3	We currently establish warranty reserves based on historical warranty costs for each product line.
21510_15_ITEM7_P83_S4	The weighted average warranty period covered is approximately 15 months.
21510_15_ITEM7_P83_S5	If actual return rates and/or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates, adjustments to cost of sales may be required in future periods.
21510_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation using fair value.
21510_15_ITEM7_P84_S1	We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes Merton model and estimate the fair value of performance restricted stock units granted using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
21510_15_ITEM7_P84_S2	We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.
21510_15_ITEM7_P84_S3	We amortize the fair value of stock options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods.
21510_15_ITEM7_P84_S4	We value service-based restricted stock units using the intrinsic value method and amortize the value on a straight-line basis over the restriction period.
21510_15_ITEM7_P84_S5	We value performance restricted stock units using a Monte Carlo simulation model and amortize the value over the performance period, with no adjustment in future periods, based upon the actual shareholder return over the performance period.
21510_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") requires the use of option pricing models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options.
21510_15_ITEM7_P86_S0	estimating the fair value of short-lived exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
21510_15_ITEM7_P86_S1	In addition, option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the options expected life, the expected price volatility of the underlying stock and an estimate of expected forfeitures.
21510_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	Our computation of expected volatility considers historical volatility and market-based implied volatility.
21510_15_ITEM7_P87_S1	Our estimate of expected forfeitures is based on historical employee data and could differ from actual forfeitures.
21510_15_ITEM7_P87_S2	See Note 12 "Employee Stock Award, Option and Benefit Plans" in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our stock-based employee compensation plans and the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of stock-based employee compensation.
21510_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income tax provision (benefit) in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
21510_15_ITEM7_P88_S1	This process involves us estimating our current income tax provision (benefit) together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
21510_15_ITEM7_P88_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets.
21510_15_ITEM7_P89_S0	We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized.
21510_15_ITEM7_P89_S1	While we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made.
21510_15_ITEM7_P89_S2	Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.
21510_15_ITEM7_P90_S0	Federal and state income taxes have not been provided for on a portion of the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested.
21510_15_ITEM7_P90_S1	The total amount of unremitted earnings (including accumulated translation adjustments) of foreign subsidiaries for which we have not yet recorded federal and state income taxes was approximately $471.9 million at fiscal 2015 year-end.
21510_15_ITEM7_P90_S2	The amount of federal and state income taxes that would be payable upon repatriation of such earnings is not practicably determinable.
21510_15_ITEM7_P90_S3	We have not, nor do we anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the United States to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business.
21510_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
21510_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
21510_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Interest rate sensitivity A portion of our investment portfolio is composed of fixed income securities.
21510_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase.
21510_15_ITEM7A_P1_S2	If interest rates were to increase immediately (whether due to changes in overall market rates or credit worthiness of the issuers of our individual securities) and uniformly by 10% from levels at fiscal 2015 year-end, the fair value of the portfolio, based on quoted market prices in active markets involving similar assets, would decline by an immaterial amount due to their short-term maturities.
21510_15_ITEM7A_P1_S3	We have the ability to generally hold our fixed income investments until maturity and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio.
21510_15_ITEM7A_P1_S4	If necessary, we may sell short-term investments prior to maturity to meet our liquidity needs.
21510_15_ITEM7A_P1_S5	At fiscal 2015 year-end, the fair value of our available-for-sale debt securities was $178.4 million , all of which was classified as short-term investments.
21510_15_ITEM7A_P1_S6	Gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities were $1.1 million and $(2,000) , respectively, at fiscal 2015 year-end.
21510_15_ITEM7A_P1_S7	At fiscal 2014 year-end, the fair value of our available-for-sale debt securities was $227.1 million, all of which was classified as short-term investments.
21510_15_ITEM7A_P1_S8	Gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities were $1.0 million and $(45,000), respectively, at fiscal 2014 year-end.
21510_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Foreign currency exchange risk We maintain operations in various countries outside of the United States and have foreign subsidiaries that manufacture and sell our products in various global markets.
21510_15_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The majority of our sales are transacted in U.S. dollars.
21510_15_ITEM7A_P2_S2	However, we do generate revenues in other currencies, primarily the Euro, Japanese Yen, the South Korean Won and the Chinese Renminbi.
21510_15_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Additionally, we have operations in different countries around the world with costs incurred in other local currencies, such as British Pound Sterling, Singapore Dollars and Malaysian Ringgit.
21510_15_ITEM7A_P3_S1	As a result, our earnings, cash flows and cash balances are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
21510_15_ITEM7A_P3_S2	For example, we have significant manufacturing operations in Europe so that a weakening Euro is advantageous to our financial results.
21510_15_ITEM7A_P3_S3	We attempt to limit these exposures through financial market instruments.
21510_15_ITEM7A_P3_S4	We utilize derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts with maturities of two months or less, to manage our exposure associated with anticipated cash flows and net asset and liability positions denominated in foreign currencies.
21510_15_ITEM7A_P3_S5	Gains and losses on the forward contracts are mitigated by gains and losses on the underlying instruments.
21510_15_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
21510_15_ITEM7A_P4_S1	On occasion, we enter into currency forward exchange contracts to hedge specific anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions generally expected to occur within the next 12 months.
21510_15_ITEM7A_P4_S2	These cash flow hedges are designated for hedge accounting treatment and gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholder's equity and reclassified into earnings at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized in earnings.
21510_15_ITEM7A_P4_S3	See Note 6 "Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities".
21510_15_ITEM7A_P5_S0	We do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments.
21510_15_ITEM7A_P5_S1	There can be no assurance that these strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately.
21510_15_ITEM7A_P5_S2	While we model currency valuations and fluctuations, these may not ultimately be accurate.
21510_15_ITEM7A_P5_S3	If a financial counterparty to any of our hedging arrangements experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge, we may experience material financial losses.
21510_15_ITEM7A_P6_S0	In the current economic environment, the risk of failure of a financial party remains high.
21510_15_ITEM7A_P7_S0	At October 3, 2015 , approximately $271.3 million of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were held outside the U.S. in certain of our foreign operations, $90.0 million of which was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
21510_15_ITEM7A_P7_S1	A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency rates on our forward contracts would not have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
21510_15_ITEM7A_P8_S0	The following table provides information about our foreign exchange forward contracts at October 3, 2015 .
21510_15_ITEM7A_P8_S1	The table presents the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates, the value of the contracts in U.S. dollars at the contract exchange rate as of the contract maturity date and fair value.
21510_15_ITEM7A_P8_S2	The U.S. fair value represents the fair value of the contracts valued at October 3, 2015 rates.
21510_15_ITEM7A_P9_S0	Forward contracts to sell (buy) foreign currencies (in thousands, except contract rates):
21510_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by this annual report ("Evaluation Date").
21510_15_ITEM9A_P0_S1	The controls evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.
21510_15_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
21510_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the Company.
21510_15_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 3, 2015 , utilizing the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).
21510_15_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on the assessment by management, we determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 3, 2015 .
21510_15_ITEM9A_P1_S3	The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 3, 2015 has been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears below.
21510_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Inherent Limitations Over Internal Controls Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
21510_15_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
21510_15_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
21510_15_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
21510_15_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
21510_15_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud.
21510_15_ITEM9A_P4_S0	A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
21510_15_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
21510_15_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
21510_15_ITEM9A_P4_S3	Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
21510_15_ITEM9A_P4_S4	There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended October 3, 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
21510_15_ITEM9A_P5_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Coherent, Inc.: We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Coherent, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") as of October 3, 2015 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
21510_15_ITEM9A_P5_S1	The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
21510_15_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
21510_15_ITEM9A_P5_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
21510_15_ITEM9A_P5_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
21510_15_ITEM9A_P5_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
21510_15_ITEM9A_P5_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
21510_15_ITEM9A_P6_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
21510_15_ITEM9A_P6_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
21510_15_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
21510_15_ITEM9A_P6_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
21510_15_ITEM9A_P6_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 3, 2015 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
21510_15_ITEM9A_P6_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended October 3, 2015 , of the Company and our report dated December 1, 2015 , expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

21510_15_ITEM15_P15_S0	DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Founded in 1966, Coherent, Inc. provides photonics-based solutions in a broad range of commercial and scientific research applications.
21510_15_ITEM15_P16_S0	Coherent designs, manufactures, services and markets lasers, laser tools and related accessories for a diverse group of customers.
21510_15_ITEM15_P16_S1	Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, the Company has worldwide operations including research and development, manufacturing, sales, service and support capabilities.
21510_15_ITEM15_P17_S0	Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30.
21510_15_ITEM15_P17_S1	Fiscal years 2015 , 2014 and 2013 ended on October 3, 2015 , September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013 , respectively, and are referred to in these financial statements as fiscal 2015 , fiscal 2014 , and fiscal 2013 for convenience.
21510_15_ITEM15_P17_S2	Fiscal year 2015 includes 53 weeks and fiscal years 2014 and 2013 include 52 weeks.
21510_15_ITEM15_P17_S3	The fiscal years of the majority of our international subsidiaries end on September 30.
21510_15_ITEM15_P17_S4	Accordingly, the financial statements of these subsidiaries as of that date and for the years then ended have been used for our consolidated financial statements.
21510_15_ITEM15_P17_S5	Management believes that the impact of the use of different year-ends is immaterial to our consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.
21510_15_ITEM15_P18_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
21510_15_ITEM15_P18_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
21510_15_ITEM15_P19_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Coherent, Inc. and its majority-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company", "we", "our", or "Coherent").
21510_15_ITEM15_P19_S1	Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
21510_15_ITEM15_P20_S0	The carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments including accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
21510_15_ITEM15_P21_S0	Short-term investments are comprised of available-for-sale securities, which are carried at fair value.
21510_15_ITEM15_P21_S1	Other non-current assets include trading securities and life insurance contracts related to our deferred compensation plans; trading securities are carried at fair value and life insurance contracts are carried at cash surrender values, which due to their ability to be converted to cash at that amount, approximate their fair values.
21510_15_ITEM15_P22_S0	Foreign exchange contracts are stated at fair value based on prevailing financial market information.
21510_15_ITEM15_P23_S0	Cash Equivalents All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.
21510_15_ITEM15_P23_S1	At fiscal 2015 year-end, cash and cash equivalents included cash and money market funds.
21510_15_ITEM15_P24_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that may potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable.
21510_15_ITEM15_P24_S1	At fiscal 2015 year-end, the majority of our short-term investments are in US Treasury and federal agency obligations.
21510_15_ITEM15_P24_S2	Cash equivalents and short-term investments are maintained with several financial institutions and may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such balances.
21510_15_ITEM15_P24_S3	At October 3, 2015 , we held cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments outside the U.S. in certain of our foreign operations totaling approximately $271.3 million , $90.0 million of which was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.

21510_15_ITEM15_P25_S1	We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition and limit the amount of credit extended when deemed necessary but generally require no collateral.
21510_15_ITEM15_P25_S2	In certain instances, we may require customers to issue a letter of credit.
21510_15_ITEM15_P25_S3	We maintain reserves for potential credit losses.
21510_15_ITEM15_P25_S4	Our products are broadly distributed and there was one customer who accounted for 21.4% and 15.2% of accounts receivable at fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 year-end.

21510_15_ITEM15_P27_S0	Derivative Financial Instruments Our primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate risk.
21510_15_ITEM15_P27_S1	Principal currencies hedged include the Euro, South Korean Won, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Chinese Renminbi, Malaysian Ringgit and Singapore dollar.
21510_15_ITEM15_P28_S0	Our derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value, on a gross basis, and are included in other current assets and other current liabilities.
21510_15_ITEM15_P28_S1	Our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments are based on whether they meet the criteria for designation as a cash flow hedge.
21510_15_ITEM15_P28_S2	Changes in the fair value of these cash flow hedges that are highly effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same line item on the consolidated statements of operations as the impact of the hedged transaction during the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
21510_15_ITEM15_P29_S0	The ineffective portion of cash flow hedges are recognized immediately in other income and expenses.
21510_15_ITEM15_P30_S0	Derivatives that we designate as cash flow hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the same section as the underlying item, primarily within cash flows from operating activities.
21510_15_ITEM15_P30_S1	The changes in fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges are recognized immediately in other income and expenses.
21510_15_ITEM15_P30_S2	We formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
21510_15_ITEM15_P31_S0	This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as cash-flow hedges to specific forecasted transactions.
21510_15_ITEM15_P31_S1	We also assess, both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items.
21510_15_ITEM15_P32_S0	Accounts Receivable Allowances Accounts receivable allowances reflect our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our accounts receivable balances.
21510_15_ITEM15_P32_S1	We regularly review allowances by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality, the age of the accounts receivable balances and current economic conditions that may affect a customer's ability to pay.
21510_15_ITEM15_P33_S0	Activity in accounts receivable allowance is as follows (in thousands):

21510_15_ITEM15_P37_S0	The fair value (the present value of estimated cash flows) of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.
21510_15_ITEM15_P37_S1	The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset.
21510_15_ITEM15_P37_S2	All of our existing asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return the property to its original condition upon lease termination at various sites and costs to clean up and dispose of certain fixed assets at our Sunnyvale, California site.
21510_15_ITEM15_P37_S3	We estimated that as of fiscal 2015 year-end, gross expected future cash flows of $3.0 million would be required to fulfill these obligations.
21510_15_ITEM15_P37_S4	The following table reconciles changes in our asset retirement liability for fiscal 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):
21510_15_ITEM15_P38_S0	At October 3, 2015 and September 27, 2014 , the asset retirement liability is included in Other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
21510_15_ITEM15_P39_S0	Long-lived Assets We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, whenever events or changes in business circumstances or our planned use of long-lived assets indicate that their carrying amounts may not be fully recoverable or that their useful lives are no longer appropriate.
21510_15_ITEM15_P39_S1	Reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying values of long-lived assets are impaired based on a comparison to the undiscounted expected future net cash flows.
21510_15_ITEM15_P39_S2	If the comparison indicates that impairment exists, long-lived assets that are classified as held and used are written down to their respective fair values.
21510_15_ITEM15_P40_S0	When long-lived assets are classified as held for sale, they are written down to their respective fair values less costs to sell.
21510_15_ITEM15_P40_S1	Significant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that is used in the preparation of expected undiscounted cash flows.
21510_15_ITEM15_P40_S2	For fiscal years 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , there were no significant asset impairments recorded other than the impairment of our investment in SiOnyx (See Note 8.
21510_15_ITEM15_P41_S0	Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and written down when impaired (see Note 7.

21510_15_ITEM15_P43_S0	reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
21510_15_ITEM15_P43_S1	Moreover, an entity can bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the impairment test, and then resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period.
21510_15_ITEM15_P43_S2	In both our fiscal 2015 and 2014 annual testing, we performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill for our SLS reporting unit using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and noted no impairment.
21510_15_ITEM15_P43_S3	For the CLC reporting unit, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test.
21510_15_ITEM15_P43_S4	Accordingly, we performed our Step 1 test using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and noted no impairment in both fiscal 2015 and 2014.
21510_15_ITEM15_P44_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets, including acquired existing technology, customer lists and trade name are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, currently 1 year to 15 years (See Note 7.
21510_15_ITEM15_P45_S0	We provide warranties on the majority of our product sales and reserves for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale.
21510_15_ITEM15_P45_S1	The determination of such reserves requires us to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty.
21510_15_ITEM15_P45_S2	We currently establish warranty reserves based on historical warranty costs for each product line.
21510_15_ITEM15_P45_S3	The weighted average warranty period covered is approximately 15 months .
21510_15_ITEM15_P45_S4	If actual return rates and/or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates, adjustments to cost of sales may be required in future periods.
21510_15_ITEM15_P46_S0	Components of the reserve for warranty costs during fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 were as follows (in thousands):
21510_15_ITEM15_P47_S0	Loss contingencies We are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business.
21510_15_ITEM15_P47_S1	We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset, or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies.
21510_15_ITEM15_P47_S2	An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.
21510_15_ITEM15_P47_S3	If we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined, then we disclose the range of the possible loss.
21510_15_ITEM15_P47_S4	We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted or a range of possible loss should be disclosed.
21510_15_ITEM15_P48_S0	When a sales arrangement contains multiple elements, such as products and/or services, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy.
21510_15_ITEM15_P48_S1	Using the selling price hierarchy, we determine the selling price of each deliverable using vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ), if it exists, and otherwise third-party evidence ( TPE ).
21510_15_ITEM15_P48_S2	If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exists, we use estimated selling price ( ESP ).
21510_15_ITEM15_P48_S3	We generally expect that we will not be able to establish TPE due to the nature of the markets in which we compete, and, as such, we typically will determine selling price using VSOE or if not available, ESP.
21510_15_ITEM15_P49_S0	Our basis for establishing VSOE of a deliverable's selling price consists of standalone sales transactions when the same or similar product or service is sold separately.
21510_15_ITEM15_P50_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2.
21510_15_ITEM15_P51_S0	In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling price for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow price range, as defined by us.
21510_15_ITEM15_P51_S1	We also consider the geographies in which the products or services are sold, major product and service groups, and other environmental variables in determining VSOE.
21510_15_ITEM15_P51_S2	Absent the existence of VSOE and TPE, our determination of a deliverable's ESP involves evaluating several factors based on the specific facts and circumstances of these arrangements, which include pricing strategy and policies driven by geographies, market conditions, competitive landscape, correlation between proportionate selling price and list price established by management having the relevant authority, and other environmental variables in which the deliverable is sold.
21510_15_ITEM15_P52_S0	For multiple element arrangements which include extended maintenance contracts, we allocate and defer the amount of consideration equal to the separately stated price and recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
21510_15_ITEM15_P52_S1	We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered or the service has been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured.
21510_15_ITEM15_P52_S2	Revenue from product sales is recorded when all of the foregoing conditions are met and risk of loss and title passes to the customer.
21510_15_ITEM15_P52_S3	Sales to customers are generally not subject to any price protection or return rights.
21510_15_ITEM15_P53_S0	The majority of our sales are made to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), distributors, representatives and end-users in the non-scientific market.
21510_15_ITEM15_P53_S1	Sales made to these customers do not require installation of the products by us and are not subject to other post-delivery obligations, except in occasional instances where we have agreed to perform installation or provide training.
21510_15_ITEM15_P53_S2	In those instances, we defer revenue related to installation services or training until these services have been rendered.
21510_15_ITEM15_P53_S3	We allocate revenue from multiple element arrangements to the various elements based upon relative fair values.
21510_15_ITEM15_P53_S4	Our sales to distributors, representatives and end-user customers typically do not have customer acceptance provisions and only certain of our sales to OEM customers and integrators have customer acceptance provisions.
21510_15_ITEM15_P53_S5	Customer acceptance is generally limited to performance under our published product specifications.
21510_15_ITEM15_P53_S6	For the few product sales that have customer acceptance provisions because of higher than published specifications, (1) the products are tested and accepted by the customer at our site or the customer accepts the results of our testing program prior to shipment to the customer, or (2) the revenue is deferred until customer acceptance occurs.
21510_15_ITEM15_P54_S0	Sales to end-users in the scientific market typically require installation and, thus, involve post-delivery obligations; however, our post-delivery installation obligations are not essential to the functionality of our products.
21510_15_ITEM15_P54_S1	We defer revenue related to installation services until completion of these services.
21510_15_ITEM15_P55_S0	For most products, training is not provided; therefore, no post-delivery training obligation exists.
21510_15_ITEM15_P55_S1	However, when training is provided to our customers, it is typically priced separately and is recognized as revenue as these services are provided.
21510_15_ITEM15_P56_S0	We record taxes collected on revenue-producing activities on a net basis.
21510_15_ITEM15_P56_S1	Research and Development Research and development expenses include salaries, contractor and consultant fees, supplies and materials, as well as costs related to other overhead such as depreciation, facilities, utilities and other departmental expenses.
21510_15_ITEM15_P56_S2	The costs we incur with respect to internally developed technology and engineering services are included in research and development expenses as incurred as they do not directly relate to any particular licensee, license agreement or license fee.
21510_15_ITEM15_P56_S3	We treat third party and government funding of our research and development activity, where we are the primary beneficiary of such work conducted, as a reduction of research and development cost.
21510_15_ITEM15_P56_S4	Research and development reimbursements of $2.5 million , $7.2 million and $1.7 million were offset against research and development costs in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
21510_15_ITEM15_P57_S0	The functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are generally their respective local currencies.
21510_15_ITEM15_P57_S1	Accordingly, gains and losses from the translation of the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income ("OCI").
21510_15_ITEM15_P57_S2	Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in earnings.

21510_15_ITEM15_P59_S0	Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources.
21510_15_ITEM15_P59_S1	Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (net of tax) at fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 year-ends are substantially comprised of accumulated translation adjustments of $(10.4) million and $35.3 million , respectively.
21510_15_ITEM15_P60_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period, excluding unvested restricted stock.
21510_15_ITEM15_P60_S1	Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period increased by the effect of dilutive employee stock awards, including stock options, restricted stock awards and stock purchase contracts, using the treasury stock method.
21510_15_ITEM15_P60_S2	The following table presents information necessary to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share (in thousands, except per share data):
21510_15_ITEM15_P61_S0	There were no potentially dilutive securities excluded from the dilutive share calculation for fiscal 2015 .
21510_15_ITEM15_P61_S1	A total of 47,242 and 883 potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the dilutive share calculation for fiscal 2014 and 2013 , respectively, as their effect was anti-dilutive.
21510_15_ITEM15_P62_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation using the fair value of the awards granted.
21510_15_ITEM15_P62_S1	We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes Merton model.
21510_15_ITEM15_P62_S2	We value restricted stock units using the intrinsic value method, which is based on the fair market value price on the grant date.
21510_15_ITEM15_P62_S3	We use a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the fair value of performance restricted stock units.
21510_15_ITEM15_P62_S4	We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option and restricted stock unit forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those options and awards that are expected to vest.
21510_15_ITEM15_P62_S5	We amortize the fair value of stock options and awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods.
21510_15_ITEM15_P62_S6	See Note 12 "Employee Stock Award, Option and Benefit Plans" for a description of our stock-based employee compensation plans and the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of stock-based employee compensation.
21510_15_ITEM15_P63_S0	We record costs related to shipping and handling of revenue in Cost of Sales for all periods presented.
21510_15_ITEM15_P63_S1	Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are included in Net Sales.
21510_15_ITEM15_P63_S2	Custom duties billed to customers are recorded in Cost of Sales.
21510_15_ITEM15_P63_S3	Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were $2.1 million , $2.9 million and $3.4 million in fiscal 2015 , fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 , respectively.
21510_15_ITEM15_P64_S0	Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income tax provision (benefit) in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
21510_15_ITEM15_P64_S1	This process involves us estimating our current income tax provision (benefit) together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
21510_15_ITEM15_P64_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets.
21510_15_ITEM15_P65_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2.
21510_15_ITEM15_P66_S0	We account for uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740-10 Income Taxes , which creates a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.
21510_15_ITEM15_P66_S1	This standard provides a two-step approach for evaluating tax positions.
21510_15_ITEM15_P66_S2	The first step, recognition, occurs when a company concludes (based solely on the technical aspects of the matter) that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority.
21510_15_ITEM15_P66_S3	The second step, measurement, is only considered after step one has been satisfied and measures any tax benefit at the largest amount that is deemed more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the uncertainty.
21510_15_ITEM15_P66_S4	These determinations involve significant judgment by management.
21510_15_ITEM15_P66_S5	Tax positions that fail to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first subsequent interim period that they meet the more likely than not standard or when they are resolved through negotiation or litigation with factual interpretation, judgment and certainty.
21510_15_ITEM15_P67_S0	Tax laws and regulations themselves are complex and are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, evolution of regulations and court filings.
21510_15_ITEM15_P67_S1	Therefore, the actual liability for U.S. or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially to reverse previously recorded tax liabilities.
21510_15_ITEM15_P68_S0	We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized.
21510_15_ITEM15_P68_S1	While we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made.
21510_15_ITEM15_P68_S2	Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.
21510_15_ITEM15_P69_S0	Federal and state income taxes have not been provided for on a portion of the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested.
21510_15_ITEM15_P69_S1	The total amount of unremitted earnings (including accumulated translation adjustments) of foreign subsidiaries for which we have not yet recorded federal and state income taxes was approximately $471.9 million and $429.4 million at fiscal 2015 and 2014 year-end, respectively.
21510_15_ITEM15_P69_S2	The amount of federal and state income taxes that would be payable upon repatriation of such earnings is not practicably determinable.
21510_15_ITEM15_P69_S3	We have not, nor do we anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the United States to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business.
21510_15_ITEM15_P70_S0	Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2013, the FASB issued amended guidance that resolves the diversity in practice for the presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists.
21510_15_ITEM15_P70_S1	This new accounting guidance requires the netting of unrecognized tax benefits ("UTBs") against a deferred tax asset for a loss or other carryforward that would apply in settlement of the uncertain tax positions.
21510_15_ITEM15_P70_S2	Under the new standard, UTBs will be netted against all available same-jurisdiction losses or other tax carryforwards that would be utilized, rather than only against carryforwards that are created by the UTBs.
21510_15_ITEM15_P70_S3	The new standard requires prospective adoption but allows retrospective adoption for all periods presented.
21510_15_ITEM15_P70_S4	In the first quarter of fiscal year 2015, we adopted the FASB s amended guidance prospectively in accordance with the standard.
21510_15_ITEM15_P70_S5	As a result of this adoption, both long-term income taxes payable and noncurrent deferred tax assets decreased by $7.9 million on our consolidated balance sheet.
21510_15_ITEM15_P71_S0	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In November, the FASB issued amended guidance that clarifies that in a classified statement of financial position, an entity shall classify deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent amounts.
21510_15_ITEM15_P71_S1	The new guidance supersedes ASC 740-10-45-5 which required the valuation allowance for a particular tax jurisdiction be allocated between current and noncurrent deferred tax assets for that tax jurisdiction on a pro rata basis.
21510_15_ITEM15_P71_S2	The new standard will become effective for our fiscal year beginning October 2, 2017.
21510_15_ITEM15_P71_S3	We are currently assessing the impact of this amended guidance and the timing of adoption.
21510_15_ITEM15_P72_S0	In September 2015, the FASB issued amended guidance that simplifies the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination.
21510_15_ITEM15_P72_S1	Under previous guidance, the acquirer retrospectively adjusted the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill, and would have to revise comparative information for prior periods presented in financial statements as needed.
21510_15_ITEM15_P73_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2.
21510_15_ITEM15_P74_S0	had been recognized as of the acquisition date.
21510_15_ITEM15_P74_S1	The new standard will become effective for our fiscal year beginning October 2, 2017.
21510_15_ITEM15_P74_S2	We are currently assessing the impact of this amended guidance and the timing of adoption.
21510_15_ITEM15_P75_S0	In May 2014, the FASB amended the Accounting Standards Codification and created a new Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
21510_15_ITEM15_P75_S1	The new guidance establishes a single comprehensive contract-based model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers.
21510_15_ITEM15_P75_S2	The new model significantly changes existing GAAP, requires substantial judgment in its application, and will generally require companies to make more disclosures about revenue.
21510_15_ITEM15_P76_S0	The core principle of the amendment is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
21510_15_ITEM15_P76_S1	In applying the new guidance, an entity will (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the contract s performance obligations; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
21510_15_ITEM15_P77_S0	The new standard provides for two alternative implementation methods.
21510_15_ITEM15_P77_S1	The first is to apply the new standard retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented.
21510_15_ITEM15_P77_S2	This method does allow the use of certain practical expedients.
21510_15_ITEM15_P77_S3	The second method is to apply the new standard retrospectively in the year of initial adoption and record a cumulative effect adjustment for the impact of adjusting contracts open at the date of adoption.
21510_15_ITEM15_P77_S4	Under this transition method, we would apply this guidance retrospectively only to contracts that are not completed contracts at the date of initial application.
21510_15_ITEM15_P77_S5	We would then recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings.
21510_15_ITEM15_P77_S6	This method also requires us to disclose comparative information for the year of adoption.
21510_15_ITEM15_P77_S7	In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date.
21510_15_ITEM15_P77_S8	The new standard will become effective for our fiscal year beginning September 30, 2018.
21510_15_ITEM15_P77_S9	We are currently evaluating the new guidance and have not determined the impact this standard may have on our financial statements nor have we decided upon the method of adoption.
21510_15_ITEM15_P78_S0	BUSINESS COMBINATIONS Fiscal 2015 Acquisitions Raydiance, Inc.
21510_15_ITEM15_P78_S1	On July 24, 2015, we acquired certain assets of Raydiance, Inc. ("Raydiance") for approximately $5.0 million , excluding transaction costs.
21510_15_ITEM15_P79_S0	Raydiance manufactured complete tools and lasers for ultrafast processing systems and subsystems in the precision micromachining processing market.
21510_15_ITEM15_P79_S1	The Raydiance assets have been included in our Specialty Lasers and Systems segment.
21510_15_ITEM15_P79_S2	Our preliminary allocation of the purchase price is as follows (in thousands):
21510_15_ITEM15_P80_S0	Results of operations for the business have been included in our consolidated financial statements subsequent to the date of acquisition and pro forma results of operations in accordance with authoritative guidance for prior periods have not been presented because the effect of the acquisition was not material to our prior period consolidated financial results.
21510_15_ITEM15_P81_S0	The identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over their respective useful lives o f three to five years.
21510_15_ITEM15_P81_S1	None of the goodwill from this purchase is deductible for tax purposes.
21510_15_ITEM15_P81_S2	We expensed $0.1 million of acquisition-related costs as selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations for our fiscal year 2015.

21510_15_ITEM15_P83_S0	On July 27, 2015, we acquired the assets and certain liabilities of the Tinsley Optics ("Tinsley") business from L-3 Communications Corporation for approximately $4.3 million , excluding transaction costs.
21510_15_ITEM15_P84_S0	Tinsley is a specialized manufacturer of high precision optical components and subsystems sold primarily in the aerospace and defense industry.
21510_15_ITEM15_P84_S1	Tinsley manufactures the large form factor optics for our excimer laser annealing systems.
21510_15_ITEM15_P84_S2	Tinsley has been included in our Specialty Lasers and Systems segment.
21510_15_ITEM15_P84_S3	Our preliminary allocation of the purchase price is as follows (in thousands):

21510_15_ITEM15_P99_S2	The market inputs used to value these instruments generally consist of market yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.
21510_15_ITEM15_P99_S3	Pricing sources include industry standard data providers, security master files from large financial institutions, and other third party sources which are input into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine a daily market value.
21510_15_ITEM15_P99_S4	This creates a consensus price or a weighted average price for each security.
21510_15_ITEM15_P99_S5	(3) The principal market in which we execute our foreign currency contracts is the institutional market in an over-the-counter environment with a relatively high level of price transparency.

21510_15_ITEM15_P104_S0	SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS We consider all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.
21510_15_ITEM15_P104_S1	Investments classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of related income taxes, recorded as a separate component of OCI in stockholders' equity until realized.

21510_15_ITEM15_P109_S0	DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES We maintain operations in various countries outside of the United States and have foreign subsidiaries that manufacture and sell our products in various global markets.
21510_15_ITEM15_P109_S1	The majority of our sales are transacted in U.S. dollars.
21510_15_ITEM15_P109_S2	However, we do generate revenues in other currencies, primarily the Euro, Japanese Yen, South Korean Won and Chinese Renminbi (RMB).
21510_15_ITEM15_P109_S3	As a result, our earnings, cash flows and cash balances are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
21510_15_ITEM15_P109_S4	We attempt to limit these exposures through financial market instruments.
21510_15_ITEM15_P109_S5	We utilize derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts with maturities of two months or less, to manage our exposure associated with anticipated cash flows and net asset and liability positions denominated in foreign currencies.
21510_15_ITEM15_P109_S6	Gains and losses on the forward contracts are mitigated by gains and losses on the underlying instruments.
21510_15_ITEM15_P110_S0	We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
21510_15_ITEM15_P111_S0	The credit risk amounts represent the Company s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency rates at each respective date.

21510_15_ITEM15_P115_S0	Designated Derivatives Cash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of the hedge when we enter into contracts for specific future transactions.
21510_15_ITEM15_P115_S1	Cash flow hedges are evaluated for effectiveness quarterly.
21510_15_ITEM15_P116_S0	The effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is reported as a component of OCI in stockholder's equity and is reclassified into earnings when the underlying transaction affects earnings.
21510_15_ITEM15_P116_S1	The majority of the after-tax net income or loss related to derivative instruments included in OCI at October 3, 2015 is expected to be reclassified into earnings within 12 months.
21510_15_ITEM15_P117_S0	Changes in the fair value of currency forward contracts due to changes in time value are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness and recognized in other income (expense) as incurred.
21510_15_ITEM15_P118_S0	We classify the cash flows from the foreign exchange forward contracts that are accounted for as cash flow hedges in the same section as the underlying item, primarily within cash flows from operating activities since we do not designate our cash flow hedges as investing or financing activities.
21510_15_ITEM15_P118_S1	The outstanding notional contract and fair value asset (liability) amounts of designated cash flow hedge contracts, with maximum maturity of thirteen months, are as follows (in thousands):

21510_15_ITEM15_P121_S0	The fair value of our derivative instruments is included in prepaid expenses and other assets and in other current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets (See Note 4); such amounts were not material as of October 3, 2015 and September 27, 2014 .
21510_15_ITEM15_P121_S1	The locations and amounts of designated and non-designated derivative instruments gains and losses in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended October 3, 2015 and September 27, 2014 were as follows (in thousands):
21510_15_ITEM15_P122_S0	During the fiscal year ended October 3, 2015 we recognized a loss of $0.1 million in other income (expense) as ineffectiveness related to a portion of an anticipated hedged transaction that failed to occur within the original hedge period plus two months.
21510_15_ITEM15_P122_S1	The remainder of the hedged transaction occurred as expected and effective amounts were recognized in revenue as disclosed in the above table.
21510_15_ITEM15_P122_S2	The amounts that will be reclassified from OCI to earnings will generally be offset by the recognition of the hedged transactions (e.g., anticipated cost of sales) in earnings, thereby achieving the realization of prices contemplated by the underlying risk management strategies and will vary from the expected amounts presented above as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates.
21510_15_ITEM15_P123_S0	To mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions, we enter into master netting arrangements that allow each counterparty in the arrangements to net settle amounts of multiple and separate derivative transactions under certain conditions.
21510_15_ITEM15_P123_S1	We present the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities within the our consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis even when derivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation.
21510_15_ITEM15_P123_S2	Our derivative contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features and do not require collateral or other security to be furnished by us or the counterparties.

21510_15_ITEM15_P127_S0	GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have occurred, and we write down these assets when impaired.
21510_15_ITEM15_P127_S1	We perform our annual impairment tests during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter, with any resulting impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.
21510_15_ITEM15_P128_S0	Coherent has two reporting units: Specialty Laser Systems and Commercial Lasers and Components.
21510_15_ITEM15_P129_S0	In our fiscal 2015 annual testing, we performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill for our SLS reporting unit during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount.
21510_15_ITEM15_P129_S1	In assessing the qualitative factors, we considered the impact of these key factors: macroeconomic conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency, market and industry conditions, our operating and competitive environment, regulatory and political developments, the overall financial performance of the reporting unit including cost factors and budgeted-to-actual revenue results.
21510_15_ITEM15_P129_S2	We also considered our market capitalization, stock price performance and the significant excess between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the SLS reporting unit.
21510_15_ITEM15_P129_S3	Based on our assessment, goodwill in the SLS reporting unit was not impaired as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
21510_15_ITEM15_P129_S4	As such, it was not necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test at that time.

21510_15_ITEM15_P131_S0	We performed our Step 1 test using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and noted no impairment.
21510_15_ITEM15_P131_S1	We determined the fair value of the CLC reporting unit for the Step 1 test using a 50-50% weighting of the Income (discounted cash flow) approach and Market (market comparable) approach.
21510_15_ITEM15_P131_S2	Management completed and reviewed the results of the Step 1 analysis and concluded that a Step 2 analysis was not required as the estimated fair value of the CLC reporting unit was significantly in excess of its carrying value.
21510_15_ITEM15_P131_S3	Between the completion of that testing and the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we noted no indications of impairment or triggering events with either reporting unit to cause us to review goodwill for potential impairment.
21510_15_ITEM15_P132_S0	The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment for fiscal 2015 and 2014 are as follows (in thousands):
21510_15_ITEM15_P133_S0	(1) Gross amount of goodwill for our CLC segment was $25.7 million at both October 3, 2015 and September 27, 2014 .

21510_15_ITEM15_P134_S0	We evaluate long-lived assets and amortizable intangible assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances or our planned use of assets indicate that their carrying amounts may not be fully recoverable or that their useful lives are no longer appropriate.
21510_15_ITEM15_P134_S1	Reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying values of assets are impaired based on comparison to the undiscounted expected future cash flows identifiable to such long-lived and amortizable intangible assets.
21510_15_ITEM15_P134_S2	If the comparison indicates that impairment exists, the impaired asset is written down to its fair value.
21510_15_ITEM15_P134_S3	During fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , we did not have any impairment of intangible assets as a result of the impairment analysis.

21510_15_ITEM15_P141_S2	During the third quarter of fiscal 2015 we determined that our investment became other-than temporarily impaired.
21510_15_ITEM15_P141_S3	As a result, during the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded a non-cash charge of $2.0 million in our results of operations to impair this investment.
21510_15_ITEM15_P141_S4	In determining the fair value of the cost method investment, we considered many factors including but not limited to operating performance of the investee, the amount of cash that the investee has on-hand, the ability to obtain additional financing and the overall market conditions in which the investee operates.

21510_15_ITEM15_P166_S1	Grants to employees generally expire four years from the original grant date.
21510_15_ITEM15_P166_S2	Since adoption of the 2011 Plan, no stock options have been granted to employees.
21510_15_ITEM15_P166_S3	Director options were previously automatically granted to our non-employee directors.
21510_15_ITEM15_P166_S4	New directors now initially receive an award of restricted stock units of 3,500 shares which vest over a two year period.
21510_15_ITEM15_P166_S5	The annual grant for non-employee directors is 3,500 shares of restricted stock units that vest on February 15 of the calendar year following the grant.
21510_15_ITEM15_P166_S6	Restricted stock awards and restricted stock units are typically subject to vesting restrictions either time-based or market-based conditions for vesting.
21510_15_ITEM15_P166_S7	Until restricted stock vests, shares (including those issuable upon vesting of the applicable restricted stock unit) are subject to forfeiture if employment or service to the Company terminates prior to the release of restrictions and cannot be transferred.
21510_15_ITEM15_P167_S0	The service based restricted stock awards generally vest within three years from the date of grant.
21510_15_ITEM15_P168_S0	The service based restricted stock unit awards are generally subject to annual vesting over three years from the date of grant.
21510_15_ITEM15_P169_S0	The performance restricted stock unit award grants are generally either subject to annual vesting over three years from the date of grant or subject to a single vest measurement three years from the date of grant, depending upon achievement of performance measurements based on the performance of the Company's total shareholder returns (as defined in the plan) compared with the performance of the Russell 2000 Index.
21510_15_ITEM15_P170_S0	We recognize compensation expense for all share-based payment awards based on the fair value of such awards.
21510_15_ITEM15_P170_S1	The expense is recognized on a straight-line basis per tranche over the respective requisite service period of the awards.
21510_15_ITEM15_P171_S0	Determining Fair Value Valuation and amortization method We estimate the fair value of employee stock purchase shares using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing formula.
21510_15_ITEM15_P171_S1	This fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the purchase period.
21510_15_ITEM15_P172_S0	The expected term represents the period of our employee stock purchase plan.
21510_15_ITEM15_P172_S1	Our process for computing expected volatility considers both historical volatility and market-based implied volatility; however our estimate of expected forfeitures is based on historical employee data and could differ from actual forfeitures.
21510_15_ITEM15_P173_S0	The risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation method is based on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term.

21510_15_ITEM15_P177_S1	The performance stock unit agreements provide for the award of performance stock units with each unit representing the right to receive one share of our common stock to be issued after the applicable award vesting period.
21510_15_ITEM15_P177_S2	The final number of units awarded, if any, for these performance grants will be determined as of the vesting dates, based upon our total shareholder return over the performance period compared to the Russell 2000 Index and could range from no units to a maximum of twice the initial award units.
21510_15_ITEM15_P177_S3	The weighted average fair value for these performance units was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model incorporating the following weighted average assumptions:
21510_15_ITEM15_P178_S0	We recognize the estimated cost of these awards, as determined under the simulation model, over the related service period, with no adjustment in future periods based upon the actual shareholder return over the performance period.
21510_15_ITEM15_P178_S1	The following table shows total stock-based compensation expense and related tax benefits included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):
21510_15_ITEM15_P179_S0	Total stock-based compensation cost capitalized as part of inventory during fiscal 2015 was $2.5 million ; $2.5 million was amortized into income during fiscal 2015 , which includes amounts capitalized in fiscal 2015 and amounts carried over from fiscal 2014 .

21510_15_ITEM15_P179_S3	At fiscal 2015 year-end, the total compensation cost related to unvested stock-based awards granted to employees under the Company's stock plans but not yet recognized was approximately $19.0 million , net of estimated forfeitures of $0.6 million .
21510_15_ITEM15_P179_S4	This cost will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.4 years and will be adjusted for subsequent changes in estimated forfeitures.
21510_15_ITEM15_P179_S5	At fiscal 2015 year-end, the total compensation cost related to options to purchase common shares under the ESPP but not yet recognized was approximately $0.2 million .
21510_15_ITEM15_P179_S6	This cost will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately one month.
21510_15_ITEM15_P180_S0	The stock option exercise tax benefits reported in the statement of cash flows results from the excess tax benefits arising from tax deductions in excess of the stock-based compensation cost recognized, determined on a grant-by-grant basis.

21510_15_ITEM15_P184_S0	Performance awards and units included at 100% of target goal; under the terms of the awards, the recipient may earn between 0% and 200% of the award.
21510_15_ITEM15_P185_S0	Restricted Stock Units are converted into the right to receive common stock upon vesting; prior to issuance, the Company permits the employee holders to satisfy their tax withholding requirements by net settlement, whereby the Company withholds a portion of the shares to cover the applicable taxes based on the fair market value of the Company's stock at the vesting date.
21510_15_ITEM15_P185_S1	The number of shares withheld to cover tax payments was 91,000 in fiscal 2015 , 118,000 in fiscal 2014 and 95,000 in fiscal 2013 ; tax payments made were $5.3 million , $7.8 million and $4.2 million , respectively.

21510_15_ITEM15_P190_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 14.
21510_15_ITEM15_P191_S0	The effective tax rate on income before income taxes for fiscal 2015 of 23.3% was lower than the statutory rate of 35.0%.
21510_15_ITEM15_P191_S1	This was primarily due to differences related to the benefit of income subject to foreign tax rates that are lower than U.S. tax rates including South Korea and Singapore tax exemptions, the benefit of foreign tax credits and the benefit of federal research and development tax credits including renewal of the federal research and development tax credits for fiscal 2014.
21510_15_ITEM15_P191_S2	These amounts are partially offset by deemed dividend inclusions under the Subpart F tax rules, stock-based compensation not deductible for tax purposes and limitations on the deductibility of compensation under IRC Section 162(m).
21510_15_ITEM15_P192_S0	Coherent Korea received the final approval for a High-Tech tax exemption in 2013 from the South Korean authorities and it is subject to capital contribution limitations.
21510_15_ITEM15_P192_S1	The impact of this tax exemption decreased South Korean income taxes by approximately $2.8 million (or $0.11 per diluted share) in fiscal 2015, $2.4 million (or $0.10 per diluted share) in fiscal 2014 and $2.1 million (or $0.09 per diluted share) in fiscal 2013.
21510_15_ITEM15_P192_S2	The remaining High-Tech tax exemption benefit is minimal and should be fully utilized in fiscal 2016 and Coherent Korea should be subject to South Korea income tax at that time.
21510_15_ITEM15_P192_S3	Coherent Singapore had previously received a Pioneer Status tax exemption from the Singapore authorities effective from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2017, and it may be extended if certain additional requirements are satisfied.
21510_15_ITEM15_P193_S0	The tax holiday is conditional upon our meeting certain revenue, business spending and employment thresholds.
21510_15_ITEM15_P193_S1	Although Coherent Singapore had income in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, these amounts were offset by a loss carryforward from fiscal 2012 and therefore we did not realize a cumulative benefit for the Singapore tax holiday.
21510_15_ITEM15_P193_S2	The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in thousands):

21510_15_ITEM15_P195_S0	In determining our fiscal 2015 and 2014 tax provisions under ASC Subtopic 740, we calculated the deferred tax assets and liabilities for each separate tax entity.
21510_15_ITEM15_P195_S1	We then considered a number of factors including the positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of our deferred tax assets to determine whether a valuation allowance should be recognized with respect to our deferred tax assets.
21510_15_ITEM15_P195_S2	We determined that a valuation allowance was appropriate for a portion of the deferred tax assets of our California and certain state research and development tax credits, foreign tax attributes and foreign net operating losses at fiscal 2015 and 2014 year-ends.
21510_15_ITEM15_P195_S3	During fiscal 2015 , we increased our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by $1.2 million to $15.6 million , primarily due to the reduced ability to utilize California and certain state research and development tax credits.
21510_15_ITEM15_P196_S0	The net deferred tax asset is classified on the consolidated balance sheets as follows (in thousands):
21510_15_ITEM15_P197_S0	We have various tax attribute carryforwards which include the following:

21510_15_ITEM15_P201_S2	No valuation allowance is recorded against the federal gross capital loss and the state gross capital loss carryforwards since we anticipate that it is more likely than not we will be able to utilize the capital loss in the future.

21510_15_ITEM15_P204_S2	In our major foreign jurisdictions and our major state jurisdictions, the years prior to 2006 and 2011, respectively, are closed to examination.
21510_15_ITEM15_P204_S3	Earlier years in our various jurisdictions may remain open for adjustment to the extent that we have tax attribute carryforwards from those years.
21510_15_ITEM15_P204_S4	The various tax authorities may choose to audit tax returns for tax years beyond the statute of limitations period due to significant tax attribute carryforwards from those prior years, making adjustments only to carryforward attributes.
21510_15_ITEM15_P204_S5	We believe that we have provided adequate reserves for any adjustments that may be determined by the tax authorities.
21510_15_ITEM15_P204_S6	A reconciliation of the change in gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, is as follows (in thousands):
21510_15_ITEM15_P205_S0	As of October 3, 2015 , the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits including gross interest and penalties was $24.3 million , of which $16.4 million , if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate.
21510_15_ITEM15_P205_S1	Our total gross unrecognized tax benefit was classified as long-term taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheets.
21510_15_ITEM15_P205_S2	We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes.

21510_15_ITEM15_P207_S0	Management believes that it has adequately provided for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.
21510_15_ITEM15_P208_S0	We regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions.
21510_15_ITEM15_P208_S1	It is reasonably possible that certain federal, foreign and state tax matters may be concluded in the next 12 months.
21510_15_ITEM15_P208_S2	A summary of the fiscal tax years that remain subject to examination, as of October 3, 2015 , for our major tax jurisdictions is:
21510_15_ITEM15_P209_S0	SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION We are organized into two reportable operating segments: Specialty Lasers and Systems ("SLS") and Commercial Lasers and Components ("CLC").
21510_15_ITEM15_P210_S0	This segmentation reflects the go-to-market strategies for various products and markets.
21510_15_ITEM15_P210_S1	While both segments work to deliver cost-effective solutions, SLS develops and manufactures configurable, advanced-performance products largely serving the microelectronics, scientific research and government programs and OEM components and instrumentation markets.
21510_15_ITEM15_P210_S2	The size and complexity of many of our SLS products require service to be performed at the customer site by factory-trained field service engineers.
21510_15_ITEM15_P211_S0	CLC focuses on higher volume products that are offered in set configurations.
21510_15_ITEM15_P211_S1	The product architectures are designed for easy exchange at the point of use such that product service and repairs are based upon advanced replacement and depot (i.e., factory) repair.
21510_15_ITEM15_P212_S0	CLC's primary markets include materials processing, OEM components and instrumentation and microelectronics.
21510_15_ITEM15_P213_S0	We have identified SLS and CLC as operating segments for which discrete financial information is available.
21510_15_ITEM15_P213_S1	Both units have dedicated engineering, manufacturing, product business management and product line management functions.
21510_15_ITEM15_P214_S0	A small portion of our outside revenue is attributable to projects and recently developed products for which a segment has not yet been determined.
21510_15_ITEM15_P215_S0	The associated direct and indirect costs are presented in the category of Corporate and other, along with other corporate costs as described below.
21510_15_ITEM15_P216_S0	Our Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the chief operating decision maker (CODM) as he assesses the performance of the segments and decides how to allocate resources to the segments.
21510_15_ITEM15_P216_S1	Income from operations is the measure of profit and loss that our CODM uses to assess performance and make decisions.
21510_15_ITEM15_P216_S2	As assets are not a measure used to assess the performance of the company by the CODM, asset information is not tracked or compiled by segment and is not available to be reported in our disclosures.
21510_15_ITEM15_P217_S0	Income from operations represents the net sales less the cost of sales and direct operating expenses incurred within the operating segments as well as allocated expenses such as shared sales and manufacturing costs.
21510_15_ITEM15_P217_S1	We do not allocate to our operating segments certain operating expenses which we manage separately at the corporate level.
21510_15_ITEM15_P217_S2	These unallocated costs include stock-based compensation and corporate functions (certain research and development, management, finance, legal and human resources) and are included in the results below under Corporate and other in the reconciliation of operating results.
21510_15_ITEM15_P217_S3	Management does not consider unallocated Corporate and other costs in its measurement of segment performance.

21510_15_ITEM15_P226_S1	See item 15 for a complete index of such exhibits.
21510_15_ITEM15_P227_S0	The Company hereby grants to the Employee an award of Restricted Stock Units ( RSUs ), as set forth in the Notice of Grant, subject to the terms and conditions in this Agreement and in the Company's 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan ).
21510_15_ITEM15_P227_S1	Initially capitalized terms herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Plan or as defined herein, as applicable.
21510_15_ITEM15_P228_S0	Each RSU represents the right to receive a Share on the vesting date.
21510_15_ITEM15_P228_S1	Unless and until the RSUs vest, the Employee will have no right to receive Shares under such RSUs.
21510_15_ITEM15_P228_S2	Prior to actual distribution of Shares pursuant to any vested RSUs, such RSUs will represent an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable (if at all) only from the general assets of the Company.
21510_15_ITEM15_P229_S0	Vesting Schedule; Assumption or Substitution Calculation .
21510_15_ITEM15_P229_S1	The RSUs shall vest as follows:
21510_15_ITEM15_P230_S0	Up to the Maximum Amount will vest and be settled, based upon the extent, if any, to which the performance metric has been achieved.
21510_15_ITEM15_P231_S0	The performance metric is the relative performance of Company stock against the Russell 2000 index over a three-year period, with the target Company stock performance equivalent to the performance of the Russell 2000 index over such period.
21510_15_ITEM15_P231_S1	To determine relative performance, the baseline metrics are the 90 trading day average closing price of the Company and the Russell 2000 Index, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, or such other reliable source as is determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion, with the last of the 90 trading days falling on November 14, 2012.
21510_15_ITEM15_P231_S2	This 90 day average establishes both the Company baseline stock price (the Company Baseline Stock Price ) and the Russell 2000 Index baseline (the Russell 2000 Baseline ) against which future Company stock and Russell 2000 Index performance will be compared.
21510_15_ITEM15_P232_S0	Next, the Company will measure the 90 trading day average closing price of the Company and the Russell 2000 Index, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, or such other reliable source as is determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion, with the last trading day of such 90-trading day period ending on November 13, 2015 (establishing both the Company Closing Price and the Russell 2000 Index Closing Price ).
21510_15_ITEM15_P233_S0	The Company will then measure Company performance by dividing the Company Closing Price by the Company Baseline Stock Price, with the quotient expressed as a percentage of the Company Baseline Stock Price (the Company Percentage Performance ).
21510_15_ITEM15_P233_S1	The Company will then measure Russell 2000 Index Performance over the same period by dividing the Russell 2000 Index Closing Price by the Russell 2000 Index Baseline with the quotient expressed as a percentage of the Russell 2000 Index Baseline (the Russell 2000 Index Percentage Performance ).
21510_15_ITEM15_P234_S0	The Company will then subtract the Russell 2000 Index Percentage Performance from the Company Percentage Performance, then add 100 to the result, with the final result constituting the relative Company performance as a percentage (the Relative Performance Percentage ).
21510_15_ITEM15_P235_S0	If the Relative Performance Percentage is 50% or less, no RSUs shall vest.
21510_15_ITEM15_P235_S1	If the Relative Performance Percentage equals 51%, then 2% of the Target Amount shall vest.
21510_15_ITEM15_P235_S2	If the Relative Performance Percentage equals 70%, then 40% of the Target Amount shall vest.
21510_15_ITEM15_P235_S3	If the Relative Performance Percentage equals 100%, then the Target Amount shall vest.
21510_15_ITEM15_P235_S4	If the Relative Performance Percentage equals 150% or more, then 200% of the Target Amount shall vest (i.e., the Maximum Amount shall vest).
21510_15_ITEM15_P235_S5	Relative Performance Percentages shall result in incremental vesting on a straight-line basis within tiers based on full percentage Relative Performance Percentages as set forth below:
21510_15_ITEM15_P236_S0	The Company Closing Price shall be automatically adjusted to account for any Company stock split or similar change in capitalization effected without receipt of consideration by the Company set forth in Plan Section 19(a) in the same manner as set forth in Plan Section 19(a).
21510_15_ITEM15_P236_S1	In making determinations of the number of Shares that vest hereunder, all Relative Performance Percentage fractional percentages and Share numbers below .5 shall be rounded down to the nearest whole percentage or Share number, respectively and all Relative Performance Percentage fractional percentages and Share numbers of .5 or greater shall be rounded up to the nearest whole percentage or Share number, respectively.
21510_15_ITEM15_P236_S2	All vesting and delivery of Shares hereunder, except pursuant to assumed or substituted awards in a change of control as specified in the following paragraph, shall be subject to the prior written or electronic certification of the Compensation Committee of the Board as to the extent to which the applicable performance milestones have been achieved.
21510_15_ITEM15_P237_S0	In the event the Company is acquired in a merger or asset sale pursuant to which this RSU is assumed or substituted pursuant to Plan Section 19(c) (a Change of Control ), then if the performance period has not been completed as of the date of the Change of Control, the Company Closing Price shall be deemed to be the price per share received by the Company's stockholders in the Change of Control.
21510_15_ITEM15_P237_S1	Relative performance for such uncompleted performance period shall then be measured against the Russell 2000 Index performance from the Russell 2000 Index Baseline through the 90 trading day average closing price of the Russell 2000 Index in the period ending on the date of the Change of Control.
21510_15_ITEM15_P237_S2	The Company's stock performance relative to the Russell 2000 Index shall then be determined consistently with the methodology specified herein for completed performance period.
21510_15_ITEM15_P237_S3	The number of Shares subject to this RSU so determined shall then continue to vest based upon Employee's continuing as a Service Provider to the Company, the acquirer, or their Parents or Subsidiaries through November 13, 2015, subject to accelerated vesting as set forth in the Company's Change of Control Severance Plan (but only for participants in such plan), as amended from time to time.
21510_15_ITEM15_P238_S0	Vesting = 170% of the Target Amount vesting, subject to Employee's continuing as a Service Provider through November 13, 2015 and further subject to accelerated vesting as set forth in the Company's Change of Control Severance Plan (but only for participants in such plan), as amended from time to time.
21510_15_ITEM15_P239_S0	Forfeiture upon Termination as an Employee .
21510_15_ITEM15_P239_S1	Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement or the Notice of Grant, if the Employee terminates service as a Service Provider for any or no reason prior to vesting, the unvested RSUs awarded by this Agreement will thereupon be forfeited at no cost to the Company, subject to accelerated vesting as set forth in the Company's Change of Control Severance Plan (but only for participants in such plan), as amended from time to time.
21510_15_ITEM15_P240_S0	Any RSUs that vest in accordance with paragraph 3 will be distributed to the Employee (or in the event of the Employee's death, to his or her estate) in Shares.
21510_15_ITEM15_P241_S0	Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph 5, no Shares shall be distributed to Employee unless and until the Employee shall have delivered to the Company or its designated Subsidiary the full amount of any federal, state or local income or other taxes which the Company or such Subsidiary may be required by law to withhold with respect to such Shares.
21510_15_ITEM15_P241_S1	The Employee may elect to satisfy any such statutory minimum tax withholding requirement by having the Company withhold Shares otherwise deliverable to the Employee or by delivering to the Company already-owned Shares, subject to the absolute discretion of the Company to disallow satisfaction of such withholding by the delivery or withholding of stock.
21510_15_ITEM15_P242_S0	Neither the Employee nor any person claiming under or through the Employee will have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any Shares deliverable hereunder unless and until certificates representing such Shares will have been issued, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Employee or Employee's broker.

21510_15_ITEM15_P246_S0	d. Employee waives any and all rights to compensation or damages as a result of the termination of employment with the Company for any reason whatsoever insofar as those rights result or may result from:

21510_15_ITEM15_P248_S0	The grant of the RSU, and any future grant of RSUs under the Plan is entirely voluntary, and at the complete discretion of the Company.
21510_15_ITEM15_P249_S0	Neither the grant of the RSU nor any future grant of an RSU by the Company will be deemed to create any obligation to grant any further RSUs, whether or not such a reservation is explicitly stated at the time of such a grant.

21510_15_ITEM15_P271_S2	This 90 day average establishes both the Company baseline stock price (the Company Baseline Stock Price ) and the Russell 2000 Index baseline (the Russell 2000 Baseline ) against which future Company stock and Russell 2000 Index performance will be compared.

21510_16_ITEM1_P0_S0	Business Overview Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30.
21510_16_ITEM1_P0_S1	Fiscal years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 ended on October 1 , October 3 , and September 27 , respectively, and are referred to in this annual report as fiscal 2016 , fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 for convenience.
21510_16_ITEM1_P0_S2	Fiscal years 2016 and 2014 included 52 weeks and fiscal year 2015 included 53 weeks.
21510_16_ITEM1_P1_S0	We are one of the world's leading providers of lasers and laser-based technology in a broad range of scientific, commercial and industrial applications.
21510_16_ITEM1_P1_S1	We design, manufacture, service and market lasers and related accessories for a diverse group of customers.
21510_16_ITEM1_P1_S2	Since inception in 1966, we have grown through internal expansion and through strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies, intellectual property, manufacturing processes and product offerings.
21510_16_ITEM1_P1_S3	We are organized into two operating segments: Specialty Lasers and Systems ("SLS") and Commercial Lasers and Components ("CLC").
21510_16_ITEM1_P1_S4	This segmentation reflects the go-to-market strategies for various products and markets.
21510_16_ITEM1_P1_S5	While both segments deliver cost-effective photonics solutions, SLS develops and manufactures configurable, advanced performance products largely serving the microelectronics, scientific research and government programs and original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") components and instrumentation markets.
21510_16_ITEM1_P1_S6	The size and complexity of many of the SLS products require service to be performed at the customer site by factory-trained field service engineers.
21510_16_ITEM1_P2_S0	CLC focuses on higher volume products that are offered in set configurations.
21510_16_ITEM1_P2_S1	The product architectures are designed for easy exchange at the point of use such that substantially all product service and repairs are based upon advanced replacement and depot (i.e., factory) repair.
21510_16_ITEM1_P3_S0	CLC's primary markets include materials processing, OEM components and instrumentation and microelectronics.
21510_16_ITEM1_P4_S0	Income from operations is the measure of profit and loss that our chief operating decision maker ("CODM") uses to assess performance and make decisions.
21510_16_ITEM1_P4_S1	Income from operations represents the sales less the cost of sales and direct operating expenses incurred within the operating segments as well as allocated expenses such as shared sales and manufacturing costs.
21510_16_ITEM1_P4_S2	We do not allocate to our operating segments certain operating expenses, which we manage separately at the corporate level.
21510_16_ITEM1_P4_S3	These unallocated costs include stock-based compensation and corporate functions (certain advanced research and development, management, finance, legal and human resources) and are included in Corporate and other.
21510_16_ITEM1_P4_S4	Management does not consider unallocated Corporate and other costs in its measurement of segment performance.
21510_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	We were originally incorporated in California on May 26, 1966 and reincorporated in Delaware on October 1, 1990.
21510_16_ITEM1_P5_S1	Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and we are a member of the Standard Poor's SmallCap 600 Index and the Russell 2000 Index.
21510_16_ITEM1_P5_S2	Additional information about Coherent, Inc. (referred to herein as the Company, we, our, or Coherent) is available on our web site at www.coherent.com.

21510_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	Any product, product name, process, or technology described in these materials is the property of Coherent.
21510_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	RECENT EVENTS On November 7, 2016, we completed our previously announced acquisition of Rofin-Sinar Technologies Inc. ("Rofin") pursuant to the Merger Agreement dated March 16, 2016.
21510_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	Rofin is one of the world's leading developers and manufacturers of high-performance industrial laser sources and laser-based solutions and components.
21510_16_ITEM1_P8_S1	As a condition of the acquisition, we are required to divest ourselves of Rofin s low power CO2 laser business based in Hull, United Kingdom, and will report this business separately as a discontinued operation until it is divested.
21510_16_ITEM1_P8_S2	The acquisition was an all-cash transaction at a price of $32.50 per share of Rofin common stock.
21510_16_ITEM1_P8_S3	The aggregate consideration paid by us to the former Rofin stockholders was approximately $904.5 million, excluding related transaction fees and expenses.
21510_16_ITEM1_P8_S4	We also paid $15.3 million due to the cancellation of options held by employees of Rofin.
21510_16_ITEM1_P8_S5	We funded the payment of the aggregate consideration with a combination of our available cash on hand and the proceeds from the Euro Term Loan described below.
21510_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	Laser Systems and Industrial Lasers and Systems.
21510_16_ITEM1_P9_S1	Accordingly, our segment information will be restated retroactively in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
21510_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	On November 7, 2016, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement ) with Barclays Bank PLC, Bank of America, N.A., and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd.
21510_16_ITEM1_P10_S1	The Credit Agreement provided for a 670.0 million Euro senior secured term loan facility and a $100.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility.
21510_16_ITEM1_P10_S2	On November 7, 2016, the Euro Term Loan was drawn in full and its proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of Rofin and pay related fees and expenses.
21510_16_ITEM1_P10_S3	Also, on November 7, 2016, we used 10.0 million Euro of the capacity under the revolving credit facility for the issuance of a letter of credit.
21510_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	A laser emits an intense coherent beam of light with some unique and highly useful properties.
21510_16_ITEM1_P11_S1	Most importantly, a laser is orders of magnitude brighter than any lamp.
21510_16_ITEM1_P11_S2	As a result of its coherence, the beam can be focused to a very small and intense spot, useful for applications requiring very high power densities including cutting and other materials processing procedures.
21510_16_ITEM1_P11_S3	The laser's high spatial resolution is also useful for microscopic imaging and inspection applications.
21510_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	Laser light can be monochromatic all of the beam energy is confined to a narrow wavelength band.
21510_16_ITEM1_P12_S1	Some lasers can be used to create ultrafast output a series of pulses with pulse durations as short as attoseconds (i.e., 10 -18 seconds).
21510_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	There are many types of lasers and one way of classifying them is by the material or medium used to create the lasing action.
21510_16_ITEM1_P13_S1	This can be in the form of a gas, liquid, semiconductor, solid state crystal or fiber.
21510_16_ITEM1_P13_S2	Lasers can also be classified by their output wavelength: ultraviolet, visible, infrared or wavelength tunable.
21510_16_ITEM1_P13_S3	We manufacture all of these laser types.
21510_16_ITEM1_P13_S4	There are also many options in terms of pulsed output versus continuous wave, pulse duration, output power, beam dimensions, etc.
21510_16_ITEM1_P13_S5	In fact, each application has its specific requirements in terms of laser performance.
21510_16_ITEM1_P13_S6	The broad technical depth at Coherent enables us to offer a diverse set of product lines characterized by lasers targeted at growth opportunities and key applications.
21510_16_ITEM1_P13_S7	In all cases, we aim to be the supplier of choice by offering a high-value combination of superior technical performance and high reliability.
21510_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	Photonics has taken its place alongside electronics as a critical enabling technology for the twenty-first century.
21510_16_ITEM1_P14_S1	Photonics based solutions are entrenched in a broad array of industries that include industrial automation, textile processing, microelectronics, flat panel displays and medical diagnostics, with adoption continuing in ever more diverse applications.
21510_16_ITEM1_P14_S2	Growth in these applications stems from two sources.
21510_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	First, there are many applications where the laser is displacing conventional technology because it can do the job faster, better or more economically.
21510_16_ITEM1_P15_S1	Second, there are new applications where the laser is the enabling tool that makes the work possible (e.g., the production of sub 50 micron microvias); these lasers are used in the manufacturing of high density printed circuit boards ("PCBs") found in the latest smart phones and tablet computers.
21510_16_ITEM1_P15_S2	Key laser applications include: semiconductor inspection; manufacturing of advanced PCBs; flat panel display manufacturing; solar cell production; medical and bio-instrumentation; materials processing; metals cutting and welding; industrial process and quality control; marking; imaging and printing; graphic arts and display; and, research and development.
21510_16_ITEM1_P15_S3	For example, ultraviolet ( UV ) lasers are enabling the move towards miniaturization, which drives innovation and growth in many markets.
21510_16_ITEM1_P15_S4	In addition, the advent of industrial grade ultrafast lasers continues to open up new applications for laser processing.
21510_16_ITEM1_P15_S5	We strive to develop innovative and proprietary products and solutions that meet the needs of our customers and that are based on our core expertise in lasers and optical technologies.
21510_16_ITEM1_P15_S6	In pursuit of our strategy, we intend to:
21510_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	Leverage our technology portfolio and application engineering to lead the proliferation of photonics into broader markets We will continue to identify opportunities in which our technology portfolio and application engineering can be used to offer innovative solutions and gain access to new markets.
21510_16_ITEM1_P16_S1	We plan to utilize our expertise to increase our market share in the mid to high power material processing applications.
21510_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	Optimize our leadership position in existing markets There are a number of markets where we have historically been at the forefront of technological development and product deployment and from which we have derived a substantial portion of our revenues.
21510_16_ITEM1_P17_S1	We plan to optimize our financial returns from these markets.
21510_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	Maintain and develop additional strong collaborative customer and industry relationships We believe that the Coherent brand name and reputation for product quality, technical performance and customer satisfaction will help us to further develop our loyal customer base.
21510_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	develop new ones with customers who are industry leaders and work together with these customers to design and develop innovative product systems and solutions as they develop new technologies.
21510_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	Develop and acquire new technologies and market share We will continue to enhance our market position through our existing technologies and develop new technologies through our internal research and development efforts, as well as through the acquisition of additional complementary technologies, intellectual property, manufacturing processes and product offerings.
21510_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	Streamline our manufacturing structure and improve our cost structure We will focus on optimizing the mix of products that we manufacture internally and externally.
21510_16_ITEM1_P21_S1	We will utilize vertical integration where our internal manufacturing process is considered proprietary and seek to leverage external sources when the capabilities and cost structure are well developed and on a path towards commoditization.
21510_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	Focus on long-term improvement of adjusted EBITDA, in dollars and as a percentage of net sales We define adjusted EBITDA as operating income adjusted for depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, major restructuring costs and certain other non-operating income and expense items.
21510_16_ITEM1_P22_S1	Key initiatives to reach our goals for EBITDA improvements include utilization of our Asian manufacturing locations, rationalizing our supply chain and continued leveraging of our infrastructure.
21510_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	APPLICATIONS Our products address a broad range of applications that we group into the following markets: Microelectronics, Materials Processing, OEM Components and Instrumentation and Scientific Research and Government Programs.
21510_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	Microelectronics Nowhere is the trend towards miniaturization more prevalent than in the Microelectronics market where smart phones, tablets, personal computers ("PC's"), televisions ("TV's") and "wearables" are driving advances in displays, integrated circuits and PCBs.
21510_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	In response to market demands and expectations, semiconductor and device manufacturers are continually seeking to improve their process and design technologies in order to manufacture smaller, more powerful and more reliable devices at lower cost.
21510_16_ITEM1_P25_S1	New laser applications and new laser technologies are a key element in delivering higher resolution and higher precision at lower manufacturing cost.
21510_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	We support three major markets in the microelectronics industry: (1) flat panel display ("FPD") manufacturing, (2) advanced packaging and interconnects ("API") and (3) semiconductor front-end ("SEMI").
21510_16_ITEM1_P26_S1	Microelectronics flat panel display manufacturing The high-volume consumer market is driving the production of FPDs in applications such as mobile phones, tablets, laptop computers, TVs and wearables.
21510_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	There are several types of established and emerging displays based on quite different technologies, including liquid crystal ("LCD") and organic light emitting diodes ("OLED").
21510_16_ITEM1_P27_S1	Each of these technologies utilize laser applications due to the fact that lasers enable higher process speed, better yield, improved battery life, lower cost and/or superior display brightness and resolution.
21510_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	Several display types require a high-density pattern of silicon thin film transistors ("TFTs").
21510_16_ITEM1_P28_S1	If this silicon is polycrystalline as opposed to amorphous, the display performance is greatly enhanced.
21510_16_ITEM1_P28_S2	In the past, these polysilicon layers could only be produced on expensive special glass at high temperatures.
21510_16_ITEM1_P28_S3	However, excimer-based processes, such as excimer laser annealing ("ELA") have allowed high-volume production of low-temperature polysilicon ("LTPS") on conventional glass substrates as well as flexible displays on plastic substrates.
21510_16_ITEM1_P28_S4	Our excimer lasers provide a unique solution for LTPS because they are the only industrial-grade excimer lasers optimized for this application.
21510_16_ITEM1_P28_S5	The current state-of-the-art product for this application is our excimer VYPER laser, which delivers over 1000W of power, enabling customers to scale to current Generation 5.5 6 substrates all the way up to Generation 8 sizes.
21510_16_ITEM1_P28_S6	These systems are integral to the manufacturing process on all leading LTPS-based smart phone displays, with the highest commercially available pixel densities of greater than 300 pixels per inch (ppi), with the current trends going to even higher ppi ( 500 ppi) for high end smart phones, and hold the potential for deployment in tablet display and OLED TV manufacturing.
21510_16_ITEM1_P28_S7	Excimer based LTPS is also enabling a new generation of flexible OLED displays which have already seen some implementation in leading smart phones and wearables and are poised for rapid growth in the near future.
21510_16_ITEM1_P28_S8	Our AVIA, Rapid, Talisker, Monaco and DIAMOND CO 2 and CO lasers are also used in other production processes for FPDs.
21510_16_ITEM1_P28_S9	These processes include drilling, cutting, patterning, marking and yield improvement.
21510_16_ITEM1_P29_S0	After a wafer is patterned, there are then a host of other processes, referred to as back-end processing, which finally result in a packaged encapsulated silicon chip.
21510_16_ITEM1_P29_S1	Ultimately, these chips are then assembled into finished products.
21510_16_ITEM1_P30_S0	The advent of high-speed logic and high-memory content devices has caused chip manufacturers to look for alternative technologies to improve performance and lower process costs.
21510_16_ITEM1_P30_S1	In terms of materials, this search includes new types of materials, such as low-k and thinner silicon.
21510_16_ITEM1_P30_S2	Our AVIA, Rapid, Talisker, Monaco and Matrix lasers provide economical methods of cutting and scribing these wafers while delivering higher yields than traditional mechanical methods.
21510_16_ITEM1_P30_S3	There are similar trends in chip packaging and PCB manufacturing requiring more compact packaging and denser interconnects.
21510_16_ITEM1_P31_S0	In many cases, lasers present enabling technologies.
21510_16_ITEM1_P31_S1	For instance, lasers are now the only economically practical method for drilling microvias in chip substrates and in both rigid and flexible PCBs.
21510_16_ITEM1_P31_S2	These microvias are tiny interconnects that are essential for enabling high-density circuitry commonly used in smart phones, tablets and advanced computing systems.
21510_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	Our DIAMOND CO 2 and AVIA diode pumped solid state ("DPSS") lasers are the lasers of choice in this application.
21510_16_ITEM1_P32_S1	The ability of these lasers to operate at very high repetition rates translates into faster drilling speeds and increased throughput in microvia processing applications.
21510_16_ITEM1_P32_S2	In addition, multi-layer circuit boards require more flexible production methods than conventional printing technologies can offer, which has led to widespread adoption of laser direct imaging ("LDI").
21510_16_ITEM1_P32_S3	Our Paladin laser is used for this application.
21510_16_ITEM1_P32_S4	Lasers have also become a valuable tool in high-brightness ("HB") light-emitting diode ("LED") manufacturing, improving LED performance and yield.
21510_16_ITEM1_P32_S5	LEDs have widespread adoption as the light source in all categories of LCD displays, from phones all the way to full size TVs and moving into general lighting.
21510_16_ITEM1_P32_S6	Our lasers are used in back-end processing of HB-LEDs.
21510_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	Microelectronics semiconductor front-end The term "front-end" refers to the production of semiconductor devices which occurs prior to packaging.
21510_16_ITEM1_P33_S1	As semiconductor device geometries decrease in size, devices become increasingly susceptible to smaller defects during each phase of the manufacturing process and these defects can negatively impact yield.
21510_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	One of the semiconductor industry's responses to the increasing vulnerability of semiconductor devices to smaller defects has been to use defect detection and inspection techniques that are closely linked to the manufacturing process.
21510_16_ITEM1_P34_S1	For example, automated laser-based inspection systems are now used to detect and locate defects as small as 0.01 micron, which may not be observable by conventional optical microscopes.
21510_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	Detecting the presence of defects is only the first step in preventing their recurrence.
21510_16_ITEM1_P35_S1	After detection, defects must be examined in order to identify their size, shape and the process step in which the defect occurred.
21510_16_ITEM1_P35_S2	This examination is called defect classification.
21510_16_ITEM1_P35_S3	Identification of the sources of defects in the lengthy and complex semiconductor manufacturing process has become essential for maintaining high yield production.
21510_16_ITEM1_P35_S4	Semiconductor manufacturing has become an around-the-clock operation and it is important for products used for inspection, measurement and testing to be reliable and to have long lifetimes.
21510_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	Our Azure, Paladin and Excimer lasers are used to detect and characterize defects in semiconductor chips.
21510_16_ITEM1_P37_S0	Materials processing Lasers are widely accepted today in many important industrial manufacturing applications including cutting, welding, joining, drilling, perforating, and marking of metals and nonmetals.

21510_16_ITEM1_P38_S1	In the specific area of textiles and clothing, our DIAMOND lasers service older applications, such as cutting complex shapes in leather for footwear, as well as newer applications such as creating detailed fade patterns on designer denims.
21510_16_ITEM1_P38_S2	Laser marking and coding are generally considered part of the precision materials processing applications market for which we remain a leading supplier.
21510_16_ITEM1_P38_S3	The optimum choice of laser depends on the material being marked, whether it is a surface mark (engraved) or a sub-surface mark, and the specific economics of the application.
21510_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	Our DIAMOND J, C and GEM Series of CO 2 lasers provide many systems manufacturers with a reliable cost effective source for marking and engraving on non-metals.
21510_16_ITEM1_P39_S1	In addition, our Matrix and Helios product lines of reliable, compact and low-cost DPSS lasers provide an ideal solution for marking of other materials in high volume manufacturing.

21510_16_ITEM1_P39_S5	We also support the laser-based instrumentation market with a range of laser-related components, including diode lasers for optical pumping.
21510_16_ITEM1_P39_S6	Our OEM component business includes sales to other, less integrated laser manufacturers participating in OEM markets such as materials processing, scientific, and medical.
21510_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	Bio-instrumentation Bio-instrumentation applications for lasers include bio-agent detection for point source and standoff detection of pathogens or other bio-toxins; confocal microscopy for biological imaging that allows researchers and clinicians to visualize cellular and subcellular structures and processes with an incredible amount of detail; DNA sequencing that provides automation and data acquisition rates that would be impossible by any other method; drug discovery genomic and proteomic analyses that enable drug discovery to proceed at very high throughput rates; and flow cytometry for analyzing single cells or populations of cells in a heterogeneous mixture, including blood samples.
21510_16_ITEM1_P40_S1	Our OBIS, Flare, Galaxy, Sapphire, BioRay and Genesis lasers are used in several bio-instrumentation applications.
21510_16_ITEM1_P40_S2	Medical Therapy We sell a variety of components and lasers to medical laser companies in end-user applications such as ophthalmology, aesthetic, surgical, therapeutic and dentistry.

21510_16_ITEM1_P40_S4	We have a leading position in Lasik and photorefractive keratectomy surgery methods with our ExciStar XS excimer laser platform.
21510_16_ITEM1_P40_S5	We also provide ultrafast lasers for use in cataract surgery, a growing applications space.
21510_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	The unique ability of our optically pumped semiconductor lasers ("OPSL") technology to match a wavelength to an application has led to the development of a high-power yellow (577nm) laser for the treatment of eye related diseases, such as Age Related Macular Degeneration and retinal diseases associated with diabetes.
21510_16_ITEM1_P41_S1	The 577nm wavelength was designed to match the peak in absorption of oxygenated hemoglobin thereby allowing treatment to occur at a lower power level, and thus reducing stress and heat-load placed on the eye with traditional green-based (530nm) solid state lasers.
21510_16_ITEM1_P41_S2	Other applications where our OBIS, Genesis and Sapphire series of lasers are used include the retinal scanning market in diagnostic imaging systems as well as new ground breaking in-vivo imaging.
21510_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	Scientific research and government programs We are widely recognized as a technology innovator and the scientific market has historically provided an ideal "test market" for our leading-edge innovations.
21510_16_ITEM1_P42_S1	These have included ultrafast lasers, DPSS lasers, continuous-wave ("CW") systems, excimer gas lasers and water-cooled ion gas lasers.
21510_16_ITEM1_P42_S2	Our portfolio of lasers that address the scientific research market is broad and includes our Chameleon, COMPexPro, Evolution, Fidelity, Legend, Libra, MBD, MBR, Monaco, Vitara, Mephisto, Mira and Verdi lasers.
21510_16_ITEM1_P42_S3	Many of the innovations and products pioneered in the scientific marketplace have become commercial successes for both our OEM customers and us.
21510_16_ITEM1_P42_S4	We have a large installed base of scientific lasers which are used in a wide range of applications spanning virtually every branch of science and engineering.
21510_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	Most of these applications require the use of ultrafast lasers that enable the generation of pulses short enough to be measured in femto- or attoseconds (10 -15 to 10 -18 seconds).
21510_16_ITEM1_P43_S1	Because of these very short pulse durations, ultrafast lasers enable the study of fundamental physical and chemical processes with temporal resolution unachievable with any other tool.
21510_16_ITEM1_P43_S2	These lasers also deliver very high peak power and large bandwidths, which can be used to generate many exotic effects.
21510_16_ITEM1_P43_S3	Some of these are now finding their way into mainstream applications, such as microscopy or materials processing.
21510_16_ITEM1_P43_S4	The use of ultrafast lasers such as the Chameleon in microscopy is now a common occurrence in bio-imaging labs, and they have become a crucial tool in modern brain research.
21510_16_ITEM1_P43_S5	We recently released a new product called the Chameleon Discovery targeted to this market.
21510_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	FUTURE TRENDS Microelectronics Lasers are widely used in mass production microelectronics applications largely because they enable entirely new application capabilities that cannot be realized by any other known means.
21510_16_ITEM1_P44_S1	These laser-based fabrication and testing methods provide a level of precision, typically on a micrometer and nanometer level, that are unique, faster, are touch free, deliver superior end products, increase yields, and/or cut production costs.
21510_16_ITEM1_P44_S2	We anticipate this trend to continue, driven primarily by the increasing sophistication and miniaturization of consumer electronic goods and their convergence via the internet, resulting in increasing demand for better displays, more bandwidth and memory, and all packaged into devices which are lighter, thinner and consume less power.
21510_16_ITEM1_P44_S3	Although this market follows the macro-economic trends and carries inherent risks, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to capitalize on the current market trends and that we will see continued increased adoption of our solid-state, CO 2 , fiber, direct diode and excimer lasers, as all these lasers enable entirely new applications, performance improvements and reduced process costs.
21510_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	Excimer laser based LTPS is a key technology for producing high resolution OLED displays in general and flexible OLED displays in particular.
21510_16_ITEM1_P45_S1	We believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the rapid growth that is projected for OLED displays in smart phones and other mobile devices over the next several years with our Vyper and LineBeam systems.
21510_16_ITEM1_P45_S2	CO 2 , Avia, Matrix, Rapid, Talisker, Helios and direct diode lasers all seem aligned with the need for related FPD touch panel, film cutting, light guide technology, repair, frit welding, as well as sapphire and glass-cutting applications.
21510_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	The trend for thinner and lighter devices is impacting the glass substrates used in today s mobile devices requiring thinner glass with higher degrees of mechanical strength and scratch resistance.
21510_16_ITEM1_P46_S1	This trend also includes use of sapphire instead of glass.
21510_16_ITEM1_P46_S2	Mechanical means of cutting these glass and sapphire pieces are no longer adequate to meet future requirements and we expect lasers to play an increased role.
21510_16_ITEM1_P46_S3	Our CO, CO 2, Monaco and Rapid lasers are well positioned to take advantage of this trend.
21510_16_ITEM1_P46_S4	Semiconductor devices look set to continue Moore's Law, shrinking device geometries for at least another decade, as well as expanding vertically into new 3D structures.
21510_16_ITEM1_P46_S5	As a result we believe our many UV laser sources (such as Azure, Paladin, Avia, Rapid, ExiStar and Matrix) will continue to find increasing adoption, since their unique optical properties align well with the process demands of a nanometer scale world.
21510_16_ITEM1_P46_S6	The same lasers plus Monaco, Rapid FX, CO and CO 2 are also widely adopted for back end Advanced Packaging and Interconnect (API) applications.
21510_16_ITEM1_P46_S7	With dimension roadmaps showing a decade of dimension shrink on PCBs, interconnects, Silicon LED scribe widths and wafer thickness, we believe that our portfolio of lasers aligns well with these demands as well as new processes that seem likely to be enabled by our lasers, to meet the increasing demands and decreasing tolerances of these markets.
21510_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	Materials processing The market for low to medium power CO 2 , solid state and semiconductor lasers used in industrial materials processing is very diverse.
21510_16_ITEM1_P47_S1	New product introductions such as our Diamond J-series CO 2 and CO lasers continue to support our growth in this area.
21510_16_ITEM1_P47_S2	These lasers represent a cost-effective manufacturing solution for cutting, joining, marking and engraving of non-metal materials including marking/coding, flat bed cutting, engraving, as well as the production of capital equipment for apparel and leather goods manufacturing.
21510_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	The market for kW class fiber lasers has seen strong growth in recent years, replacing legacy multi-kW CO 2 lasers in metal cutting and other applications.
21510_16_ITEM1_P48_S1	This trend will likely continue into the future.
21510_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	The favorable cost of ownership of high power diode and fiber lasers has expanded their use in a number of metal processing applications in addition to cutting.
21510_16_ITEM1_P49_S1	They have seen adoption in welding and brazing applications as well as newer growth areas in additive manufacturing like cladding and 3D printing.
21510_16_ITEM1_P49_S2	We believe we are well positioned to benefit from these large and growing markets with our line of kW fiber and diode lasers.
21510_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	We have developed an expanded portfolio of lasers with a broad spectrum of wavelengths and power levels, enabling optimum solutions for virtually every metal and non-metal material type.
21510_16_ITEM1_P50_S1	At the same time, the higher reliability of these products has lowered the cost of ownership.
21510_16_ITEM1_P50_S2	The bio instrumentation market is on a steady path in the most important areas: microscopy, flow cytometry and DNA sequencing, which all are enjoying solid research funding on a worldwide basis with some local variations.
21510_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	In this field, our OPSL technology gives us differentiated products at a number of important wavelengths.
21510_16_ITEM1_P51_S1	This advantage coupled with strong focus on meeting our customers demands for more compact and cost effective sources has made us very successful and we expect that to continue.
21510_16_ITEM1_P51_S2	Our OPSL technology resulted in the first truly continuous wave solid-state UV laser which enables the use of UV in a clinical as well as a research environment.
21510_16_ITEM1_P52_S0	In the medical therapeutic area, we see solid business with several opportunities for growth.
21510_16_ITEM1_P52_S1	We supply excimer lasers used in refractive eye surgery and are actively involved in further developments in laser vision correction including the use of ultrafast lasers in applications such as laser cataract surgery where higher precision and use of advanced implants enable better and more reliable patient outcomes.
21510_16_ITEM1_P52_S2	Laser cataract surgery is still at a relatively early stage of adoption and is expected to see continued growth over the next several years.
21510_16_ITEM1_P52_S3	We also have opportunities in dental procedures for both hard and soft tissue ablation, with greatly improved patient comfort and outcome.
21510_16_ITEM1_P53_S0	In the area of photocoagulation, our Genesis OPSL yellow lasers are being used as the wavelength is particularly suitable for the treatment of blood vessels.
21510_16_ITEM1_P53_S1	In aesthetic laser procedures, we are an OEM supplier of CO 2 and semiconductor lasers to the major manufacturers of equipment used in the latest procedures in dermatology and hair removal.
21510_16_ITEM1_P54_S0	Scientific research and government programs Worldwide scientific funding seems very stable overall, with some regions growing and others just holding their current level.

21510_16_ITEM1_P59_S0	TECHNOLOGIES Diode-pumped solid-state lasers DPSS lasers use semiconductor lasers to pump a crystal to produce a laser beam.
21510_16_ITEM1_P59_S1	By changing the energy, optical components and the types of crystals used in the laser, different wavelengths and types of laser light can be produced.
21510_16_ITEM1_P60_S0	The efficiency, reliability, longevity and relatively low cost of DPSS lasers make them ideally suited for a wide range of OEM and end-user applications, particularly those requiring 24-hour operations.
21510_16_ITEM1_P61_S0	Our DPSS systems are compact and self-contained sealed units.
21510_16_ITEM1_P61_S1	Unlike conventional tools and other lasers, our DPSS lasers require minimal maintenance since they do not have internal controls or components that require adjusting and cleaning to maintain consistency.
21510_16_ITEM1_P61_S2	They are also less affected by environmental changes in temperature and humidity, which can alter alignment and inhibit performance in many systems.
21510_16_ITEM1_P62_S0	We manufacture a variety of types of DPSS lasers for different applications including semiconductor inspection; advanced packaging and interconnects; laser pumping; spectroscopy; bio-agent detection; DNA sequencing; drug discovery; flow cytometry; forensics; computer-to-plate printing; entertainment lighting (display); medical; rapid prototyping and marking, welding, engraving, cutting and drilling.
21510_16_ITEM1_P63_S0	Fiber lasers Fiber lasers use semiconductor lasers to pump a doped optical fiber to produce a laser beam.
21510_16_ITEM1_P63_S1	The unique features of a fiber laser make them suitable for producing high power, continuous wave laser beams.
21510_16_ITEM1_P63_S2	We introduced a multi kilowatt fiber laser platform in fiscal 2015.
21510_16_ITEM1_P63_S3	Our fiber laser design has several unique features including a modular design for improved serviceability and diode bar based pumping.
21510_16_ITEM1_P63_S4	Due to packaging efficiency, diode bars reduce the overall cost of a fiber laser.
21510_16_ITEM1_P64_S0	Some of the most critical components inside a fiber laser include the gain fiber itself and the diodes providing the pump power.
21510_16_ITEM1_P64_S1	We are well positioned as a fiber laser supplier since we are vertically integrated with respect to these key technologies; we use diode bars and fiber manufactured in-house.
21510_16_ITEM1_P64_S2	We plan to continue to drive cost reduction in our diode laser pumps and demonstrate the scalability of the platform by moving up the power scale into the multi kilowatt regime.
21510_16_ITEM1_P64_S3	This platform will address the large growing high power metal cutting and joining market.
21510_16_ITEM1_P65_S0	Gas lasers (CO, CO 2 , Excimer, Ion) The breadth of our gas laser portfolio is industry leading, encompassing CO, CO 2 , excimer and ion laser technologies.
21510_16_ITEM1_P66_S0	Gas lasers derive their name from the use of one or more gases as a lasing medium.
21510_16_ITEM1_P66_S1	They collectively span an extremely diverse and useful emission range, from the very deep ultraviolet to the far infrared.
21510_16_ITEM1_P66_S2	This diverse range of available wavelengths, coupled with high optical output power, and an abundance of other attractive characteristics, makes gas lasers extremely useful and popular for a variety of microelectronics, scientific, medical therapeutic and materials processing applications.
21510_16_ITEM1_P67_S0	Our OPSL platform is a surface emitting semiconductor laser that is energized or pumped by a semiconductor laser.
21510_16_ITEM1_P67_S1	The use of optical pumping circumvents inherent power scaling limitations of electrically pumped lasers, enabling very high powered devices.
21510_16_ITEM1_P67_S2	A wide range of wavelengths can be achieved by varying the semiconductor materials used in the device and changing the frequency of the laser beam using techniques common in solid state lasers.
21510_16_ITEM1_P67_S3	The platform leverages high reliability technologies developed for telecommunications and produces a compact, rugged, high power, single-mode laser.
21510_16_ITEM1_P67_S4	Our OPSL products are well suited to a wide range of applications, including the bio-instrumentation, medical therapeutics and graphic arts and display markets.
21510_16_ITEM1_P67_S5	We continue to expand our ultraviolet version of the OPSL platform called the Genesis, which was developed for the bio-instrumentation market.
21510_16_ITEM1_P68_S0	Semiconductor lasers High power edge emitting semiconductor diode lasers use the same principles as widely-used CD and DVD lasers, but produce significantly higher power levels.
21510_16_ITEM1_P68_S1	The advantages of this type of laser include smaller size, longer life, enhanced reliability and greater efficiency.
21510_16_ITEM1_P69_S0	We manufacture a wide range of discrete semiconductor laser products with wavelengths ranging from 650nm to over 1000nm and output powers ranging from 1W to over 100W, with highly integrated products in the kW range.
21510_16_ITEM1_P69_S1	These products are available in a variety of industry standard form factors including the following: bare die, packaged and fiber coupled single emitters and bars, monolithic stacks and fully integrated modules with microprocessor controlled units that contain power supplies and active coolers.
21510_16_ITEM1_P70_S0	removal, cosmetic dentistry), graphic arts, counter measures, rangefinders, target designators, cladding, hardening and plastic welding.
21510_16_ITEM1_P71_S0	Lasers Ultrafast lasers are lasers generating light pulses with durations of a few femtoseconds (10 -15 seconds) to a few tens of picoseconds (10 -11 seconds).
21510_16_ITEM1_P71_S1	These types of lasers are used for medical, advanced microelectronics and materials processing applications as well as scientific research.
21510_16_ITEM1_P71_S2	UF laser oscillators generate a train of pulses at 50-100 MHz, with peak powers of tens of kilowatts, and UF laser amplifiers generate pulses at 1-2000 kHz, with peak powers up to several Terawatts.
21510_16_ITEM1_P71_S3	The extremely short duration of UF laser pulses enables temporally resolving fast events like the dynamics of atoms or electrons.
21510_16_ITEM1_P71_S4	In addition, the high peak power enables so-called non-linear effects where several photons can be absorbed by a molecule at the same time.
21510_16_ITEM1_P71_S5	This type of process enables applications like multi-photon excitation microscopy or UF ablation of materials with high precision and minimal thermal damage.
21510_16_ITEM1_P72_S0	The use of our ultrafast lasers in applications outside science has been growing rapidly over the last several years, particularly in microelectronics and materials processing applications.

21510_16_ITEM1_P77_S0	We work closely with customers, both individually and through our sponsored seminars, to develop products to meet customer application and performance needs.
21510_16_ITEM1_P77_S1	In addition, we are working with leading research and educational institutions to develop new photonics based solutions.
21510_16_ITEM1_P78_S0	MANUFACTURING Strategies One of our core manufacturing strategies is to tightly control our supply of key parts, components, sub-assemblies and outsourcing partners.
21510_16_ITEM1_P78_S1	We primarily utilize vertical integration when we have proprietary internal capabilities that are not cost-effectively available from external sources.
21510_16_ITEM1_P78_S2	We believe this is essential to maintain high quality products and enable rapid development and deployment of new products and technologies.
21510_16_ITEM1_P78_S3	We provide customers with 24-hour technical expertise and quality that is International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") certified at our principal manufacturing sites.
21510_16_ITEM1_P78_S4	Committed to quality and customer satisfaction, we design and produce many of our own components and sub-assemblies in order to retain quality and performance control.
21510_16_ITEM1_P78_S5	We have also outsourced certain components, sub-assemblies and finished goods where we can maintain our high quality standards while improving our cost structure.
21510_16_ITEM1_P78_S6	As part of our strategy to increase our market share and customer support in Asia as well as our continuing efforts to manage costs, we have transferred the production of additional products into both of our Singapore and Malaysia factories.
21510_16_ITEM1_P78_S7	In addition, we expanded our repair activities in our China and South Korea operations and also opened a tube refurbishment manufacturing site in South Korea.
21510_16_ITEM1_P78_S8	This has allowed us to reduce service response time and inventories, providing benefits to us and to our customers.
21510_16_ITEM1_P78_S9	We have also established an International Procurement Office in Singapore and have been increasing our sourcing of materials from Asia to reduce material costs on a global basis.
21510_16_ITEM1_P78_S10	In fiscal 2015, we increased our vertical integration capabilities with the asset acquisition of the Tinsley Optics business from L-3 Communications Corporation.
21510_16_ITEM1_P79_S0	We have designed and implemented proprietary manufacturing tools, equipment and techniques in an effort to provide products that differentiate us from our competitors.
21510_16_ITEM1_P79_S1	These proprietary manufacturing techniques are utilized in a number of our product lines including our gas laser production, crystal growth, beam alignment as well as the wafer growth for our semiconductor and optically pumped semiconductor laser product family.
21510_16_ITEM1_P80_S0	Raw materials or sub-components required in the manufacturing process are generally available from several sources.
21510_16_ITEM1_P80_S1	However, we currently purchase several key components and materials, including exotic materials, crystals and optics, used in the manufacture of our products from sole source or limited source suppliers.
21510_16_ITEM1_P80_S2	We also purchase assemblies and turnkey solutions from contract manufacturers based on our proprietary designs.

21510_16_ITEM1_P81_S0	INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights.
21510_16_ITEM1_P81_S1	As of October 1, 2016 , we held approximately 565 U.S. and foreign patents, which expire from 2016 through 2032 (depending on the payment of maintenance fees) and we have approximately 133 additional pending patent applications that have been filed.
21510_16_ITEM1_P81_S2	The issued patents cover various products in all of the major markets that we serve.
21510_16_ITEM1_P82_S0	For a discussion of the importance to our business of, and the risks attendant to intellectual property rights, see "Risk Factors" in Item 1A "We may not be able to protect our proprietary technology which could adversely affect our competitive advantage" and "We may, in the future, be subject to claims or litigation from third parties, for claims of infringement of their proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of competitors or other rights holders.
21510_16_ITEM1_P82_S1	These claims could result in costly litigation and the diversion of our technical and management personnel.
21510_16_ITEM1_P83_S0	COMPETITION Competition in the various photonics markets in which we provide products is very intense.
21510_16_ITEM1_P83_S1	We compete against a number of large public and private companies including CVI Melles Griot, Novanta Inc., IPG Photonics Corporation, Lumentum Holdings Inc., MKS Instruments, Inc., and Trumpf GmbH, as well as other smaller companies.
21510_16_ITEM1_P83_S2	We compete globally based on our broad product offering, reliability, cost, and performance advantages for the widest range of commercial and scientific research applications.
21510_16_ITEM1_P83_S3	Other considerations by our customers include warranty, global service and support and distribution.
21510_16_ITEM1_P83_S4	At fiscal 2016 year-end, our backlog of orders scheduled for shipment (within one year) was $605.3 million compared to $309.5 million at fiscal 2015 year-end.
21510_16_ITEM1_P83_S5	By segment, backlog for SLS was $515.2 million and $219.3 million , respectively, at fiscal 2016 and 2015 year-ends.
21510_16_ITEM1_P83_S6	Backlog for CLC was $90.1 million and $90.2 million , respectively, at fiscal 2016 and 2015 year-ends.
21510_16_ITEM1_P83_S7	The increase in SLS backlog from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 year-end is primarily due to timing of large excimer laser annealing system orders, net of shipments, for the flat panel display market, which explains the increase in overall company backlog as well.
21510_16_ITEM1_P83_S8	Orders used to compute backlog are generally cancelable and, depending on the notice period, are subject to rescheduling by our customers without substantial penalties.
21510_16_ITEM1_P83_S9	Historically, we have not experienced a significant rate of cancellation or rescheduling, though we cannot guarantee that the rate of cancellations or rescheduling will not increase in the future.
21510_16_ITEM1_P83_S10	We have historically experienced decreased revenue in the first fiscal quarter compared to other quarters in our fiscal year due to the impact of time off and business closures at our facilities and those of many of our customers due to year-end holidays.
21510_16_ITEM1_P83_S11	For example over the past 10 years we have noted, excluding certain recovery years, our first fiscal quarter revenues have ranged 2%-12% below the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal years.
21510_16_ITEM1_P83_S12	This historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's future net sales or financial performance.
21510_16_ITEM1_P84_S0	As of fiscal 2016 year-end, we had 2,787 employees.
21510_16_ITEM1_P84_S1	Approximately 396 of our employees are involved in research and development; 1,786 of our employees are involved in operations, manufacturing, service and quality assurance; and 605 of our employees are involved in sales, order administration, marketing, finance, information technology, general management and other administrative functions.
21510_16_ITEM1_P84_S2	Our success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain employees.
21510_16_ITEM1_P84_S3	We face competition in this regard from other companies, research and academic institutions, government entities and other organizations.
21510_16_ITEM1_P84_S4	We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
21510_16_ITEM1_P85_S0	On November 7, 2016, we acquired Rofin, one of the world's leading developers and manufacturers of high-performance industrial laser sources and laser-based solutions and components.
21510_16_ITEM1_P85_S1	See "Recent Developments" for further discussion of the acquisition and the Credit Agreement.
21510_16_ITEM1_P86_S0	In July 2015, we acquired certain assets of Raydiance, Inc. ("Raydiance") for approximately $5.0 million, excluding transaction costs.

21510_16_ITEM1_P88_S0	In July 2015, we acquired the assets and certain liabilities of the Tinsley Optics ("Tinsley") business from L-3 Communications Corporation for approximately $4.3 million, excluding transaction costs.
21510_16_ITEM1_P89_S0	Tinsley is a specialized manufacturer of high precision optical components and subsystems sold primarily in the aerospace and defense industry.
21510_16_ITEM1_P89_S1	Tinsley manufactures the large form factor optics for our excimer laser annealing systems.
21510_16_ITEM1_P89_S2	The Tinsley assets have been included in our Specialty Lasers and Systems segment.
21510_16_ITEM1_P89_S3	Business Combinations" of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of this annual report for further discussion of recent acquisitions completed.
21510_16_ITEM1_P90_S0	Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, handling and disposal of regulated materials, chemicals, various radioactive materials and certain waste products.
21510_16_ITEM1_P90_S1	In the United States, we are subject to the federal regulation and control of the Environmental Protection Agency.
21510_16_ITEM1_P90_S2	Comparable authorities are involved in other countries.
21510_16_ITEM1_P90_S3	Such rules are subject to change by the governing agency and we monitor those changes closely.
21510_16_ITEM1_P90_S4	We expect all operations to meet the legal and regulatory environmental requirements and believe that compliance with those regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive and financial position.
21510_16_ITEM1_P90_S5	Although we believe that our safety procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of such materials comply with the standards required by federal and state laws and regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials.
21510_16_ITEM1_P90_S6	In the event of such an accident involving such materials, we could be liable for damages and such liability could exceed the amount of our liability insurance coverage and the resources of our business.
21510_16_ITEM1_P91_S0	We may face the potential of increasing complexity in our product designs and procurement operations due to the evolving nature of product compliance standards.
21510_16_ITEM1_P91_S1	Those standards may impact the material composition of our products entering specific markets.
21510_16_ITEM1_P91_S2	Such regulations went into effect in the European Union ("EU") in 2006, (The Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS)) and 2007 (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH)), and China in 2007 (Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products Regulation (China-RoHS)), and the US Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.
21510_16_ITEM1_P91_S3	Furthermore, we could face costs and liabilities in connection with product take-back legislation.
21510_16_ITEM1_P92_S0	Beginning in 2006, the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive made producers of electrical goods financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products.
21510_16_ITEM1_P92_S1	Similar laws are now pending in various jurisdictions around the world, including the United States.
21510_16_ITEM1_P93_S0	Environmental liabilities Our operations are subject to various laws and regulations governing the environment, including the discharge of pollutants and the management and disposal of hazardous substances.
21510_16_ITEM1_P93_S1	As a result of our historic as well as on-going operations, we could incur substantial costs, including remediation costs.
21510_16_ITEM1_P93_S2	The costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to predict.
21510_16_ITEM1_P93_S3	Our accruals for such costs and liabilities may not be adequate because the estimates on which the accruals are based depend on a number of factors including the nature of the matter, the complexity of the site, site geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) at multi-party sites and the number and financial viability of other PRPs.
21510_16_ITEM1_P94_S0	We are organized into two operating segments: SLS and CLC.
21510_16_ITEM1_P95_S0	This segmentation reflects the go-to-market strategies for various products and markets.
21510_16_ITEM1_P95_S1	While both segments deliver cost-effective photonics solutions, SLS develops and manufactures configurable, advanced performance products largely serving the microelectronics, scientific research and government programs and OEM components and instrumentation markets.
21510_16_ITEM1_P95_S2	The size and complexity of many of the SLS products require service to be performed at the customer site by factory-trained field service engineers.
21510_16_ITEM1_P96_S0	CLC focuses on higher volume products that are offered in set configurations.
21510_16_ITEM1_P96_S1	The product architectures are designed for easy exchange at the point of use such that substantially all product service and repairs are based upon advanced replacement and depot (i.e., factory) repair.
21510_16_ITEM1_P97_S0	CLC's primary markets include materials processing, OEM components and instrumentation and microelectronics.
21510_16_ITEM1_P98_S0	We have identified SLS and CLC as operating segments for which discrete financial information was available.
21510_16_ITEM1_P98_S1	Both units have dedicated engineering, manufacturing, product business management and product line management functions.
21510_16_ITEM1_P99_S0	small portion of our outside revenue is attributable to projects and recently developed products for which a segment has not yet been determined.
21510_16_ITEM1_P100_S0	The associated direct and indirect costs are presented in the category of Corporate and other, along with other corporate costs.
21510_16_ITEM1_P101_S0	FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND EXPORT SALES Financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations for fiscal years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , is set forth in Note 15, "Segment and Geographic Information" of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of this annual report.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We may not be able to integrate the business of Rofin successfully with our own or realize the anticipated benefits of the merger.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating our business practices with those of Rofin.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Potential difficulties that we may encounter as part of the integration process include the following:
21510_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or delays related to the merger and the integration of Rofin, including as a result of the requirement for holding separate Rofin s business located in Hull, England.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	In addition, we have operated independently prior to the merger and it is possible that the integration process following the merger could result in:
21510_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, our business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures or policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger, or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	In addition, prior to the merger, Rofin s business faced risks and uncertainties, including those faced by our business and identified below.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Rofin s business may not meet future expectations due to these factors despite our integration efforts.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following the merger.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Following the merger, the size of the business of the combined company has increased significantly.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage this expanded business, which will pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P4_S2	There can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected synergies and benefits anticipated from the merger.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P4_S3	We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial expenses related to the merger with and the integration of Rofin.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P4_S4	We have and expect to continue to incur substantial expenses in connection with the merger and the integration of Rofin.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that will need to be integrated, including purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, payroll, pricing, marketing and employee benefits.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	While we have assumed that a certain level of expenses will be incurred, there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Moreover, many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P5_S3	These expenses could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P5_S4	These integration expenses could result in significant charges to earnings which we cannot currently quantify.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Charges to earnings resulting from the application of the purchase method of accounting to the Rofin acquisition may adversely affect our results of operations.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we will account for the Rofin acquisition using the purchase method of accounting, which will result in charges to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock following completion of the acquisition.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Under the purchase method of accounting, we will allocate the total purchase price of Rofin s net tangible and identifiable intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P6_S3	The excess of the purchase price over net tangible and identifiable intangible assets will be recorded as goodwill.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P6_S4	We will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P6_S5	In addition, to the extent the value of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives becomes impaired, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P6_S6	These depreciation, amortization and potential impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our indebtedness following the merger is substantially greater than our indebtedness prior to the merger.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	This increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect us, including by decreasing our business flexibility, and will increase our borrowing costs.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In November 2016 we entered into the Credit Agreement which provides for a 670 million Euro term loan, all of which has been drawn, and a $100 million revolving credit facility, under which a 10 million Euro letter of credit has been issued.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P7_S3	We may incur additional indebtedness in the future by accessing the revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement and/or entering into new financing arrangements.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal of our current indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations and the ongoing interest rate environment.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P7_S5	There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, including covenants regarding the payment of taxes and other obligations, maintenance of insurance, reporting requirements and compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and negative covenants, including covenants limiting the ability of us and our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur debt, grant liens, make investments, make certain restricted payments, transact with affiliates, and sell assets.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The Credit Agreement also requires us and our subsidiaries to maintain a senior secured net leverage ratio as of the last day of each fiscal quarter of less of than or equal to 3.50 to 1.00.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default that include, among other things, payment defaults, cross defaults with certain other indebtedness, violation of covenants, inaccuracy of representations and warranties in any material respect, change in control of the Company and the Borrower, judgment defaults, and bankruptcy and insolvency events.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	If an event of default exists, the lenders may require the immediate payment of all Obligations, as defined in the Credit Agreement, and may exercise certain other rights and remedies provided for under the Credit Agreement, the other loan documents and applicable law.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	The acceleration of such obligations is automatic upon the occurrence of a bankruptcy and insolvency event of default.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P9_S3	There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources or we will be able to arrange financing to repay our borrowings at such time.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Our substantially increased indebtedness and higher debt-to-equity ratio following completion of the merger in comparison to that prior to the merger will have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and will increase our borrowing costs.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P9_S5	In addition, the amount of cash required to service our increased indebtedness levels and thus the demands on our cash resources will be greater than the amount of cash flows required to service our indebtedness or that of Rofin individually prior to the merger.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P9_S6	The increased levels of indebtedness could also reduce funds available for our investments in product development as well as capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases and other activities and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P9_S7	We may not be able to divest the Rofin business located in Hull, England on favorable terms.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P9_S8	On October 26, 2016, the European Commission approved under the EU Merger Regulation our acquisition of Rofin, conditional on the divestment of Rofin s low power CO 2 laser business based in Hull, United Kingdom (the Hull Business ) after the closing of the acquisition.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P9_S9	We are required to hold the Hull Business separate until such time as it is divested.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P9_S10	During fiscal years 2013 through 2015, the Hull Business had annual revenues of approximately 23-25 million British Pound Sterling and, accordingly, we will not have the revenue from the Hull Business once it is sold.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P9_S11	If we are unable to successfully timely divest the Hull Business or if the European Commission does not approve a proposed sale thereof, then a divestiture trustee may be appointed by the European Commission and the terms for any sale of the Hull Business will be at the discretion of such trustee.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P9_S12	During the period of time in which we are holding the Hull Business separate, the conditions for such structure may be a distraction on certain members of our senior management team.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our operating results, including net sales, net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA in dollars and as a percentage of net sales, as well as our stock price have varied in the past, and our future operating results, including those results from the newly acquired Rofin business, will continue to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations based upon numerous factors, including those discussed in this Item 1A and throughout this report.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Our stock price will continue to be subject to daily variations as well.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Our future operating results and stock price may not follow any past trends or meet our guidance and expectations.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Our net sales and operating results, such as adjusted EBITDA percentage, net income (loss) and operating expenses, and our stock price have varied in the past and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year in the future.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P10_S4	We believe a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, could cause these variations and make them difficult to predict, including:
21510_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	distraction of management related to acquisition or divestment activities.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In addition, we often recognize a substantial portion of our sales in the last month of our fiscal quarters.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Our expenses for any given quarter are typically based on expected sales and if sales are below expectations in any given quarter, the adverse impact of the shortfall on our operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P11_S3	We also base our manufacturing on our forecasted product mix for the quarter.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P11_S4	If the actual product mix varies significantly from our forecast, we may not be able to fill some orders during that quarter, which would result in delays in the shipment of our products.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Accordingly, variations in timing of sales, particularly for our higher priced, higher margin products, can cause significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P11_S6	Due to these and other factors, such as varying product mix, we believe that quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year comparisons of our historical operating results may not be meaningful.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P11_S7	You should not rely on our results for any quarter or year as an indication of our future performance.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P11_S8	Our operating results in future quarters and years may be below public market analysts' or investors' expectations, which would likely cause the price of our stock to fall.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P11_S9	In addition, over the past several years, U.S. and global equity markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the stock prices of many technology companies both in and outside our industry.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P11_S10	There has not always been a direct correlation between this volatility and the performance of particular companies subject to these stock price fluctuations.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P11_S11	These factors, as well as general economic and political conditions or investors' concerns regarding the credibility of corporate financial statements, may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our stock in the future.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	supply shortages or price fluctuations that could adversely affect our business, particularly our ability to meet our customers' delivery requirements.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We currently purchase several key components and materials used in the manufacture of our products from sole source or limited source suppliers, both internal and external.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	In particular, from time-to-time our customers require us to ramp up production and/or accelerate delivery schedules of our products.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Our key suppliers may not have the ability to increase their production in line with our customers demands.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P13_S3	This can become acute during times of high growth in our customers businesses.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Our failure to timely receive these key components and materials would likely cause delays in the shipment of our products, which would likely negatively impact both our customers and our business.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Some of these suppliers are relatively small private companies that may discontinue their operations at any time and which may be particularly susceptible to prevailing economic conditions.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Some of our suppliers are located in regions which may be susceptible to natural disasters, such as the flooding in Thailand and the earthquake, tsunami and resulting nuclear disaster in Japan and severe flooding and power loss in the Eastern part of the United States in recent years.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Some may be vulnerable to man-made disasters, such as the recent worldwide shortage of neon gas as a result of the conflict in Ukraine.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We typically purchase our components and materials through purchase orders or agreed upon terms and conditions and we do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with many of these suppliers.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	For certain long-lead time supplies or in order to lock-in pricing, we may be obligated to place purchase orders which are not cancelable or otherwise assume liability for a large amount of the ordered supplies, which limit our ability to adjust down our inventory liability in the event of market downturns or other customer cancellations or rescheduling of their purchase orders for our products.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Some of our products, particularly in the flat panel display industry, require designs and specifications which are at the cutting-edge of available technologies.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Our and our customers' designs and specifications frequently change to meet rapidly evolving market demands.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Accordingly, certain of our products require components and supplies which may be technologically difficult and unpredictable to manufacture.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P16_S3	By their very nature, these types of components may only be available by a single supplier.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P16_S4	These characteristics further pressure the timely delivery of such components.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P16_S5	We may fail to obtain these supplies in a timely manner in the future.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P16_S6	We may experience difficulty identifying alternative sources of supply for certain components used in our products and may have to incur expenses and management distraction in assisting our current and future suppliers to meet our and our customers' technical requirements.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P16_S7	We would experience further delays while identifying, evaluating and testing the products of these potential alternative suppliers.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P16_S8	Furthermore, financial or other difficulties faced by these suppliers or significant changes in demand for these components or materials could limit their availability.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P16_S9	We continue to consolidate our supply base and move supplier locations.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P16_S10	When we transition locations we may increase our inventory of such products as a safety stock during the transition, which may cause the amount of inventory reflected on our balance sheet to increase.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P16_S11	Additionally, many of our customers rely on sole source suppliers.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P16_S12	In the event of a disruption of our customers' supply chain, orders from our customers could decrease or be delayed.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P16_S13	Any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these components or materials, or the inability to obtain these components and materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time, or our failure to properly manage these moves, would impair our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and could cause customers to cancel orders.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P16_S14	We have historically relied exclusively on our own production capability to manufacture certain strategic components, crystals, semiconductor lasers, lasers and laser-based systems and recently acquired the capability to manufacture certain large format optics.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P16_S15	Because we manufacture, package and test these components, products and systems at our own facilities, and such components, products and systems are not readily available from other sources, any interruption in manufacturing would adversely affect our business.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P16_S16	Since many of our products have lengthy qualification periods, our ability to introduce multiple suppliers for parts may be limited.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P16_S17	In addition, our failure to achieve adequate manufacturing yields of these items at our manufacturing facilities may materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P16_S18	We participate in the microelectronics market, which requires significant research and development expenses to develop and maintain products and a failure to achieve market acceptance for our products could have a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P16_S19	The microelectronics market is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product introductions, the volatility of product supply and demand, changing customer requirements and evolving industry standards.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P16_S20	The nature of this market requires significant research and development expenses to participate, with substantial resources invested in advance of material sales of our products to our customers in this market.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P16_S21	Additionally, our product offerings may become obsolete given the frequent introduction of alternative technologies.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P16_S22	In the event either our customers' or our products fail to gain market acceptance, or the microelectronics market fails to grow, it would likely have a significant negative effect on our business and results of operations.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We participate in the flat panel display market, which has a relatively limited number of end customer manufacturers.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Our backlog, timing of net sales and results of operations could be negatively impacted in the event our customers reschedule or cancel orders.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	In the flat panel display market, there are a relatively limited number of manufacturers who are the end customers for our annealing products.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	In fiscal 2016, Advanced Process Systems Corporation, an integrator in the flat panel display market based in South Korea, and Japanese Steel Works, Ltd., an integrator in the flat panel display market based in Japan, contributed more than 10% of our revenue.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Given macroeconomic conditions, varying consumer demand and technical process limitations at manufacturers, our customers may seek to reschedule or cancel orders.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P19_S1	This was recently seen with a requested expedited shipment of a Linebeam 1500 product for our third fiscal quarter of 2015, which delivery date was then changed at the customer s request back to its originally scheduled date in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P19_S2	These larger flat panel-related systems have large average selling prices.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Any rescheduling or canceling of such orders by our customers will likely have a significant impact on our quarterly or annual net sales and results of operations and could negatively impact inventory values and backlog.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Additionally, challenges in meeting evolving technological requirements for these complex products by us and our suppliers could also result in delays in shipments, rescheduled or canceled orders by our customers.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P19_S5	This could negatively impact our backlog, timing of net sales and results of operations.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P19_S6	As of October 1, 2016 , flat panel display systems represented 63% of our backlog, compared to 32% at October 3, 2015.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P19_S7	Since our backlog includes higher average selling price flat panel display systems, any delays or cancellation of shipments could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P19_S8	Some of our laser systems are complex in design and may contain defects that are not detected until deployed by our customers, which could increase our costs and reduce our net sales.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Lasers and laser systems are inherently complex in design and require ongoing regular maintenance.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The manufacture of our lasers, laser products and systems involves a highly complex and precise process.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	As a result of the technological complexity of our products, in particular the flat panel annealing systems, changes in our or our suppliers' manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective materials by us or our suppliers could result in a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and product reliability.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P20_S3	To the extent that we do not achieve and maintain our projected yields or product reliability, our business, operating results, financial condition and customer relationships would be adversely affected.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P20_S4	We provide warranties on a majority of our product sales, and reserves for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P20_S5	The determination of such reserves requires us to make estimates of failure rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P20_S6	We typically establish warranty reserves based on historical warranty costs for each product line.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P20_S7	If actual return rates and/or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates, adjustments to cost of sales may be required in future periods which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P20_S8	Our customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated, including under the end user's peak stress conditions.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P20_S9	In addition, some of our products are combined with products from other vendors, which may contain defects.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P20_S10	As a result, should problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P20_S11	If we are unable to identify and fix defects or other problems, we could experience, among other things:
21510_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	legal actions by our customers and/or their end users.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Continued volatility in the advanced packaging and semiconductor manufacturing markets could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P21_S3	A portion of our net sales in the microelectronics market depends on the demand for our products by advanced packaging applications and semiconductor equipment companies.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P21_S4	These markets have historically been characterized by sudden and severe cyclical variations in product supply and demand, which have often severely affected the demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment, including laser-based tools and systems.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P21_S5	The timing, severity and duration of these market cycles are difficult to predict, and we may not be able to respond effectively to these cycles.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P21_S6	The continuing uncertainty in these markets severely limits our ability to predict our business prospects or financial results in these markets.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	During industry downturns, our net sales from these markets may decline suddenly and significantly.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Our ability to rapidly and effectively reduce our cost structure in response to such downturns is limited by the fixed nature of many of our expenses in the near term and by our need to continue our investment in next-generation product technology and to support and service our products.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	In addition, due to the relatively long manufacturing lead times for some of the systems and subsystems we sell to these markets, we may incur expenditures or purchase raw materials or components for products we cannot sell.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Accordingly, downturns in the semiconductor capital equipment market may materially harm our operating results.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Conversely, when upturns in these markets occur, we must be able to rapidly and effectively increase our manufacturing capacity to meet increases in customer demand that may be extremely rapid, and if we fail to do so we may lose business to our competitors and our relationships with our customers may be harmed.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P22_S5	We are exposed to risks associated with worldwide economic conditions and related uncertainties which could negatively impact demand for our products and results of operations.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P22_S6	Volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets, depressed consumer confidence, government economic policies, negative economic conditions, volatile corporate profits and reduced capital spending could negatively impact demand for our products.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P22_S7	In particular, it is difficult to develop and implement strategy, sustainable business models and efficient operations, as well as effectively manage supply chain relationships in the face of such conditions including uncertainty regarding the ability of some of our suppliers to continue operations and provide us with uninterrupted supply flow.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P22_S8	Our ability to maintain our research and development investments in our broad product offerings may be adversely impacted in the event that our sales decline and do not increase in the future.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P22_S9	Spending and the timing thereof by consumers and businesses have a significant impact on our results and, where such spending is delayed or canceled, it could have a material negative impact on our operating results.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Current global economic conditions remain uncertain and challenging.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Weakness in our end markets could negatively impact our net sales, gross margin and operating expenses, and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Uncertainty in global fiscal policy has likely had an adverse impact on global financial markets and overall economic activity in recent years.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Should this uncertain financial policy recur, it would likely negatively impact global economic activity.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Any weakness in global economies would also likely have negative repercussions on U.S. and global credit and financial markets, and further exacerbate sovereign debt concerns in the European Union.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P24_S3	All of these factors would likely adversely impact the global demand for our products and the performance of our investments, and would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The financial turmoil that has affected the banking system and financial markets in recent years could result in tighter credit markets and lower levels of liquidity in some financial markets.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	There could be a number of follow-on effects from a tightened credit environment on our business, including the insolvency of key suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and/or manufacture products resulting in product delays; inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and/or customer insolvencies; and failure of financial institutions negatively impacting our treasury functions.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P25_S2	In the event our customers are unable to obtain credit or otherwise pay for our shipped products it could significantly impact our ability to collect on our outstanding accounts receivable.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments; impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments; interest rates; cash balances; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Volatility in the financial markets and any overall economic uncertainty increase the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Uncertainty about current global economic conditions could also continue to increase the volatility of our stock price.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P25_S6	In addition, political and social turmoil related to international conflicts, terrorist acts, civil unrest and mass migration may put further pressure on economic conditions in the United States and the rest of the world.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P25_S7	Unstable economic, political and social conditions make it difficult for our customers, our suppliers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P25_S8	If such conditions persist, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P25_S9	Additionally, unstable economic conditions can provide significant pressures and burdens on individuals, which could cause them to engage in inappropriate business conduct.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P25_S10	See Part II, Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are managed through various banks around the world and volatility in the capital and credit market conditions could cause financial institutions to fail or materially harm service levels provided by such banks, both of which could have an adverse impact on our ability to timely access funds.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	World capital and credit markets have been and may continue to experience volatility and disruption.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P26_S2	In some cases, the markets have exerted downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers, as well as pressured the solvency of some financial institutions.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P26_S3	These financial institutions, including banks, have had difficulty timely performing regular services and in some cases have failed or otherwise been largely taken over by governments.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	cash equivalents and short-term investments with a number of financial institutions around the world.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Should some or all of these financial institutions fail or otherwise be unable to timely perform requested services, we would likely have a limited ability to timely access our cash deposited with such institutions, or, in extreme circumstances the failure of such institutions could cause us to be unable to access cash for the foreseeable future.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P27_S2	If we are unable to quickly access our funds when we need them, we may need to increase the use of our existing credit lines or access more expensive credit, if available.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P27_S3	If we are unable to access our cash or if we access existing or additional credit or are unable to access additional credit, it could have a negative impact on our operations, including our reported net income.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P27_S4	In addition, the willingness of financial institutions to continue to accept our cash deposits will impact our ability to diversify our investment risk among institutions.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P27_S5	We are exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P27_S6	Although we have not recognized any material losses on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, future declines in their market values could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Given the global nature of our business, we have investments both domestically and internationally.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	There has recently been growing pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, particularly in Europe where a significant portion of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are invested, which results in corresponding pressure on the valuation of the securities issued by such nations.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Additionally, our overall investment portfolio is often concentrated in government-issued securities such as U.S. Treasury securities and government agencies, corporate notes, commercial paper and money market funds.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, financial results, or other factors.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Additionally, liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations could result in decreased values for our investments in certain government securities.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P29_S4	As a result, the value or liquidity of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments could decline or become materially impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P29_S5	See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to increase our sales volumes and decrease our costs to offset potential declines in the average selling prices ( ASPs ) of our products and, if we are unable to realize greater sales volumes and lower costs, our operating results may suffer.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Our ability to increase our sales volume and our future success depends on the continued growth of the markets for lasers, laser systems and related accessories, as well as our ability to identify, in advance, emerging markets for laser-based systems.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P30_S2	We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify, on a timely basis, new high-growth markets in the future.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Moreover, we cannot assure you that new markets will develop for our products or our customers' products, or that our technology or pricing will enable such markets to develop.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Future demand for our products is uncertain and will depend to a great degree on continued technological development and the introduction of new or enhanced products.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P30_S5	If this does not continue, sales of our products may decline and our business will be harmed.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P30_S6	We have in the past experienced decreases in the ASPs of some of our products.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P30_S7	As competing products become more widely available, the ASPs of our products may decrease.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P30_S8	If we are unable to offset any decrease in our ASPs by increasing our sales volumes, our net sales will decline.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P30_S9	In addition, to maintain our gross margins, we must continue to reduce the cost of manufacturing our products while maintaining their high quality.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	From time to time, our products, like many complex technological products, may fail in greater frequency than anticipated.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P31_S1	This can lead to further charges, which can result in higher costs, lower gross margins and lower operating results.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Furthermore, as ASPs of our current products decline, we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements with higher margins.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P31_S3	If we cannot maintain our gross margins, our operating results could be seriously harmed, particularly if the ASPs of our products decrease significantly.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Our future success depends on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new and enhanced products that meet the needs of our customers.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P31_S5	Our current products address a broad range of commercial and scientific research applications in the photonics markets.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P31_S6	We cannot assure you that the market for these applications will continue to generate significant or consistent demand for our products.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P31_S7	Demand for our products could be significantly diminished by disrupting technologies or products that replace them or render them obsolete.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P31_S8	Furthermore, the new and enhanced products in certain markets generally continue to be smaller in size and have lower ASPs, and therefore, we have to sell more units to maintain revenue levels.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P31_S9	Accordingly, we must continue to invest in research and development in order to develop competitive products.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P31_S10	Our future success depends on our ability to anticipate our customers' needs and develop products that address those needs.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P31_S11	Introduction of new products and product enhancements will require that we effectively transfer production processes from research and development to manufacturing and coordinate our efforts with those of our suppliers to achieve volume production rapidly.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P31_S12	If we fail to transfer production processes effectively, develop product enhancements or introduce new products in sufficient quantities to meet the needs of our customers as scheduled, our net sales may be reduced and our business may be harmed.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We face risks associated with our foreign operations and sales that could harm our financial condition and results of operations.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P32_S1	For fiscal 2016 , fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 , 76% , 73% and 74% , respectively, of our net sales were derived from customers outside of the United States.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P32_S2	A majority of Rofin s sales have also been to customers outside of the United States in recent years.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P32_S3	We anticipate that foreign sales, particularly in Asia, will continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales in the foreseeable future.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P32_S4	A global economic slowdown or a natural disaster could have a negative effect on various foreign markets in which we operate, such as the earthquake, tsunami and resulting nuclear disaster in Japan and the flooding in Thailand in recent years.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P32_S5	Such a slowdown may cause us to reduce our presence in certain countries, which may negatively affect the overall level of business in such countries.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our foreign sales are primarily through our direct sales force.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Additionally, some foreign sales are made through foreign distributors and representatives.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Our foreign operations and sales are subject to a number of risks, including:
21510_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Our business could also be impacted by international conflicts, terrorist and military activity, civil unrest and pandemic illness which could cause a slowdown in customer orders, cause customer order cancellations or negatively impact availability of supplies or limit our ability to timely service our installed base of products.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We are also subject to the risks of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, which could materially adversely affect the sales price of our products in foreign markets, as well as the costs and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P34_S2	While we use forward exchange contracts and other risk management techniques to hedge our foreign currency exposure, we remain exposed to the economic risks of foreign currency fluctuations.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P34_S3	We may not be able to protect our proprietary technology which could adversely affect our competitive advantage.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Maintenance of intellectual property rights and the protection thereof is important to our business.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P34_S5	We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P34_S6	Our patent applications may not be approved, any patents that may be issued may not sufficiently protect our intellectual property and any issued patents may be challenged by third parties.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P34_S7	Other parties may independently develop similar or competing technology or design around any patents that may be issued to us.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P34_S8	We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P34_S9	Further, we may be required to enforce our intellectual property or other proprietary rights through litigation, which, regardless of success, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management's attention.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P34_S10	Additionally, there may be existing patents of which we are unaware that could be pertinent to our business and it is not possible for us to know whether there are patent applications pending that our products might infringe upon since these applications are often not publicly available until a patent is issued or published.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We may, in the future, be subject to claims or litigation from third parties, for claims of infringement of their proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of competitors or other rights holders.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P35_S1	These claims could result in costly litigation and the diversion of our technical and management personnel.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Adverse resolution of litigation may harm our operating results or financial condition.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	In recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States and around the world involving patents and other intellectual property rights.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P36_S1	This has been seen in our industry, for example in the recently concluded patent-related litigation between IMRA America, Inc. ("Imra") and IPG Photonics Corporation and in Imra's recently brought litigation against two of our German subsidiaries.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	From time to time, like many other technology companies, we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights, copyrights, trademark rights or other intellectual property rights which such third parties believe may cover certain of our products, processes, technologies or information.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P37_S1	In the future, we may be a party to litigation to protect our intellectual property or as a result of an alleged infringement of others' intellectual property whether through direct claims or by way of indemnification claims of our customers, as, in some cases, we contractually agree to indemnify our customers against third-party infringement claims relating to our products.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P37_S2	These claims and any resulting lawsuit, if successful, could subject us to significant liability for damages or invalidation of our proprietary rights.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P37_S3	These lawsuits, regardless of their success, would likely be time-consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P37_S4	Any potential intellectual property litigation could also force us to do one or more of the following:
21510_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	redesign the products that use the technology.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P38_S1	If we are forced to take any of these actions or are otherwise a party to lawsuits of this nature, we may incur significant losses and our business may be seriously harmed.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P38_S2	We do not have insurance to cover potential claims of this type.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P38_S3	If our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Factors that may be considered in determining whether a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable include declines in our stock price and market capitalization or future cash flows projections.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P39_S3	A decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in market conditions, particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we used to calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units, could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an impairment charge.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P39_S4	Any such material charges, whether related to goodwill or purchased intangible assets, may have a material negative impact on our financial and operating results.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P39_S5	We depend on skilled personnel to operate our business effectively in a rapidly changing market, and if we are unable to retain existing or hire additional personnel when needed, our ability to develop and sell our products could be harmed.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P39_S6	Our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel will be a critical factor in determining whether we will be successful in the future.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Recruiting and retaining highly skilled personnel in certain functions continues to be difficult.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P40_S1	At certain locations where we operate, the cost of living is extremely high and it may be difficult to retain key employees and management at a reasonable cost.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P40_S2	We may not be successful in attracting, assimilating or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Our failure to attract additional employees and retain our existing employees could adversely affect our growth and our business.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and support personnel, any of whom may leave and our ability to effectively transition to their successors.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P40_S5	Our inability to retain or to effectively transition to their successors could harm our business and our results of operations.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P40_S6	The long sales cycles for our products may cause us to incur significant expenses without offsetting net sales.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P40_S7	Customers often view the purchase of our products as a significant and strategic decision.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P40_S8	As a result, customers typically expend significant effort in evaluating, testing and qualifying our products before making a decision to purchase them, resulting in a lengthy initial sales cycle.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P40_S9	While our customers are evaluating our products and before they place an order with us, we may incur substantial sales and marketing and research and development expenses to customize our products to the customers' needs.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P40_S10	We may also expend significant management efforts, increase manufacturing capacity and order long lead-time components or materials prior to receiving an order.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	As a result, these long sales cycles may cause us to incur significant expenses without ever receiving net sales to offset such expenses.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The markets in which we sell our products are intensely competitive and increased competition could cause reduced sales levels, reduced gross margins or the loss of market share.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Competition in the various photonics markets in which we provide products is very intense.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P42_S2	We compete against a number of large public and private companies, including CVI Melles Griot, Novanta Inc., IPG Photonics Corporation, Lumentum Holdings Inc., MKS Instruments, Inc. and Trumpf GmbH, as well as other smaller companies.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Some of our competitors are large companies that have significant financial, technical, marketing and other resources.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P42_S4	These competitors may be able to devote greater resources than we can to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P42_S5	Some of our competitors are much better positioned than we are to acquire other companies in order to gain new technologies or products that may displace our product lines.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P42_S6	Any of these acquisitions could give our competitors a strategic advantage.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P42_S7	Any business combinations or mergers among our competitors, forming larger companies with greater resources, could result in increased competition, price reductions, reduced margins or loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P42_S8	Additional competitors may enter the markets in which we serve, both foreign and domestic, and we are likely to compete with new companies in the future.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P42_S9	We may encounter potential customers that, due to existing relationships with our competitors, are committed to the products offered by these competitors.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P42_S10	Further, our current or potential customers may determine to develop and produce products for their own use which are competitive to our products.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P42_S11	As a result of the foregoing factors, we expect that competitive pressures may result in price reductions, reduced margins, loss of sales and loss of market share.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P42_S12	In addition, in markets where there are a limited number of customers, competition is particularly intense.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P42_S13	If we fail to accurately forecast component and material requirements for our products, we could incur additional costs and incur significant delays in shipments, which could result in a loss of customers.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P42_S14	We use rolling forecasts based on anticipated product orders and material requirements planning systems to determine our product requirements.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P42_S15	It is very important that we accurately predict both the demand for our products and the lead times required to obtain the necessary components and materials.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P42_S16	We depend on our suppliers for most of our product components and materials.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P42_S17	Lead times for components and materials that we order vary significantly and depend on factors including the specific supplier requirements, the size of the order, contract terms and current market demand for components.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P42_S18	For substantial increases in our sales levels of certain products, some of our suppliers may need at least nine months lead-time.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P42_S19	If we overestimate our component and material requirements, we may have excess inventory, which would increase our costs.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P42_S20	If we underestimate our component and material requirements, we may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt and delay delivery of our products to our customers.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P42_S21	Any of these occurrences would negatively impact our net sales, business or operating results.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P42_S22	Our reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing may adversely impact our financial results and operations due to our decreased control over the performance and timing of certain aspects of our manufacturing.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P42_S23	Our manufacturing strategy includes partnering with contract manufacturers to outsource non-core subassemblies and less complex turnkey products, including some performed at international sites located in Asia and Eastern Europe.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P42_S24	Our ability to resume internal manufacturing operations for certain products and components in a timely manner may be eliminated.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P42_S25	The cost, quality, performance and availability of contract manufacturing operations are and will be essential to the successful production and sale of many of our products.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P42_S26	Our financial condition or results of operation could be adversely impacted if any contract manufacturer or other supplier is unable for any reason, including as a result of the impact of worldwide economic conditions, to meet our cost, quality, performance, and availability standards.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P42_S27	We may not be able to provide contract manufacturers with product volumes that are high enough to achieve sufficient cost savings.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P42_S28	If shipments fall below forecasted levels, we may incur increased costs or be required to take ownership of the inventory.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P42_S29	Also, our ability to control the quality of products produced by contract manufacturers may be limited and quality issues may not be resolved in a timely manner, which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P42_S30	If we fail to effectively manage our growth or, alternatively, our spending during downturns, our business could be disrupted, which could harm our operating results.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P42_S31	Growth in sales, combined with the challenges of managing geographically dispersed operations, can place a significant strain on our management systems and resources, and our anticipated growth in future operations could continue to place such a strain.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P42_S32	The failure to effectively manage our growth could disrupt our business and harm our operating results.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P42_S33	Our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in evolving markets requires an effective planning and management process.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	competitive position during the downturn, as well as our future opportunities when the economy improves, remain intact.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P43_S1	The failure to effectively manage our spending and operations could disrupt our business and harm our operating results.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Historically, acquisitions have been an important element of our strategy.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P44_S1	However, we may not find suitable acquisition candidates in the future and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Any acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P44_S3	We have in the past made strategic acquisitions of other corporations and entities, including Rofin in November 2016, as well as asset purchases, and we continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions of complementary companies, products and technologies.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P44_S4	In the event of any future acquisitions, we could:
21510_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	incur expenses related to impairment of goodwill and amortization.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Acquisitions also involve numerous risks, including:
21510_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	the failure to complete acquisitions even after signing definitive agreements which, among other things, would result in the expensing of potentially significant professional fees and other charges in the period in which the acquisition or negotiations are terminated.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P46_S1	We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify appropriate acquisition candidates, to integrate any businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future or achieve the anticipated benefits of such transactions, which may harm our business.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Our market is unpredictable and characterized by rapid technological changes and evolving standards demanding a significant investment in research and development, and, if we fail to address changing market conditions, our business and operating results will be harmed.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The photonics industry is characterized by extensive research and development, rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Because this industry is subject to rapid change, it is difficult to predict its potential size or future growth rate.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Our success in generating net sales in this industry will depend on, among other things:
21510_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	our ability to accurately predict and develop our products to meet industry standards.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P48_S1	For our fiscal years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , our research and development costs were $81.8 million ( 9.5% of net sales), $81.5 million ( 10.2% of net sales) and $79.1 million ( 10.0% of net sales), respectively.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	expenditures for research and development will result in the introduction of new products or, if such products are introduced, that those products will achieve sufficient market acceptance or to generate sales to offset the costs of development.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Our failure to address rapid technological changes in our markets could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P49_S2	We are exposed to lawsuits in the normal course of business which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P49_S3	We are exposed to lawsuits in the normal course of our business, including product liability claims, if personal injury, death or commercial losses occur from the use of our products.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P49_S4	While we typically maintain business insurance, including directors' and officers' policies, litigation can be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations, including the potential impact of indemnification obligations for individuals named in any such lawsuits.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P49_S5	We may not, however, be able to secure insurance coverage on terms acceptable to us in the future.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P49_S6	Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P49_S7	An unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit, including a recall or redesign of products if ultimately determined to be defective, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P49_S8	We use standard laboratory and manufacturing materials that could be considered hazardous and we could be liable for any damage or liability resulting from accidental environmental contamination or injury.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P49_S9	Although most of our products do not incorporate hazardous or toxic materials and chemicals, some of the gases used in our excimer lasers and some of the liquid dyes used in some of our scientific laser products are highly toxic.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P49_S10	In addition, our operations involve the use of standard laboratory and manufacturing materials that could be considered hazardous.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P49_S11	Also, if a facility fire were to occur at our Sunnyvale, California site and were to spread to a reactor used to grow semiconductor wafers, it could release highly toxic emissions.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P49_S12	We believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with all federal, state and offshore regulations and standards.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P49_S13	However, the risk of accidental environmental contamination or injury from such materials cannot be entirely eliminated.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P49_S14	In the event of such an accident involving such materials, we could be liable for damages and such liability could exceed the amount of our liability insurance coverage and the resources of our business which could have an adverse effect on our financial results or our business as a whole.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P49_S15	Compliance or the failure to comply with current and future environmental regulations could cause us significant expense.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process or requiring design changes or recycling of products we manufacture.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P50_S1	If we fail to comply with any present and future regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities, the suspension of production or a prohibition on the sale of products we manufacture.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P50_S2	In addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment, or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations, including expenses associated with the recall of any non-compliant product and the management of historical waste.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P50_S3	From time to time new regulations are enacted, and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P50_S4	We continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P50_S5	These regulations include, for example, the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical substances ( REACH ), the Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive ( RoHS ) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive ( WEEE ) enacted in the European Union which regulate the use of certain hazardous substances in, and require the collection, reuse and recycling of waste from, certain products we manufacture.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P50_S6	This and similar legislation that has been or is in the process of being enacted in Japan, China, South Korea and various states of the United States may require us to re-design our products to ensure compliance with the applicable standards, for example by requiring the use of different types of materials.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P50_S7	These redesigns or alternative materials may detrimentally impact the performance of our products, add greater testing lead-times for product introductions or have other similar effects.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P50_S8	We believe we comply with all such legislation where our products are sold and we will continue to monitor these laws and the regulations being adopted under them to determine our responsibilities.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P50_S9	In addition, we are monitoring legislation relating to the reduction of carbon emissions from industrial operations to determine whether we may be required to incur any additional material costs or expenses associated with our operations.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P50_S10	We are not currently aware of any such material costs or expenses.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P51_S0	The SEC has promulgated rules requiring disclosure regarding the use of certain conflict minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and procedures regarding a manufacturer's efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P51_S1	The implementation of such rules has required us to incur additional expense and internal resources and may continue to do so in the future, particularly in the event that only a limited pool of suppliers are available to certify that products are free from conflict minerals.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Our failure to comply with any of the foregoing regulatory requirements or contractual obligations could result in our being directly or indirectly liable for costs, fines or penalties and third-party claims, and could jeopardize our ability to conduct business in the United States and foreign countries.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Our and our customers' operations would be seriously harmed if our logistics or facilities or those of our suppliers, our customers' suppliers or our contract manufacturers were to experience catastrophic loss.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Our operations, logistics and facilities and those of our customers, suppliers and contract manufacturers could be subject to a catastrophic loss from fire, flood, earthquake, volcanic eruption, work stoppages, power outages, acts of war, pandemic illnesses, energy shortages, theft of assets, other natural disasters or terrorist activity.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P53_S0	A substantial portion of our research and development activities, manufacturing, our corporate headquarters and other critical business operations are located near major earthquake faults in Santa Clara, California, an area with a history of seismic events.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Any such loss or detrimental impact to any of our operations, logistics or facilities could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and net sales and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P53_S2	While we have obtained insurance to cover most potential losses, after reviewing the costs and limitations associated with earthquake insurance, we have decided not to procure such insurance.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P53_S3	We believe that this decision is consistent with decisions reached by numerous other companies located nearby.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P53_S4	We cannot assure you that our existing insurance coverage will be adequate against all other possible losses.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P53_S5	Difficulties with our enterprise resource planning ( ERP ) system and other parts of our global information technology system could harm our business and results of operation.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P53_S6	If our network security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer's data or our data or our information technology systems, we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Like many modern multinational corporations, we maintain a global information technology system, including software products licensed from third parties.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Any system, network or Internet failures, misuse by system users, the hacking into or disruption caused by the unauthorized access by third parties or loss of license rights could disrupt our ability to timely and accurately manufacture and ship products or to report our financial information in compliance with the timelines mandated by the SEC.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Any such failure, misuse, hacking, disruptions or loss would likely cause a diversion of management's attention from the underlying business and could harm our operations.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P54_S3	In addition, a significant failure of our global information technology system could adversely affect our ability to complete an evaluation of our internal controls and attestation activities pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Our information systems are subject to attacks, interruptions and failures.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P55_S1	As part of our day-to-day business, we store our data and certain data about our customers in our global information technology system.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P55_S2	While our system is designed with access security, if a third party gains unauthorized access to our data, including any regarding our customers, such a security breach could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, loss of business, litigation and possible liability.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P55_S3	Our security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P55_S4	Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers' data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P55_S5	Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P55_S6	Any unauthorized access could result in a loss of confidence by our customers, damage our reputation, disrupt our business, lead to legal liability and negatively impact our future sales.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P55_S7	Additionally, such actions could result in significant costs associated with loss of our intellectual property, impairment of our ability to conduct our operations, rebuilding our network and systems, prosecuting and defending litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages or taking other remedial steps.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P55_S8	Changes in tax rates, tax liabilities or tax accounting rules could affect future results.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P56_S0	As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries and jurisdictions.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Significant judgment is required to determine our worldwide tax liabilities.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P56_S2	A number of factors may affect our future effective tax rates including, but not limited to:
21510_16_ITEM1A_P57_S0	the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P57_S1	We are also engaged in discussions with various tax authorities regarding the appropriate level of profitability for Coherent entities and this may result in changes to our worldwide tax liabilities.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P57_S2	In addition, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) and other tax authorities.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P58_S0	From time to time the United States, foreign and state governments make substantive changes to tax rules and the application of rules to companies, including various announcements from the United States government potentially impacting our ability to defer taxes on international earnings.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P58_S1	We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P58_S2	Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Federal securities laws, rules and regulations, as well as the rules and regulations of self-regulatory organizations such as NASDAQ and the NYSE, require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures, impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements, set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers, chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P60_S1	These laws, rules and regulations have increased and will continue to increase the scope, complexity and cost of our corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices, which could harm our results of operations and divert management's attention from business operations.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P61_S1	New or changed laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P61_S2	As a result, their application in practice may evolve over time.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We are committed to maintaining high standards of ethics, corporate governance and public disclosure.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Complying with evolving interpretations of new or changed legal requirements may cause us to incur higher costs as we revise current practices, policies and procedures, and may divert management time and attention from revenue generating to compliance activities.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P62_S2	If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, our reputation may also be harmed.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P62_S3	Governmental regulations, including duties, affecting the import or export of products could negatively affect our net sales.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P63_S0	The United States and many foreign governments impose tariffs and duties on the import and export of products, including some of those which we sell.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P63_S1	In particular, given our worldwide operations, we pay duties on certain products when they are imported into the United States for repair work as well as on certain of our products which are manufactured by our foreign subsidiaries.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P63_S2	These products can be subject to a duty on the product value.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P63_S3	Additionally, the United States and various foreign governments have imposed tariffs, controls, export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies, especially encryption technology.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P63_S4	From time to time, government agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology, such as requiring the escrow and governmental recovery of private encryption keys.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P63_S5	Governmental regulation of encryption technology and regulation of imports or exports, or our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products, could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our net sales.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P63_S6	From time to time our duty calculations and payments are audited by government agencies.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Korea for customs duties and value-added-tax for the period March 2009 to March 2014.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P64_S1	We were liable for additional payments, duties, taxes and penalties of $1.6 million, which we paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2016.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Any future assessments could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P64_S3	In addition, compliance with the directives of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls ( DDTC ) may result in substantial expenses and diversion of management.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P64_S4	Any failure to adequately address the directives of DDTC could result in civil fines or suspension or loss of our export privileges, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P64_S5	Failure to maintain effective internal controls may cause a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements or to cause us to delay filing our periodic reports with the SEC and adversely affect our stock price.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P65_S0	The SEC, as directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on Form 10-K that contain an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P65_S1	In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P65_S2	Although we test our internal control over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with the Section 404 requirements, our failure to maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements or a delay in our ability to timely file our periodic reports with the SEC, which ultimately could negatively impact our stock price.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P65_S3	Provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law, and our Change-of-Control Severance Plan may have anti-takeover effects that could prevent or delay a change in control.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P65_S4	Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition or make removal of incumbent directors or officers more difficult.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P65_S5	These provisions may discourage takeover attempts and bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P66_S0	establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P67_S0	We are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a merger, asset or stock sale or other transaction with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date such person became an interested stockholder, unless prior approval of our board of directors is obtained or as otherwise provided.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P67_S1	These provisions of Delaware law also may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us without obtaining the prior approval of our board of directors, which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P68_S0	In addition, we have adopted a change of control severance plan, which provides for the payment of a cash severance benefit to each eligible employee based on the employee's position.
21510_16_ITEM1A_P68_S1	If a change of control occurs, our successor or acquirer will be required to assume and agree to perform all of our obligations under the change of control severance plan which may discourage potential acquirers or result in a lower stock price.

21510_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	(2) This facility is utilized primarily by our SLS operating segment.
21510_16_ITEM2_P0_S2	We currently plan to renew leases on buildings as they expire.
21510_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	We maintain other sales and service offices under varying leases expiring from 2017 through 2020 in Japan, China, Taiwan, France, Italy, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.
21510_16_ITEM2_P1_S1	We consider our facilities to be both suitable and adequate to provide for current and near term requirements and that the productive capacity in our facilities is substantially being utilized or we have plans to utilize it.
21510_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	The United States and many foreign governments impose tariffs and duties on the import and export of certain products we sell.
21510_16_ITEM3_P0_S1	From time to time our duty calculations and payments are audited by government agencies.
21510_16_ITEM3_P0_S2	During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we concluded an audit in South Korea for customs duties and value added tax for the period March 2009 to March 2014.
21510_16_ITEM3_P0_S3	We paid $1.6 million related to this matter in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and have no remaining accrual at October 1, 2016.
21510_16_ITEM3_P1_S0	Income Tax Audits We are subject to taxation and file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions.
21510_16_ITEM3_P1_S1	For U.S. federal income tax purposes, all years prior to fiscal 2011 are closed.
21510_16_ITEM3_P1_S2	The Company agreed to extend the statutes of limitations for its fiscal 2011 and 2012 U.S. federal tax returns to June 17, 2017 due to an ongoing Advanced Pricing Agreement ( APA ) between the U.S. and Korea.
21510_16_ITEM3_P2_S0	In March 2016, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued an audit notice and Information Documentation Requests (IDRs) for fiscal 2013.
21510_16_ITEM3_P2_S1	The audit is currently in progress and the statute of limitation was extended to December 31, 2017.
21510_16_ITEM3_P3_S0	In our major foreign jurisdictions and our major state jurisdictions, the years prior to fiscal 2011 and 2012, respectively, are closed to examination.
21510_16_ITEM3_P3_S1	Earlier years in our various jurisdictions may remain open for adjustment to the extent that we have tax attribute carryforwards from those years.
21510_16_ITEM3_P3_S2	In December 2011 and January 2012, three of our German subsidiaries received notices of tax audits for the fiscal years 2006 through 2010.
21510_16_ITEM3_P3_S3	The audits were completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2016.
21510_16_ITEM3_P3_S4	As a result of the settlement, our gross uncertain tax positions decreased by approximately $4.9 million.
21510_16_ITEM3_P3_S5	The net provision impact of the adjustments was immaterial to the consolidated statement of operations.
21510_16_ITEM3_P4_S0	In July 2015 and March 2016, Coherent Kaiserslautern GmbH (formerly Lumera Laser GmbH) received tax audit notices for the fiscal years 2010 to 2014.
21510_16_ITEM3_P4_S1	The audit began in August 2015.
21510_16_ITEM3_P4_S2	We acquired the shares of Lumera Laser GmbH in December 2012 and, pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement, we should not have responsibility for any assessments related to the pre-acquisition period.
21510_16_ITEM3_P5_S0	In June, 2016, Coherent Holding GmbH and Coherent Deutschland GmbH each received a tax audit notice for the fiscal years 2011 to 2014.
21510_16_ITEM3_P5_S1	The audit began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.
21510_16_ITEM3_P5_S2	Coherent GmbH, Coherent LaserSystems GmbH Co. KG and Coherent Germany GmbH received audit notices for the period that they were in existence during the fiscal years 2011 through 2014 and the audit work is scheduled to commence in January 2017.
21510_16_ITEM3_P5_S3	We regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions and management believes that it has adequately provided reserves for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.
21510_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	The number of stockholders of record as of November 28, 2016 was 746 .
21510_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	While we paid a cash dividend in fiscal 2013 and may elect to pay dividends in the future, we have no present intention to declare cash dividends.
21510_16_ITEM5_P1_S1	Our line of credit agreement, signed on November 7, 2016, includes certain restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends.

21510_16_ITEM6_P0_S0	We derived the consolidated statement of operations data for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of fiscal 2016 and 2015 year-end from our audited consolidated financial statements, and accompanying notes, contained in this annual report.
21510_16_ITEM6_P0_S1	The consolidated statements of operations data for fiscal 2013 and 2012 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 year-end are derived from our consolidated financial statements which are not included in this annual report.
21510_16_ITEM6_P1_S0	* In November 2015, the FASB issued amended guidance that clarifies that in a classified statement of financial position, an entity shall classify deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent amounts.
21510_16_ITEM6_P1_S1	The new guidance supersedes ASC 740-10-45-5 which required the valuation allowance for a particular tax jurisdiction be allocated between current and noncurrent deferred tax assets for that tax jurisdiction on a pro rata basis.
21510_16_ITEM6_P1_S2	We elected to early adopt the standard retrospectively in fiscal 2016, which resulted in the reclassification of current deferred income tax assets to non-current deferred income tax assets and non-current deferred income tax liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets for fiscal 2016 and 2015.
21510_16_ITEM6_P1_S3	The impact of the reclassifications to deferred tax assets and liabilities for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 was immaterial.
21510_16_ITEM6_P2_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ (1) Includes $6.4 million of after tax costs related to the acquisition of Rofin, a $1.4 million after-tax loss on our hedge of our foreign exchange risk related to the commitment of our term loan to finance the acquisition of Rofin, $0.8 million after-tax interest expense on the commitment of our term loan to finance the acquisition of Rofin and a benefit of $1.2 million from the renewal of the R D tax credit for fiscal 2015.
21510_16_ITEM6_P2_S1	(2) Includes a charge of $1.3 million after tax for the impairment of our investment in SiOnyx, a $1.3 million after-tax charge for an accrual related to an ongoing customs audit, a benefit of $1.1 million from the renewal of the R D tax credit for fiscal 2014 and $1.3 million gain on our purchase of Tinsley in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
21510_16_ITEM6_P2_S2	(3) Includes a tax benefit of $1.4 million from the renewal of the R D tax credit for fiscal 2012.
21510_16_ITEM6_P2_S3	(4) Includes a charge of $4.3 million after tax related to the write-off of previously acquired intangible assets and inventories, a $2.8 million tax benefit due to decreases in valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and a $1.6 million tax benefit related to the release of tax reserves and related interest as a result of the closure of open tax years.

21510_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS Below is a summary of some of the quantitative performance indicators (as defined below) that are evaluated by management to assess our financial performance.
21510_16_ITEM7_P0_S1	Some of the indicators are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered as an alternative to any other measure for determining operating performance that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
21510_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	Definitions and analysis of these performance indicators are as follows: Bookings and Book-to-Bill Ratio Bookings represent orders received during the current period for products and services.
21510_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	While we generally have not experienced a significant rate of cancellation, bookings are generally cancelable, depending on the notice period, by our customers without substantial penalty and, therefore, we cannot assure all bookings will be converted to net sales.
21510_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	The book-to-bill ratio is calculated as annual bookings divided by annual net sales.
21510_16_ITEM7_P2_S1	This is an indication of the strength of our business but can sometimes be impacted by a single large order or a single large shipment.
21510_16_ITEM7_P2_S2	A ratio greater than 1.0 indicates that demand for our products is greater than what we supply in the year whereas a ratio of less than 1.0 indicates that demand for our products is less than what we supply in the year.
21510_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	Fiscal 2016 bookings increased 85% from bookings in fiscal 2015 and our book-to-bill ratio increased from 0.95 in fiscal 2015 to 1.65 in fiscal 2016 .
21510_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	The bookings increase included increases in the microelectronics ( 170% ), materials processing ( 13% ) and OEM components and instrumentation ( 9% ) markets partially offset by decreases in the scientific ( 3% ) market.
21510_16_ITEM7_P3_S2	Although fiscal 2016 bookings increased, bookings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 decreased 36% from the third quarter of fiscal 2016 , with decreases in the microelectronics, materials processing and OEM components and instrumentation markets partially offset by increases in the scientific market.
21510_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	Fiscal 2015 bookings decreased 14% from bookings in fiscal 2014 and our book-to-bill ratio decreased from 1.12 in fiscal 2014 to 0.95 in fiscal 2015 .
21510_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	The bookings decrease included decreases in the microelectronics ( 19% ), OEM components and instrumentation ( 14% ), materials processing ( 8% ) and scientific ( 2% ) markets.
21510_16_ITEM7_P4_S2	Although fiscal 2015 bookings decreased, bookings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 increased 16% from the third quarter of fiscal 2015 , with increases in all four markets.
21510_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	Backlog represents orders which we expect to be shipped within 12 months and the current portion of service contracts.
21510_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	For a discussion of backlog, see "RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - BACKLOG".
21510_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	Although fiscal 2016 bookings increased 170% from bookings in fiscal 2015 and the book-to-bill ratio for the year was 2.17 , bookings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 decreased 48% from the third quarter of fiscal 2016 primarily due to decreased systems orders net of higher service orders for the flat panel display market.
21510_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	Flat panel display orders for fiscal 2016 increased 310% from orders in fiscal 2015 primarily due to the timing and mix of order placement by customers with orders received from multiple customers for large format Linebeam systems to be used in flexible organic light-emitting diode (OLED) production.
21510_16_ITEM7_P6_S2	Fourth quarter fiscal 2016 orders were 56% lower than those in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 primarily due to lower orders for Linebeam 1500 and 1000 systems, net of higher service bookings.
21510_16_ITEM7_P6_S3	We expect continued fluctuations in order volumes on a quarterly basis.
21510_16_ITEM7_P6_S4	After building significant flat panel display backlog during the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, in the fourth quarter system orders temporarily returned to a more modest level while flat panel display service orders and revenue were very strong.
21510_16_ITEM7_P6_S5	Some customers are adding capacity to take a larger share of the first wave of OLED adoption while others believe OLED will replace LCDs everywhere from handsets to mobile computing to TVs and signage.
21510_16_ITEM7_P6_S6	These customers are securing capacity to capitalize on these potential trends and, as a result, we have already booked $100 million of new orders in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, which together with our existing backlog fills out most of our existing fiscal 2018 capacity.
21510_16_ITEM7_P6_S7	Advanced packaging ("API") orders decreased 29% for the full fiscal year and fourth quarter fiscal 2016 orders decreased 12% from orders in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 .
21510_16_ITEM7_P6_S8	The API market continues to demonstrate variability based on project specific activity.
21510_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	There is an increased use of SiPs, or system in package, in the newest smartphones, which increases the number of interconnects and functionality in a smaller footprint.
21510_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	This will maintain pressure on the via drilling market in the next few quarters, but we believe the impact will be temporary since new applications like virtual reality need large amounts of processing power.
21510_16_ITEM7_P7_S2	Orders from semiconductor capital equipment OEMs increased 5% for fiscal 2016 and were 26% higher in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2016 due to increases in wafer inspection (investments for mobile logic chips) and ink jet nozzle printing applications.
21510_16_ITEM7_P7_S3	Service orders and shipments remain strong due to high utilization rates in most fabs.
21510_16_ITEM7_P7_S4	In addition, we saw favorable inventory corrections at certain customers that resulted in increased sales that we believe are sustainable.
21510_16_ITEM7_P7_S5	We do not anticipate any significant reduction in orders from the recent collapse of two proposed mergers in the semiconductor capital equipment market since they were largely complementary with respect to our ongoing business.
21510_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	OEM Components and Instrumentation Bookings in fiscal 2016 increased 9% from fiscal 2015 and the book-to-bill ratio for the year was 1.08 .
21510_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	However, orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 decreased 3% from orders in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 due to lower orders for medical applications.
21510_16_ITEM7_P8_S2	Instrumentation orders decreased 1% for the full fiscal year and fourth quarter fiscal 2016 orders increased 12% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2016 due to timing of orders.
21510_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	Demand is strong for all submarkets in bioinstrumentation.
21510_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	In flow cytometry, market adoption of the test protocols and the proliferation of desktop instruments from existing and new market entrants are fueling growth.
21510_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	Bookings for confocal microscopy were solid.
21510_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	Our efforts in high-speed gene sequencing are resulting in increasing orders as we secure more design wins.
21510_16_ITEM7_P10_S2	Orders for medical OEM products increased 13% for the full fiscal year 2016, but fourth quarter fiscal 2016 orders decreased 32% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2016.
21510_16_ITEM7_P10_S3	In spite of the decrease in orders, the medical OEM market remains strong.
21510_16_ITEM7_P10_S4	The medical OEM market is being affected by M A activity and reorganizations within existing customers, which is causing changes in demand, inventory practices and R D spending.
21510_16_ITEM7_P10_S5	From our historical experience, we believe these are mostly temporary factors.
21510_16_ITEM7_P10_S6	By contrast, the consumables business is robust, suggesting the number of procedures being performed is stable to increasing.
21510_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	Annual bookings increased 13% from fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016 's book-to-bill ratio was 1.05 .
21510_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	However, bookings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 decreased 26% from the prior quarter due to lower orders for metal cutting and engraving applications.
21510_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	Bookings volumes in our materials processing business can vary significantly from quarter to quarter.
21510_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	In spite of the decrease in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, it was a record year for orders and sales in our materials processing business.
21510_16_ITEM7_P12_S2	A number of applications contributed to our success including thin metal cutting in consumer electronics packaging and additive manufacturing as well as short pulse processing for the automotive, medical device and machine tool industries.
21510_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	Although fiscal 2016 orders decreased 3% from bookings in fiscal 2015 , the book-to-bill ratio for the year was 1.03 .
21510_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	Orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 increased 37% from the third quarter of fiscal 2016 as the U.S., Asian and European markets delivered a typically strong fourth quarter performance.
21510_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	Our Astrella ultrafast amplifier is the leading solution in the research marketplace based upon performance and unit volumes; bookings were particularly strong in China, where funding for applied physics and physical chemistry is similar to that in the U.S.
21510_16_ITEM7_P13_S3	The Chameleon Discovery , our most advanced light source for multiphoton imaging, had record unit and dollar bookings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.
21510_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	Net Sales Net sales include sales of lasers, laser tools, related accessories and service.
21510_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	Net sales for fiscal 2016 increased 7% from fiscal 2015 .
21510_16_ITEM7_P14_S2	Net sales for fiscal 2015 increased 1% from fiscal 2014 .
21510_16_ITEM7_P14_S3	For a description of the reasons for changes in net sales refer to the "Results of Operations" section below.
21510_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	Gross Profit as a Percentage of Net Sales Gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit percentage") is calculated as gross profit for the period divided by net sales for the period.
21510_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	Gross profit percentage for SLS increased to 48.3% in fiscal 2016 from 45.3% in fiscal 2015 and from 42.1% in fiscal 2014 .
21510_16_ITEM7_P15_S2	Gross profit percentage for CLC increased to 35.0% in fiscal 2016 from 34.9% in fiscal 2015 and from 33.9% in fiscal 2014 .
21510_16_ITEM7_P15_S3	For a description of the reasons for changes in gross profit refer to the "Results of Operations" section below.
21510_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	Research and Development as a Percentage of Net Sales Research and development as a percentage of net sales ("R D percentage") is calculated as research and development expense for the period divided by net sales for the period.
21510_16_ITEM7_P16_S1	Management considers R D percentage to be an important indicator in managing our business as investing in new technologies is a key to future growth.
21510_16_ITEM7_P16_S2	R D percentage decreased to 9.5% in fiscal 2016 from 10.2% in fiscal 2015 and 10.0% in fiscal 2014 .
21510_16_ITEM7_P16_S3	For a description of the reasons for changes in R D spending refer to the "Results of Operations" section below.
21510_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows primarily represents the excess of cash collected from billings to our customers and other receipts over cash paid to our vendors for expenses and inventory purchases to run our business.
21510_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	We believe that cash flows from operations are an important performance indicator because cash generation over the long term is essential to maintaining a healthy business and providing funds to help fuel growth.
21510_16_ITEM7_P17_S2	For a description of the reasons for changes in Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities refer to the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section below.
21510_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	Days Sales Outstanding in Receivables We calculate days sales outstanding ("DSO") in receivables as net receivables at the end of the period divided by net sales during the period and then multiplied by the number of days in the period, using 360 days for years.
21510_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	DSO in receivables indicates how well we are managing our collection of receivables, with lower DSO in receivables resulting in higher working capital availability.
21510_16_ITEM7_P18_S2	The more money we have tied up in receivables, the less money we have available for research and development, acquisitions, expansion, marketing and other activities to grow our business.
21510_16_ITEM7_P18_S3	Our DSO in receivables for fiscal 2016 increased to 69.6 days from 63.8 days in fiscal 2015 .
21510_16_ITEM7_P18_S4	The increase in DSO in receivables is primarily due to a higher concentration of receivables in Asia and Japan where DSOs are typically higher and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates partially offset by a lower concentration of sales in the last month of the fiscal year in all regions.
21510_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	Annualized Fourth Quarter Inventory Turns We calculate annualized fourth quarter inventory turns as cost of sales during the fourth quarter annualized and divided by net inventories at the end of the fourth quarter.
21510_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	This indicates how well we are managing our inventory levels, with higher inventory turns resulting in more working capital availability and a higher return on our investments in inventory.
21510_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	money we have tied up in inventory, the less money we have available for research and development, acquisitions, expansion, marketing and other activities to grow our business.
21510_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	Our annualized fourth quarter inventory turns for fiscal 2016 decreased to 2.5 turns from 3.0 turns in fiscal 2015 primarily due to the planned build-up of inventory levels in certain business units, primarily in microelectronics, to support increased demand for our large format Linebeam systems.
21510_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	Capital Spending as a Percentage of Net Sales Capital spending as a percentage of net sales ("capital spending percentage") is calculated as capital expenditures for the period divided by net sales for the period.
21510_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	Capital spending percentage indicates the extent to which we are expanding or improving our operations, including investments in technology and equipment.
21510_16_ITEM7_P21_S2	Management monitors capital spending levels as this assists us in measuring our cash flows, net of capital expenditures.
21510_16_ITEM7_P21_S3	Our capital spending percentage increased to 5.8% in fiscal 2016 from 2.8% in fiscal 2015 and 2.9% in fiscal 2014 .
21510_16_ITEM7_P21_S4	The fiscal 2016 increase was primarily due to increased investments to expand our manufacturing capacity in G ttingen, Germany, upgrade certain of our production facilities in California and New Jersey and higher purchases of production-related assets, partially offset by the impact of higher revenues in fiscal 2016.
21510_16_ITEM7_P21_S5	The fiscal 2015 decrease was primarily due to lower purchases of production-related assets.
21510_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	We define adjusted EBITDA as operating income adjusted for depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, major restructuring costs and certain other non-operating income and expense items, such as costs related to the acquisition of Rofin.
21510_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	Key initiatives to reach our goals for EBITDA improvements include utilization of our Asian manufacturing locations, rationalizing our supply chain and continued leveraging of our infrastructure.
21510_16_ITEM7_P22_S2	We utilize a number of different financial measures, both GAAP and non-GAAP, such as adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales, in analyzing and assessing our overall business performance, for making operating decisions and for forecasting and planning future periods.
21510_16_ITEM7_P22_S3	We consider the use of non-GAAP financial measures helpful in assessing our current financial performance and ongoing operations.
21510_16_ITEM7_P22_S4	While we use non-GAAP financial measures as a tool to enhance our understanding of certain aspects of our financial performance, we do not consider these measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial measures.
21510_16_ITEM7_P22_S5	We provide adjusted EBITDA in order to enhance investors' understanding of our ongoing operations.
21510_16_ITEM7_P22_S6	This measure is used by some investors when assessing our performance.
21510_16_ITEM7_P22_S7	Below is the reconciliation of our net income as a percentage of net sales to our adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales:
21510_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	SIGNIFICANT EVENTS Acquisitions and related financing On November 7, 2016 , we completed our previously announced acquisition of Rofin pursuant to the Merger Agreement dated March 16, 2016.
21510_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	Rofin is one of the world's leading developers and manufacturers of high-performance industrial laser sources and laser-based solutions and components.
21510_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	As a condition of the acquisition, we are required to divest ourselves of Rofin s low power CO2 laser business based in Hull, United Kingdom, and will report this business separately as a discontinued operation until it is divested.
21510_16_ITEM7_P24_S2	The acquisition was an all-cash transaction at a price of $32.50 per share of Rofin common stock.
21510_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	excluding related transaction fees and expenses.
21510_16_ITEM7_P25_S1	We also paid $15.3 million due to the cancellation of options held by employees of Rofin.
21510_16_ITEM7_P25_S2	We funded the payment of the aggregate consideration with a combination of our available cash on hand and the proceeds from the Euro Term Loan described below.
21510_16_ITEM7_P25_S3	See Note 16, "Subsequent Events" in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of this annual report for further discussion of the acquisition.
21510_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	On November 7, 2016, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement ) with Barclays Bank PLC ("Barclays"), Bank of America, N.A. ("BAML") and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. ("MUFG").
21510_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	The Credit Agreement provided for a 670.0 million Euro senior secured term loan facility (the Euro Term Loan ) and a $100.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility.
21510_16_ITEM7_P26_S2	On November 7, 2016, the Euro Term Loan was drawn in full and its proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of Rofin and pay related fees and expenses.
21510_16_ITEM7_P26_S3	Also, on November 7, 2016, we used 10.0 million Euro of the capacity under the revolving credit facility for the issuance of a letter of credit.
21510_16_ITEM7_P26_S4	See Note 16, "Subsequent Events" in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of this annual report for further discussion of the Credit Agreement.
21510_16_ITEM7_P26_S5	In relation to the acquisition of Rofin, we paid Barclays, our financial advisor, a fee of approximately $9.5 million , $1.0 million of which was paid upon delivery of the fairness opinion in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, and was recorded in the selling, general and administrative line of the consolidated statements of operations, and the remaining portion of which was paid upon consummation of the acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
21510_16_ITEM7_P26_S6	We also paid Barclays, BAML and MUFG together approximately $17.0 million and $5.6 million for underwriting and upfront fees, respectively, upon the close of the financing on November 7, 2016.
21510_16_ITEM7_P26_S7	See Note 16, "Subsequent Events" in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of this annual report for further discussion of the completion of the acquisition and issuance of the financing.
21510_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	On July 24, 2015, we acquired certain assets of Raydiance, Inc. ("Raydiance") for approximately $5.0 million, excluding transaction costs.
21510_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	Raydiance manufactured complete tools and lasers for ultrafast processing systems and subsystems in the precision micromachining processing market.

21510_16_ITEM7_P28_S2	On July 27, 2015, we acquired the assets and certain liabilities of the Tinsley Optics ("Tinsley") business from L-3 Communications Corporation for approximately $4.3 million, excluding transaction costs.
21510_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	Tinsley is a specialized manufacturer of high precision optical components and subsystems sold primarily in the aerospace and defense industry.
21510_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	Tinsley manufactures the large form factor optics for our excimer laser annealing systems.
21510_16_ITEM7_P29_S2	The Tinsley assets have been included in our Specialty Lasers and Systems segment.
21510_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	On June 8, 2010, we invested $2.0 million in SiOnyx, Inc., a privately-held company.
21510_16_ITEM7_P30_S1	The investment was included in other assets and was being carried on a cost basis.
21510_16_ITEM7_P30_S2	During the third quarter of fiscal 2015 we determined that our investment became other-than temporarily impaired.
21510_16_ITEM7_P30_S3	As a result, we recorded a non-cash charge of $2.0 million to operating expense in our results of operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.
21510_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	Stock Repurchases On August 25, 2015 , our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to $25.0 million of our outstanding common stock from time to time through August 31, 2016 .

21510_16_ITEM7_P46_S4	On a segment basis, SLS segment expenses decreased $1.7 million primarily due to lower variable spending.
21510_16_ITEM7_P46_S5	CLC spending decreased $1.2 million primarily due to lower variable spending.
21510_16_ITEM7_P46_S6	Spending for Corporate and other decreased $1.3 million primarily due to lower charges for increases in deferred compensation plan liabilities and lower stock-based compensation expense partially offset by higher variable spending including $1.3 million of legal and consulting costs related to acquisitions and higher payroll spending.
21510_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	Gain on business combination On July 27, 2015, we acquired the assets and certain liabilities of the Tinsley business from L-3 Communications Corporation for approximately $4.3 million , excluding transaction costs (See Note 3).
21510_16_ITEM7_P47_S1	The purchase price was lower than the fair value of net assets purchased, resulting in a gain of $1.3 million recorded in our consolidated statements of operations for our fiscal year 2015.
21510_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	Impairment of investment On June 8, 2010, we invested $2.0 million in SiOnyx, Inc., a privately-held company.
21510_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	The investment was included in other assets and was being carried on a cost basis.
21510_16_ITEM7_P48_S2	During the third quarter of fiscal 2015 we determined that our investment became other-than temporarily impaired.
21510_16_ITEM7_P48_S3	As a result, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $2.0 million to operating expense in our results of operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.
21510_16_ITEM7_P48_S4	Amortization of intangible assets Amortization of intangible assets increased $0.2 million , or 6% , from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 primarily due to increases due to the write-off of IPR D of $0.4 million related to our acquisition of Innolight and due to the asset acquisition from Raydiance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 partially offset by the completion of amortization of certain intangibles from prior acquisitions.
21510_16_ITEM7_P48_S5	Amortization of intangible assets decreased $0.8 million, or 22%, from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the completion of amortization of certain intangibles from prior acquisitions partially offset by amortization due to the asset acquisition from Raydiance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.

21510_16_ITEM7_P48_S7	The higher expenses were primarily due to higher net foreign exchange losses ($4.9 million) and $1.3 million higher interest expense primarily for the commitment of our term loan to finance the acquisition of Rofin partially offset by $2.1 million higher gains, net of expenses, on our deferred compensation plan assets and $0.5 million higher interest income due to higher balances of cash and short-term investments.
21510_16_ITEM7_P48_S8	The higher foreign exchange losses were primarily due to (1) higher unhedged exposure in fiscal 2016, (2) a loss of $2.2 million on our hedge of our foreign exchange risk related to the commitment of our term loan to finance the acquisition of Rofin, (3) the significant movement of rates in June 2016 due to the Brexit vote and (4) higher forward points on our hedging contracts.
21510_16_ITEM7_P48_S9	Other income (expense), net, changed by $3.5 million from other income of $2.4 million in fiscal 2014 to other expense of $1.2 million in fiscal 2015.
21510_16_ITEM7_P48_S10	The decrease was primarily due to $4.6 million lower gains, net of expenses, on our deferred compensation plan assets partially offset by lower net foreign currency exchange losses ($0.9 million) and $0.2 million higher interest income due to higher balances of cash and short-term investments.
21510_16_ITEM7_P48_S11	Net foreign currency exchange losses decreased due to higher unhedged exposure in fiscal 2014 and the significant movement of the Japanese Yen versus the Euro in the last month of the first quarter of fiscal 2014.
21510_16_ITEM7_P48_S12	In addition, favorable changes in foreign exchange rates in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 compared to the timing of hedge contracts were partially offset by an unfavorable impact in fiscal 2015 due to the weakening of certain Asian currencies against the U.S. Dollar.
21510_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	The effective tax rate on income before income taxes for fiscal 2016 of 28.8% was lower than the statutory rate of 35.0%.
21510_16_ITEM7_P49_S1	This was primarily due to differences related to the benefit of income subject to foreign tax rates that are lower than U.S. tax rates including the Singapore tax exemption, the benefit of foreign tax credits and the benefit of federal research and development tax credits including renewal of the federal research and development tax credits for fiscal 2015.
21510_16_ITEM7_P49_S2	These amounts are partially offset by deemed dividend inclusions under the Subpart F tax rules, stock-based compensation not deductible for tax purposes and limitations on the deductibility of compensation under IRC Section 162(m).
21510_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	The effective tax rate on income before income taxes for fiscal 2015 of 23.3% was lower than the statutory rate of 35.0%.
21510_16_ITEM7_P50_S1	This was primarily due to differences related to the benefit of income subject to foreign tax rates that are lower than U.S. tax rates including South Korea and Singapore tax exemptions, the benefit of foreign tax credits and the benefit of federal research and development tax credits including renewal of the federal research and development tax credits for fiscal 2014.
21510_16_ITEM7_P50_S2	These amounts are partially offset by deemed dividend inclusions under the Subpart F tax rules, stock-based compensation not deductible for tax purposes and limitations on the deductibility of compensation under IRC Section 162(m).
21510_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	The effective tax rate on income before income taxes for fiscal 2014 of 25.4% was lower than the statutory rate of 35.0%.
21510_16_ITEM7_P51_S1	This was primarily due to differences related to the benefit of income subject to foreign tax rates that are lower than U.S. tax rates including South Korea and Singapore tax exemptions and the benefit of foreign tax credits.
21510_16_ITEM7_P51_S2	These amounts are partially offset by deemed dividend inclusions under the Subpart F tax rules, stock-based compensation not deductible for tax purposes and limitations on the deductibility of compensation under IRC Section 162(m).
21510_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	During fiscal 2016, we increased our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by $2.1 million to $17.6 million primarily due to the increase in California and other states research and development tax credits which are not expected to be recognized.
21510_16_ITEM7_P52_S1	During fiscal 2015, we increased our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by $1.2 million to $15.6 million primarily due to the reduced ability to utilize California and other states research and development tax credits.
21510_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	In making the determination to record the valuation allowance, management considered the likelihood of future taxable income and feasible and prudent tax planning strategies to realize deferred tax assets.
21510_16_ITEM7_P53_S1	In the future, if we determine that we expect to realize deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the valuation allowance will affect income in the period such determination is made.
21510_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	In October 2016, Coherent Singapore received an amended Pioneer Status tax exemption from the Singapore authorities effective from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2021.
21510_16_ITEM7_P54_S1	The tax holiday continues to be conditional upon our meeting certain revenue, business spending and employment thresholds.
21510_16_ITEM7_P54_S2	The impact of this tax exemption decreased Singapore income taxes by approximately $0.7 million in fiscal 2016.
21510_16_ITEM7_P54_S3	There are no tax benefits for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 due to the utilization of net operating loss.
21510_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity and capital resources At October 1, 2016 , we had assets classified as cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, in an aggregate amount of $400.0 million , compared to $325.5 million at October 3, 2015 .
21510_16_ITEM7_P55_S1	At October 1, 2016 , approximately $331.0 million of this cash and securities was held in certain of our foreign subsidiaries, $93.1 million of which was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
21510_16_ITEM7_P55_S2	At October 1, 2016 , we had approximately $313.8 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries where we intend to permanently reinvest our accumulated earnings in these entities and our current plans do not demonstrate a need for these funds to support our domestic operations.
21510_16_ITEM7_P55_S3	If, however, a portion of these funds are needed for and distributed to our operations in the United States, we may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes.
21510_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	An exception to U.S. taxation may be the repatriation of foreign funds that had been previously taxed in the U.S. as Subpart F income.
21510_16_ITEM7_P56_S1	The amount of the U.S. and foreign taxes due would depend on the amount and manner of repatriation, as well as the location from where the funds are repatriated.
21510_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	We actively monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold these assets, primarily focusing on the safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield on these assets.
21510_16_ITEM7_P57_S1	We diversify our cash and cash equivalents and investments among various financial institutions, money market funds, sovereign debt and other securities in order to reduce our exposure should any one of these financial institutions or financial instruments fail or encounter difficulties.
21510_16_ITEM7_P57_S2	To date, we have not experienced any material loss or lack of access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments.
21510_16_ITEM7_P57_S3	However, we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets.
21510_16_ITEM7_P57_S4	In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we spent a significant portion of our foreign funds on the Rofin acquisition.
21510_16_ITEM7_P57_S5	We did not repatriate foreign funds to our domestic operations to fund this acquisition.
21510_16_ITEM7_P57_S6	We expect to have adequate foreign funds in the future to service the acquisition debt and do not anticipate any repatriation of foreign funds to operate our domestic business.
21510_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar.
21510_16_ITEM7_P58_S1	At October 1, 2016 , this subsidiary had $226.8 million of U.S. dollar denominated investments primarily in money market funds and commercial paper.
21510_16_ITEM7_P58_S2	Accordingly, there is no translation expense arising from this entity holding U.S. dollar denominated investments.
21510_16_ITEM7_P58_S3	The converted funds are not intended to be repatriated to the U.S. and no U.S. tax was triggered on the transfer of these funds to the European subsidiary.
21510_16_ITEM7_P58_S4	See ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK below for more information about risks and trends related to foreign currencies.
21510_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	Sources and Uses of Cash Historically, our primary source of cash has been provided by operations.
21510_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	Other sources of cash in the past three fiscal years include proceeds received from the sale of our stock through our employee stock purchase plan as well as borrowings under our domestic line of credit.
21510_16_ITEM7_P59_S2	Our historical uses of cash have primarily been for the repurchase of our common stock, capital expenditures and acquisitions of businesses and technologies.
21510_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $19.2 million in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 and increased by $33.1 million in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 .
21510_16_ITEM7_P60_S1	The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to lower cash flows from the timing of shipments of large systems from inventory and lower cash flows from accounts receivable partially offset by higher net income and higher accrued payroll and accounts payable balances.
21510_16_ITEM7_P60_S2	The increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to higher net income and higher cash flows from the timing of shipments of large systems from inventory partially offset by lower cash flows from prepaid income taxes and accounts receivable.
21510_16_ITEM7_P60_S3	We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short term investments combined with cash to be provided by operating activities, amounts available under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to cover our working capital needs and planned capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months to the extent such items are known or are reasonably determinable based on current business and market conditions.
21510_16_ITEM7_P60_S4	However, we may elect to finance certain of our capital expenditure requirements through other sources of capital.
21510_16_ITEM7_P60_S5	We continue to follow our strategy to further strengthen our financial position by using available cash flow to fund operations.
21510_16_ITEM7_P60_S6	We intend to continue pursuing acquisition opportunities at valuations we believe are reasonable based upon market conditions.
21510_16_ITEM7_P60_S7	However, we cannot accurately predict the timing, size and success of our acquisition efforts or our associated potential capital commitments.
21510_16_ITEM7_P60_S8	Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire businesses on terms acceptable to us.
21510_16_ITEM7_P60_S9	We expect to fund future acquisitions through additional borrowings (as in our acquisition of Rofin), existing cash balances and cash flows from operations.
21510_16_ITEM7_P60_S10	If required, we will consider the issuance of securities.
21510_16_ITEM7_P60_S11	The extent to which we will be willing or able to use our common stock to make acquisitions will depend on its market value at the time and the willingness of potential sellers to accept it as full or partial payment.
21510_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	On November 7, 2016, we entered into a Credit Agreement by and among us, Coherent Holding GmbH, as borrower (the Borrower ), and certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries from time to time party thereto, as guarantors, the lenders from time to time party thereto, Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent and L/C Issuer, Bank of America, N.A., as L/C Issuer, and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., as L/C Issuer.
21510_16_ITEM7_P61_S1	The Credit Agreement provided for a 670.0 million Euro senior secured term loan facility (the Euro Term Loan ) and a $100.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility ( Revolving Credit Facility ) with a $30.0 million letter of credit sublimit and $10.0 million swing line sublimit.
21510_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	We may increase the aggregate revolving commitments or borrow incremental term loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $150.0 million, subject to certain conditions, including obtaining additional commitments from the lenders then party to the Credit Agreement or new lenders.
21510_16_ITEM7_P62_S1	On November 7, 2016, we borrowed the full 670.0 million Euro under the Euro Term Loan and its proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of Rofin and pay related fees and expenses.
21510_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	remainder of the Revolving Credit Facility is available.
21510_16_ITEM7_P63_S1	We expect to use future loans under the Revolving Credit Facility, if any, for general corporate purposes.
21510_16_ITEM7_P63_S2	The Credit Agreement replaces our existing $50.0 million Credit Agreement with Union Bank of California.
21510_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Borrower s option, at a rate equal to either (i) the London interbank offered rate (the Eurocurrency Rate ) or (ii) a base rate (the Base Rate ) equal to the highest of (x) the federal funds rate, plus 0.50%, (y) the prime rate then in effect and (z) the Eurocurrency Rate for loans denominated in U.S. dollars applicable to a one-month interest period, plus 1.0%, in each case, plus an applicable margin.
21510_16_ITEM7_P64_S1	The applicable margin for term loans borrowed as Eurocurrency Rate loans, is 3.50% initially, and following the first anniversary of the Closing Date ranges from 3.00% to 3.50% depending on the consolidated total gross leverage ratio at the time of determination.
21510_16_ITEM7_P64_S2	For term loans borrowed as Base Rate Loans, the applicable margin initially is 2.50%, and following the first anniversary of the Closing Date ranges from 2.00% to 2.50% depending upon the consolidated total gross leverage ratio at the time of determination.
21510_16_ITEM7_P64_S3	The applicable margin for revolving loans borrowed as Eurocurrency Rate Loans, ranges from 3.75% to 4.25%, and for revolving loans borrowed as Base Rate Loans, ranges from 2.75% to 3.25%, in each case, based on the consolidated total gross leverage ratio at the time of determination.
21510_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	Interest on Base Rate Loans is payable quarterly in arrears.
21510_16_ITEM7_P65_S1	Interest on Eurocurrency Rate Loans is payable at the end of the applicable interest period.
21510_16_ITEM7_P65_S2	Interest periods for Eurocurrency Rate loans may be, at the Borrower s option, one, two, three or six months.
21510_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	The Credit Agreement requires the Borrower to make scheduled quarterly payments on the Euro Term Loan of 0.25% of the original principal amount of the Euro Term Loan, with any remaining principal payable at maturity.
21510_16_ITEM7_P66_S1	A commitment fee accrues on any unused portion of the revolving loan commitments under the Credit Agreement at a rate of 0.375% or 0.5% depending on the consolidated total gross leverage ratio at any time of determination.
21510_16_ITEM7_P66_S2	The Borrower is also obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type.
21510_16_ITEM7_P66_S3	The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, including covenants regarding the payment of taxes and other obligations, maintenance of insurance, reporting requirements and compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and negative covenants, including covenants limiting the ability of us and our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur debt, grant liens, make investments, make certain restricted payments, transact with affiliates, and sell assets.
21510_16_ITEM7_P66_S4	The Credit Agreement also requires us and our subsidiaries to maintain a senior secured net leverage ratio as of the last day of each fiscal quarter of less of than or equal to 3.50 to 1.00.
21510_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default that include, among other things, payment defaults, cross defaults with certain other indebtedness, violation of covenants, inaccuracy of representations and warranties in any material respect, change in control of us and the Borrower, judgment defaults, and bankruptcy and insolvency events.
21510_16_ITEM7_P67_S1	If an event of default exists, the lenders may require the immediate payment of all Obligations, as defined in the Credit Agreement, and may exercise certain other rights and remedies provided for under the Credit Agreement, the other loan documents and applicable law.
21510_16_ITEM7_P67_S2	The acceleration of such obligations is automatic upon the occurrence of a bankruptcy and insolvency event of default.
21510_16_ITEM7_P67_S3	The aggregate consideration paid by us to the former Rofin stockholders was approximately $904.5 million, excluding related transaction fees and expenses.
21510_16_ITEM7_P67_S4	We also paid $15.3 million due to the cancellation of options held by employees of Rofin.
21510_16_ITEM7_P67_S5	We paid $5.2 million of debt issuance costs in fiscal 2016 and expect to pay approximately $25.0 million to $30.0 million of debt issuance costs in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
21510_16_ITEM7_P67_S6	In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, and the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we recorded an interest charge of $1.1 million and $2.7 million , respectively, in other income (expense) in our consolidated statement of operations related to the debt financing commitment.
21510_16_ITEM7_P67_S7	In relation to the acquisition of Rofin, we paid Barclays, our financial advisor, a fee of approximately $9.5 million , $1.0 million of which was paid upon delivery of the fairness opinion in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, and was recorded as SG A expense, and the remaining portion of which was paid upon consummation of the acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
21510_16_ITEM7_P67_S8	Additional sources of cash available to us were domestic and international currency lines of credit and bank credit facilities totaling $63.2 million as of October 1, 2016 , of which $40.5 million was unused and available.
21510_16_ITEM7_P67_S9	These unsecured international credit facilities were used in Europe and Japan during fiscal 2016 .
21510_16_ITEM7_P67_S10	As of October 1, 2016 , we had utilized $1.6 million of the international credit facilities as guarantees.
21510_16_ITEM7_P67_S11	Our domestic line of credit consisted of a $50.0 million unsecured revolving credit account, under which we had drawn $20.0 million and used $1.1 million for letters of credit as of October 1, 2016 .
21510_16_ITEM7_P67_S12	On November 4, 2016, we repaid the outstanding balance, plus accrued interest, on our domestic line of credit and terminated the credit facility.
21510_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	In fiscal 2015, under plans authorized by the Board of Directors, we repurchased and retired 1,302,323 shares of outstanding common stock at an average price of $57.59 per share for a total of $75.0 million .
21510_16_ITEM7_P68_S1	Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 4.0 :1 at October 1, 2016 , compared to 5.3 :1 at October 3, 2015 .
21510_16_ITEM7_P68_S2	The decrease in our ratio is primarily due to increases in other current liabilities, short-term borrowings, taxes payable and accounts payable partially offset by increases in cash and short-term investments, inventories, accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other assets.
21510_16_ITEM7_P68_S3	Our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and working capital are as follows (in thousands):
21510_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933.
21510_16_ITEM7_P69_S1	The following summarizes our contractual obligations at October 1, 2016 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):
21510_16_ITEM7_P70_S0	Because of the uncertainty as to the timing of such payments, we have excluded cash payments related to our contractual obligations for our deferred compensation plans aggregating $30.0 million at October 1, 2016 .
21510_16_ITEM7_P70_S1	As of October 1, 2016 , we recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $20.6 million including gross interest and penalties of $0.2 million .
21510_16_ITEM7_P70_S2	As of October 3, 2015 , we recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $24.3 million including gross interest and penalties of $1.8 million .
21510_16_ITEM7_P70_S3	Both gross unrecognized tax benefits and gross interest and penalties are classified as non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
21510_16_ITEM7_P71_S0	At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.
21510_16_ITEM7_P71_S1	As a result, these amounts are not included in the table above.
21510_16_ITEM7_P71_S2	Changes in financial condition Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016 was $105.3 million , which included net income of $87.5 million , depreciation and amortization of $34.4 million , stock-based compensation expense of $20.2 million and $0.9 million other, partially offset by cash used by operating assets and liabilities of $27.9 million (primarily increases in inventories net of increases in accrued payroll and deferred income) and increases in net deferred tax assets of $9.8 million .
21510_16_ITEM7_P71_S3	Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015 was $124.5 million, which included net income of $76.4 million, depreciation and amortization of $33.1 million, stock-based compensation expense of $18.2 million, the impairment of our investment in SiOnyx of $2.0 million, decreases in net deferred tax assets of $0.8 million and $0.6 million other, partially offset by cash used by operating assets and liabilities of $5.3 million and the net effect of the gain from acquisition of Tinsley asset of $1.3 million.
21510_16_ITEM7_P71_S4	Cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2016 of $103.4 million included $152.2 million net sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities partially offset by $48.8 million , net, used to acquire property and equipment, purchase and upgrade buildings, net of proceeds from dispositions.
21510_16_ITEM7_P71_S5	Cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2015 of $3.2 million included $33.5 million net sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities partially offset by $21.0 million, net, used to acquire property and equipment and improve buildings net of proceeds from dispositions and $9.3 million used to acquire Tinsley and Raydiance assets.
21510_16_ITEM7_P71_S6	Cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2016 was $17.2 million , which included $20.0 million net borrowings, and $7.8 million generated from our employee stock option and purchase plans partially offset by $5.4 million outflows due to net settlement of restricted stock and $5.2 million of debt issuance costs.
21510_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	million, which included $75.0 million repurchases of common stock and $5.3 million outflows due to net settlement of restricted stock partially offset by $7.3 million generated from our employee stock option and purchase plans.
21510_16_ITEM7_P73_S0	Changes in exchange rates in fiscal 2016 resulted in a decrease in cash balances of $2.2 million .
21510_16_ITEM7_P73_S1	Changes in exchange rates in fiscal 2015 resulted in a decrease in cash balances of $15.2 million.
21510_16_ITEM7_P74_S0	RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 2.
21510_16_ITEM7_P74_S1	"Significant Accounting Policies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the respective dates of adoption or expected adoption and effects on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
21510_16_ITEM7_P75_S0	APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.
21510_16_ITEM7_P75_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
21510_16_ITEM7_P75_S2	We have identified the following as the items that require the most significant judgment and often involve complex estimation: revenue recognition, accounting for long-lived assets (including goodwill and intangible assets), inventory valuation, warranty reserves, stock-based compensation and accounting for income taxes.
21510_16_ITEM7_P76_S0	We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered or the service has been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable.
21510_16_ITEM7_P76_S1	Revenue from product sales is recorded when all of the foregoing conditions are met and risk of loss and title passes to the customer.
21510_16_ITEM7_P76_S2	Our products typically include a warranty and the estimated cost of product warranty claims (based on historical experience) is recorded at the time the sale is recognized.
21510_16_ITEM7_P76_S3	Sales to customers are generally not subject to any price protection or return rights.
21510_16_ITEM7_P77_S0	The majority of our sales are made to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), distributors, representatives and end-users in the non-scientific market.
21510_16_ITEM7_P77_S1	Sales made to these customers do not require installation of the products by us and are not subject to other post-delivery obligations, except in occasional instances where we have agreed to perform installation or provide training.
21510_16_ITEM7_P77_S2	In those instances, we defer revenue related to installation services or training until these services have been rendered.
21510_16_ITEM7_P77_S3	We allocate revenue from multiple element arrangements to the various elements based upon fair values or a selling price hierarchy, as more fully described in Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition," in our consolidated financial statements.
21510_16_ITEM7_P77_S4	Should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions, revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected.
21510_16_ITEM7_P77_S5	Failure to obtain anticipated orders due to delays or cancellations of orders could have a material adverse effect on our revenue.
21510_16_ITEM7_P77_S6	In addition, pressures from customers to reduce our prices or to modify our existing sales terms may have a material adverse effect on our revenue in future periods.
21510_16_ITEM7_P77_S7	Our sales to distributors, representatives and end-user customers typically do not have customer acceptance provisions and only certain of our sales to OEM customers and integrators have customer acceptance provisions.
21510_16_ITEM7_P77_S8	Customer acceptance is generally limited to performance under our published product specifications.
21510_16_ITEM7_P77_S9	For the few product sales that have customer acceptance provisions because of higher than published specifications, (1) the products are tested and accepted by the customer at our site or the customer accepts the results of our testing program prior to shipment to the customer, or (2) the revenue is deferred until customer acceptance occurs.
21510_16_ITEM7_P78_S0	Sales to end-users in the scientific market typically require installation and, thus, involve post-delivery obligations; however our post-delivery installation obligations are not essential to the functionality of our products.
21510_16_ITEM7_P78_S1	We defer revenue related to installation services until completion of these services.
21510_16_ITEM7_P79_S0	For most products, training is not provided; therefore, no post-delivery training obligation exists.
21510_16_ITEM7_P79_S1	However, when training is provided to our customers, it is typically priced separately and recognized as revenue as these services are provided.
21510_16_ITEM7_P79_S2	For multiple element arrangements which include extended maintenance contracts, we allocate and defer the amount of consideration equal to the separately stated price and recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
21510_16_ITEM7_P80_S0	We evaluate long-lived assets and amortizable intangible assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances or our planned use of assets indicate that their carrying amounts may not be fully recoverable or that their useful lives are no longer appropriate.
21510_16_ITEM7_P80_S1	Reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying values of the assets are impaired based on comparison to the undiscounted expected future cash flows identifiable to such long-lived and amortizable intangible assets.
21510_16_ITEM7_P80_S2	If the comparison indicates that impairment exists, the impaired asset is written down to its fair value.
21510_16_ITEM7_P81_S0	We have determined that our reporting units are the same as our operating segments as each constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results.
21510_16_ITEM7_P81_S1	We make this determination in a manner consistent with how the operating segments are managed.
21510_16_ITEM7_P81_S2	Based on this analysis, we have identified two reporting units which are our reportable segments: SLS and CLC.
21510_16_ITEM7_P82_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and written down when impaired (see Note 7 "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).
21510_16_ITEM7_P82_S1	We generally perform our annual impairment tests during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter, with any resulting impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.
21510_16_ITEM7_P82_S2	In fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016, we conducted a qualitative assessment of the goodwill in the SLS reporting unit during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount.
21510_16_ITEM7_P82_S3	In assessing the qualitative factors, we considered the impact of these key factors: macroeconomic conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency, market and industry conditions, our operating and competitive environment, regulatory and political developments, the overall financial performance of our reporting units including cost factors and budgeted-to-actual revenue results.
21510_16_ITEM7_P82_S4	We also considered our market capitalization, stock price performance and the significant excess calculated in the prior year between estimated fair value and the carrying value of SLS.
21510_16_ITEM7_P82_S5	Based on our assessment, goodwill in the SLS reporting unit was not impaired as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, 2015 or 2016.
21510_16_ITEM7_P82_S6	As such, it was not necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test at that time in any of those fiscal years.
21510_16_ITEM7_P82_S7	For our CLC reporting unit we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment in fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016 and proceeded directly to performing the first step of goodwill impairment.
21510_16_ITEM7_P82_S8	Accordingly, we performed the Step 1 test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014.
21510_16_ITEM7_P82_S9	We determined the fair value of the reporting unit for the Step 1 test using a 50-50% weighting of the Income (discounted cash flow) approach and Market (market comparable) approach.
21510_16_ITEM7_P83_S0	The Income approach utilizes the discounted cash flow model to provide an estimation of fair value based on the cash flows that a business expects to generate.
21510_16_ITEM7_P83_S1	These cash flows are based on forecasts developed internally by management which are then discounted at an after tax rate of return required by equity and debt market participants of a business enterprise.
21510_16_ITEM7_P83_S2	This rate of return or cost of capital is weighted based on the capitalization of comparable companies.
21510_16_ITEM7_P84_S0	The Market approach determines fair value by comparing the reporting units to comparable companies in similar lines of business that are publicly traded.
21510_16_ITEM7_P84_S1	Total Enterprise Value (TEV) multiples such as TEV to revenues and TEV to earnings (if applicable) before interest and taxes of the publicly traded companies are calculated.
21510_16_ITEM7_P84_S2	These multiples are then applied to the reporting unit's operating results to obtain an estimate of fair value.
21510_16_ITEM7_P84_S3	Each of these two approaches captures aspects of value in each reporting unit.
21510_16_ITEM7_P84_S4	The Income approach captures our expected future performance, and the Market approach captures how investors view the reporting units through other competitors.
21510_16_ITEM7_P84_S5	We believe these valuation approaches are proven valuation techniques and methodologies for our industry and are widely accepted by investors.
21510_16_ITEM7_P84_S6	As neither was perceived by us to deliver any greater indication of value than the other, and neither approach individually computed a fair value less than the carrying value of the segment, we weighted each of the approaches equally.
21510_16_ITEM7_P84_S7	Management completed and reviewed the results of the Step 1 analysis and concluded that a Step 2 analysis was not required as the estimated fair value of the CLC reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value.
21510_16_ITEM7_P84_S8	Between the completion of that testing and the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we noted no indications of impairment or triggering events for either reporting unit to cause us to review goodwill for potential impairment.
21510_16_ITEM7_P84_S9	At October 1, 2016 , we had $101.5 million of goodwill ( $95.1 million SLS and $6.4 million in CLC), $13.9 million of purchased intangible assets and $127.4 million of property and equipment on our consolidated balance sheet.
21510_16_ITEM7_P85_S0	Inventory Valuation We record our inventory at the lower of cost (computed on a first-in, first-out basis) or market.
21510_16_ITEM7_P85_S1	We write-down our inventory to its estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
21510_16_ITEM7_P85_S2	Inventory write-downs are generally recorded within guidelines set by management when the inventory for a device exceeds 12 months of its demand or when management has deemed parts are no longer active or useful.
21510_16_ITEM7_P85_S3	If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required which could materially affect our future results of operations.
21510_16_ITEM7_P85_S4	Due to rapidly changing forecasts and orders, additional write-downs for excess or obsolete inventory, while not currently expected, could be required in the future.
21510_16_ITEM7_P85_S5	In the event that alternative future uses of fully written down inventories are identified, we may experience better than normal profit margins when such inventory is sold.
21510_16_ITEM7_P86_S0	between actual results and previous estimates of excess and obsolete inventory could materially affect our future results of operations.
21510_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	We write-down our demo inventory by amortizing the cost of demo inventory over a twenty month period starting from the fourth month after such inventory is placed in service.
21510_16_ITEM7_P87_S1	We provide warranties on the majority of our product sales and allowances for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale.
21510_16_ITEM7_P87_S2	The determination of such allowances requires us to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty.
21510_16_ITEM7_P87_S3	We currently establish warranty reserves based on historical warranty costs for each product line.
21510_16_ITEM7_P87_S4	The weighted average warranty period covered is approximately 15 months .
21510_16_ITEM7_P87_S5	If actual return rates and/or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates, adjustments to cost of sales may be required in future periods.
21510_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation using fair value.
21510_16_ITEM7_P88_S1	We estimate the fair value of performance restricted stock units granted using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
21510_16_ITEM7_P88_S2	We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.
21510_16_ITEM7_P88_S3	We value service-based restricted stock units using the intrinsic value method and amortize the value on a straight-line basis over the restriction period.
21510_16_ITEM7_P88_S4	We value performance restricted stock units using a Monte Carlo simulation model and amortize the value over the performance period, with no adjustment in future periods, based upon the actual shareholder return over the performance period.
21510_16_ITEM7_P89_S0	U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") requires the use of option pricing models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options.
21510_16_ITEM7_P90_S0	The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short-lived exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
21510_16_ITEM7_P90_S1	In addition, option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the options expected life, the expected price volatility of the underlying stock and an estimate of expected forfeitures.
21510_16_ITEM7_P91_S0	Our computation of expected volatility considers historical volatility and market-based implied volatility.
21510_16_ITEM7_P91_S1	Our estimate of expected forfeitures is based on historical employee data and could differ from actual forfeitures.
21510_16_ITEM7_P91_S2	See Note 12 "Employee Stock Award and Benefit Plans" in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our stock-based employee compensation plans and the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of stock-based employee compensation.
21510_16_ITEM7_P92_S0	Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income tax provision (benefit) in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
21510_16_ITEM7_P92_S1	This process involves us estimating our current income tax provision (benefit) together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
21510_16_ITEM7_P92_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets.
21510_16_ITEM7_P93_S0	We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized.
21510_16_ITEM7_P93_S1	While we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made.
21510_16_ITEM7_P93_S2	Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.
21510_16_ITEM7_P93_S3	During fiscal 2016, we increased our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by $2.1 million to $17.6 million, primarily due to the increase in California and certain state research and development tax credits, which are not expected to be recognized.
21510_16_ITEM7_P93_S4	The Company had U.S. federal deferred tax assets related to research and development credits, foreign tax credits and other tax attributes that can be used to offset federal taxable income in future periods.
21510_16_ITEM7_P93_S5	These credit carryforwards will expire if they are not used within certain time periods.
21510_16_ITEM7_P93_S6	As of October 1, 2016, management determined that there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not sufficient taxable income will exist in the future allowing us to recognize these deferred tax assets.
21510_16_ITEM7_P93_S7	It is possible that some or all these attributes could ultimately expire unused.
21510_16_ITEM7_P93_S8	If facts and circumstances change in the future, management may determine at that time a valuation allowance is necessary.
21510_16_ITEM7_P93_S9	A valuation allowance would materially increase our tax expense in the period applied and would adversely affect our results of operations and statement of financial condition.
21510_16_ITEM7_P93_S10	Changes in the Company s underlying facts or circumstances, such as the impact of the Rofin-Sinar merger, will be assessed as they occur and the Company will re-evaluate its position accordingly.
21510_16_ITEM7_P94_S0	Federal and state income taxes have not been provided on a portion of the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested.
21510_16_ITEM7_P94_S1	The total amount of unremitted earnings (including accumulated translation adjustments) of foreign subsidiaries for which we have not yet recorded federal and state income taxes was approximately $574.0 million at fiscal 2016 year-end.
21510_16_ITEM7_P94_S2	The amount of federal and state income taxes that would be payable upon repatriation of such earnings is not practicably determinable.
21510_16_ITEM7_P94_S3	We have not, nor do we anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the United States to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Interest rate sensitivity A portion of our investment portfolio is composed of fixed income securities.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P1_S2	If interest rates were to increase immediately (whether due to changes in overall market rates or credit worthiness of the issuers of our individual securities) and uniformly by 10% from levels at fiscal 2016 year-end, the fair value of the portfolio, based on quoted market prices in active markets involving similar assets, would decline by an immaterial amount due to their short-term maturities.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P1_S3	We have the ability to generally hold our fixed income investments until maturity and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P1_S4	If necessary, we may sell short-term investments prior to maturity to meet our liquidity needs.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P1_S5	At fiscal 2016 year-end, the fair value of our available-for-sale debt securities was $25.1 million , all of which was classified as short-term investments.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P1_S6	There were no gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities at fiscal 2016 year-end.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P1_S7	At fiscal 2015 year-end, the fair value of our available-for-sale debt securities was $178.4 million, all of which was classified as short-term investments.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P1_S8	Gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities were $1.1 million and $(2,000), respectively, at fiscal 2015 year-end.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Foreign currency exchange risk We maintain operations in various countries outside of the United States and have foreign subsidiaries that manufacture and sell our products in various global markets.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The majority of our sales are transacted in U.S. dollars.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P2_S2	However, we do generate revenues in other currencies, primarily the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the South Korean Won and the Chinese RMB.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Additionally, we have operations in different countries around the world with costs incurred in other local currencies, such as British Pound Sterling, Singapore Dollars and Malaysian Ringgit.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P2_S4	As a result, our earnings, cash flows and cash balances are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P2_S5	For example, we have significant manufacturing operations in Europe so that a weakening Euro is advantageous to our financial results.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P2_S6	We attempt to limit these exposures through financial market instruments.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P2_S7	We utilize derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts with maturities of two months or less, to manage our exposure associated with anticipated cash flows and net asset and liability positions denominated in foreign currencies.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P2_S8	Gains and losses on the forward contracts are mitigated by gains and losses on the underlying instruments.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P3_S1	On occasion, we enter into currency forward exchange contracts to hedge specific anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions generally expected to occur within the next 12 months.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P3_S2	These cash flow hedges are designated for hedge accounting treatment and gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholder's equity and reclassified into earnings at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized in earnings.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P3_S3	See Note 6 "Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities".
21510_16_ITEM7A_P4_S0	On August 1, 2016, we purchased forward contracts totaling 670.0 million Euro, with a value date of November 30, 2016, to limit our foreign exchange risk related to the commitment of our term loan (denominated in Euros) in an amount of the Euro equivalent of $750.0 million to finance the U.S. dollar payment for the acquisition of Rofin.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P4_S1	In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we recognized an unrealized loss of $2.2 million on these hedges.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P4_S2	Subsequent to October 1, 2016, we settled these hedges at a net gain of $3.1 million, resulting in a realized gain of $5.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P4_S3	See Note 6 "Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of this report.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P4_S4	We do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P4_S5	There can be no assurance that these strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P5_S0	If a financial counterparty to any of our hedging arrangements experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge, we may experience material financial losses.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P6_S0	In the current economic environment, the risk of failure of a financial party remains high.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P7_S0	At October 1, 2016 , approximately $331.0 million of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were held outside the U.S. in certain of our foreign operations, $93.1 million of which was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P7_S1	See Note 16, "Subsequent Events" in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of this annual report for further discussion of the completion of our acquisition of Rofin and the use of cash to finance the acquisition.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P8_S0	A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency rates on our forward contracts would not have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P9_S0	The following table provides information about our foreign exchange forward contracts at October 1, 2016 .
21510_16_ITEM7A_P9_S1	The table presents the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates, the value of the contracts in U.S. dollars at the contract exchange rate as of the contract maturity date and fair value.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P9_S2	The U.S. fair value represents the fair value of the contracts valued at October 1, 2016 rates.
21510_16_ITEM7A_P10_S0	Forward contracts to sell (buy) foreign currencies (in thousands, except contract rates):
21510_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by this annual report ("Evaluation Date").
21510_16_ITEM9A_P0_S1	The controls evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.
21510_16_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
21510_16_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the Company.
21510_16_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 1, 2016 , utilizing the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).
21510_16_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on the assessment by management, we determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 1, 2016 .
21510_16_ITEM9A_P1_S3	The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 1, 2016 has been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears below.
21510_16_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Inherent Limitations Over Internal Controls Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
21510_16_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
21510_16_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
21510_16_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
21510_16_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
21510_16_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud.
21510_16_ITEM9A_P4_S0	A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
21510_16_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
21510_16_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
21510_16_ITEM9A_P4_S3	Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
21510_16_ITEM9A_P4_S4	There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended October 1, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
21510_16_ITEM9A_P5_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Coherent, Inc.
21510_16_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Santa Clara, CA We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Coherent, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") as of October 1, 2016 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
21510_16_ITEM9A_P5_S2	The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
21510_16_ITEM9A_P5_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
21510_16_ITEM9A_P5_S4	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
21510_16_ITEM9A_P5_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
21510_16_ITEM9A_P5_S6	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
21510_16_ITEM9A_P5_S7	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
21510_16_ITEM9A_P6_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
21510_16_ITEM9A_P6_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
21510_16_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
21510_16_ITEM9A_P6_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
21510_16_ITEM9A_P6_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 1, 2016 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
21510_16_ITEM9A_P6_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended October 1, 2016 , of the Company and our report dated November 29, 2016 , expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

21510_16_ITEM15_P11_S0	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Coherent, Inc. Santa Clara, CA We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Coherent, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") as of October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015 , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 1, 2016 .

21510_16_ITEM15_P16_S0	DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Founded in 1966, Coherent, Inc. provides lasers and laser-based technology in a broad range of commercial and scientific research applications.
21510_16_ITEM15_P16_S1	Coherent designs, manufactures, services and markets lasers and related accessories for a diverse group of customers.
21510_16_ITEM15_P16_S2	Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, the Company has worldwide operations including research and development, manufacturing, sales, service and support capabilities.
21510_16_ITEM15_P17_S0	Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30.
21510_16_ITEM15_P17_S1	Fiscal years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 ended on October 1, 2016 , October 3, 2015 and September 27, 2014 , respectively, and are referred to in these financial statements as fiscal 2016 , fiscal 2015 , and fiscal 2014 for convenience.
21510_16_ITEM15_P17_S2	Fiscal years 2016 and 2014 include 52 weeks and fiscal year 2015 includes 53 weeks.
21510_16_ITEM15_P17_S3	The fiscal years of the majority of our international subsidiaries end on September 30.
21510_16_ITEM15_P17_S4	Accordingly, the financial statements of these subsidiaries as of that date and for the years then ended have been used for our consolidated financial statements.
21510_16_ITEM15_P17_S5	Management believes that the impact of the use of different year-ends is immaterial to our consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.
21510_16_ITEM15_P18_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
21510_16_ITEM15_P18_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
21510_16_ITEM15_P19_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Coherent, Inc. and its majority-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company", "we", "our", or "Coherent").
21510_16_ITEM15_P19_S1	Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
21510_16_ITEM15_P20_S0	The carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments including accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
21510_16_ITEM15_P21_S0	Short-term investments are comprised of available-for-sale securities, which are carried at fair value.
21510_16_ITEM15_P21_S1	Other non-current assets include trading securities and life insurance contracts related to our deferred compensation plans; trading securities are carried at fair value and life insurance contracts are carried at cash surrender values, which due to their ability to be converted to cash at that amount, approximate their fair values.
21510_16_ITEM15_P22_S0	Foreign exchange contracts are stated at fair value based on prevailing financial market information.
21510_16_ITEM15_P23_S0	Cash Equivalents All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.
21510_16_ITEM15_P23_S1	At fiscal 2016 year-end, cash and cash equivalents included cash and money market funds.
21510_16_ITEM15_P24_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that may potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable.
21510_16_ITEM15_P24_S1	At fiscal 2016 year-end, the majority of our short-term investments were in commercial paper and equity securities.
21510_16_ITEM15_P24_S2	Cash equivalents and short-term investments are maintained with several financial institutions and may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such balances.
21510_16_ITEM15_P24_S3	At October 1, 2016 , we held cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments outside the U.S. in certain of our foreign operations totaling approximately $331.0 million , $93.1 million of which was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
21510_16_ITEM15_P25_S0	The majority of our accounts receivable are derived from sales to customers for commercial applications.
21510_16_ITEM15_P25_S1	We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition and limit the amount of credit extended when deemed necessary but generally require no collateral.
21510_16_ITEM15_P25_S2	In certain instances, we may require customers to issue a letter of credit.
21510_16_ITEM15_P25_S3	We maintain reserves for potential credit losses.
21510_16_ITEM15_P25_S4	Our products are broadly distributed and there was one customer who accounted for 18.0% and 21.4% of accounts receivable at fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 year-end.
21510_16_ITEM15_P25_S5	We had another customer who accounted for 18.7% of accounts receivable at fiscal 2016 year-end.
21510_16_ITEM15_P26_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2.
21510_16_ITEM15_P27_S0	Derivative Financial Instruments Our primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate risk.
21510_16_ITEM15_P27_S1	Principal currencies hedged include the Euro, South Korean Won, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Chinese Renminbi, Malaysian Ringgit and Singapore dollar.
21510_16_ITEM15_P28_S0	Our derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value, on a gross basis, and are included in other current assets and other current liabilities.
21510_16_ITEM15_P28_S1	Our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments are based on whether they meet the criteria for designation as a cash flow hedge.
21510_16_ITEM15_P28_S2	Changes in the fair value of these cash flow hedges that are highly effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same line item on the consolidated statements of operations as the impact of the hedged transaction during the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
21510_16_ITEM15_P29_S0	The ineffective portion of cash flow hedges are recognized immediately in other income and expenses.
21510_16_ITEM15_P30_S0	Derivatives that we designate as cash flow hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the same section as the underlying item, primarily within cash flows from operating activities.
21510_16_ITEM15_P30_S1	The changes in fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges are recognized immediately in other income (expense).
21510_16_ITEM15_P30_S2	We formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
21510_16_ITEM15_P31_S0	This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as cash-flow hedges to specific forecasted transactions.
21510_16_ITEM15_P31_S1	We also assess, both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items.
21510_16_ITEM15_P32_S0	Accounts Receivable Allowances Accounts receivable allowances reflect our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our accounts receivable balances.
21510_16_ITEM15_P32_S1	We regularly review allowances by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality, the age of the accounts receivable balances and current economic conditions that may affect a customer's ability to pay.
21510_16_ITEM15_P33_S0	Activity in accounts receivable allowance is as follows (in thousands):
21510_16_ITEM15_P34_S0	Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market.
21510_16_ITEM15_P34_S1	Inventories are as follows (in thousands):
21510_16_ITEM15_P35_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method.
21510_16_ITEM15_P35_S1	Cost, accumulated depreciation and amortization, and estimated useful lives are as follows (dollars in thousands):
21510_16_ITEM15_P36_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2.
21510_16_ITEM15_P37_S0	The fair value (the present value of estimated cash flows) of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.
21510_16_ITEM15_P37_S1	The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset.
21510_16_ITEM15_P37_S2	All of our existing asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return the property to its original condition upon lease termination at various sites and costs to clean up and dispose of certain fixed assets at our Sunnyvale, California site.
21510_16_ITEM15_P37_S3	We estimated that as of fiscal 2016 year-end, gross expected future cash flows of $3.1 million would be required to fulfill these obligations.
21510_16_ITEM15_P37_S4	The following table reconciles changes in our asset retirement liability for fiscal 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):
21510_16_ITEM15_P38_S0	At October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015 , the asset retirement liability is included in Other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
21510_16_ITEM15_P39_S0	Long-lived Assets We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, whenever events or changes in business circumstances or our planned use of long-lived assets indicate that their carrying amounts may not be fully recoverable or that their useful lives are no longer appropriate.
21510_16_ITEM15_P39_S1	Reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying values of long-lived assets are impaired based on a comparison to the undiscounted expected future net cash flows.
21510_16_ITEM15_P39_S2	If the comparison indicates that impairment exists, long-lived assets that are classified as held and used are written down to their respective fair values.
21510_16_ITEM15_P40_S0	When long-lived assets are classified as held for sale, they are written down to their respective fair values less costs to sell.
21510_16_ITEM15_P40_S1	Significant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that is used in the preparation of expected undiscounted cash flows.
21510_16_ITEM15_P40_S2	For fiscal years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , there were no significant asset impairments recorded other than the $2 million impairment of our investment in SiOnyx in fiscal 2015 (See Note 8.
21510_16_ITEM15_P40_S3	Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and written down when impaired (see Note 7.

21510_16_ITEM15_P42_S0	reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
21510_16_ITEM15_P42_S1	Moreover, an entity can bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the impairment test, and then resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period.
21510_16_ITEM15_P42_S2	In both our fiscal 2016 and 2015 annual testing, we performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill for our SLS reporting unit using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and noted no impairment.
21510_16_ITEM15_P42_S3	For the CLC reporting unit, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test.
21510_16_ITEM15_P42_S4	Accordingly, we performed our Step 1 test using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and noted no impairment in both fiscal 2016 and 2015.
21510_16_ITEM15_P43_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets, including acquired existing technology, customer lists and trade name are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, currently 3 year to 15 years (See Note 7.
21510_16_ITEM15_P44_S0	We provide warranties on the majority of our product sales and reserves for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale.
21510_16_ITEM15_P44_S1	The determination of such reserves requires us to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty.
21510_16_ITEM15_P44_S2	We currently establish warranty reserves based on historical warranty costs for each product line.
21510_16_ITEM15_P44_S3	The weighted average warranty period covered is approximately 15 months .
21510_16_ITEM15_P44_S4	If actual return rates and/or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates, adjustments to cost of sales may be required in future periods.
21510_16_ITEM15_P45_S0	Components of the reserve for warranty costs during fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 were as follows (in thousands):
21510_16_ITEM15_P46_S0	Loss contingencies We are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business.
21510_16_ITEM15_P46_S1	We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset, or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies.
21510_16_ITEM15_P46_S2	An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.
21510_16_ITEM15_P46_S3	If we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined, then we disclose the range of the possible loss.
21510_16_ITEM15_P46_S4	We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted or a range of possible loss should be disclosed.
21510_16_ITEM15_P47_S0	When a sales arrangement contains multiple elements, such as products and/or services, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy.
21510_16_ITEM15_P47_S1	Using the selling price hierarchy, we determine the selling price of each deliverable using vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ), if it exists, and otherwise third-party evidence ( TPE ).
21510_16_ITEM15_P47_S2	If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exists, we use estimated selling price ( ESP ).
21510_16_ITEM15_P47_S3	We generally expect that we will not be able to establish TPE due to the nature of the markets in which we compete, and, as such, we typically will determine selling price using VSOE or if not available, ESP.
21510_16_ITEM15_P48_S0	Our basis for establishing VSOE of a deliverable's selling price consists of standalone sales transactions when the same or similar product or service is sold separately.
21510_16_ITEM15_P49_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2.
21510_16_ITEM15_P50_S0	In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling price for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow price range, as defined by us.
21510_16_ITEM15_P50_S1	We also consider the geographies in which the products or services are sold, major product and service groups, and other environmental variables in determining VSOE.
21510_16_ITEM15_P50_S2	Absent the existence of VSOE and TPE, our determination of a deliverable's ESP involves evaluating several factors based on the specific facts and circumstances of these arrangements, which include pricing strategy and policies driven by geographies, market conditions, competitive landscape, correlation between proportionate selling price and list price established by management having the relevant authority, and other environmental variables in which the deliverable is sold.
21510_16_ITEM15_P51_S0	For multiple element arrangements which include extended maintenance contracts, we allocate and defer the amount of consideration equal to the separately stated price and recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
21510_16_ITEM15_P51_S1	We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered or the service has been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured.
21510_16_ITEM15_P51_S2	Revenue from product sales is recorded when all of the foregoing conditions are met and risk of loss and title passes to the customer.
21510_16_ITEM15_P51_S3	Sales to customers are generally not subject to any price protection or return rights.
21510_16_ITEM15_P52_S0	The majority of our sales are made to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), distributors, representatives and end-users in the non-scientific market.
21510_16_ITEM15_P52_S1	Sales made to these customers do not require installation of the products by us and are not subject to other post-delivery obligations, except in occasional instances where we have agreed to perform installation or provide training.
21510_16_ITEM15_P52_S2	In those instances, we defer revenue related to installation services or training until these services have been rendered.
21510_16_ITEM15_P52_S3	We allocate revenue from multiple element arrangements to the various elements based upon relative fair values.
21510_16_ITEM15_P52_S4	Our sales to distributors, representatives and end-user customers typically do not have customer acceptance provisions and only certain of our sales to OEM customers and integrators have customer acceptance provisions.
21510_16_ITEM15_P52_S5	Customer acceptance is generally limited to performance under our published product specifications.
21510_16_ITEM15_P52_S6	For the few product sales that have customer acceptance provisions because of higher than published specifications, (1) the products are tested and accepted by the customer at our site or the customer accepts the results of our testing program prior to shipment to the customer, or (2) the revenue is deferred until customer acceptance occurs.
21510_16_ITEM15_P53_S0	Sales to end-users in the scientific market typically require installation and, thus, involve post-delivery obligations; however, our post-delivery installation obligations are not essential to the functionality of our products.
21510_16_ITEM15_P53_S1	We defer revenue related to installation services until completion of these services.
21510_16_ITEM15_P54_S0	For most products, training is not provided; therefore, no post-delivery training obligation exists.
21510_16_ITEM15_P54_S1	However, when training is provided to our customers, it is typically priced separately and is recognized as revenue as these services are provided.
21510_16_ITEM15_P55_S0	We record taxes collected on revenue-producing activities on a net basis.
21510_16_ITEM15_P55_S1	Research and Development Research and development expenses include salaries, contractor and consultant fees, supplies and materials, as well as costs related to other overhead such as depreciation, facilities, utilities and other departmental expenses.
21510_16_ITEM15_P55_S2	The costs we incur with respect to internally developed technology and engineering services are included in research and development expenses as incurred as they do not directly relate to any particular licensee, license agreement or license fee.
21510_16_ITEM15_P55_S3	We treat third party and government funding of our research and development activity, where we are the primary beneficiary of such work conducted, as a reduction of research and development cost.
21510_16_ITEM15_P55_S4	Research and development reimbursements of $2.7 million , $2.5 million and $7.2 million were offset against research and development costs in fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
21510_16_ITEM15_P56_S0	The functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are generally their respective local currencies.
21510_16_ITEM15_P56_S1	Accordingly, gains and losses from the translation of the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income ("OCI").
21510_16_ITEM15_P56_S2	Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in earnings.
21510_16_ITEM15_P57_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2.
21510_16_ITEM15_P58_S0	Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources.
21510_16_ITEM15_P58_S1	Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (net of tax) at fiscal 2016 year-end is substantially comprised of accumulated translation adjustments of $(8.6) million and unrealized gain on marketable equity securities of $3.3 million .
21510_16_ITEM15_P58_S2	Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (net of tax) at fiscal 2015 year-end is substantially comprised of accumulated translation adjustments of $(10.4) million .
21510_16_ITEM15_P59_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period, excluding unvested restricted stock.
21510_16_ITEM15_P59_S1	Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period increased by the effect of dilutive employee stock awards, including stock options, restricted stock awards and stock purchase contracts, using the treasury stock method.
21510_16_ITEM15_P59_S2	The following table presents information necessary to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share (in thousands, except per share data):
21510_16_ITEM15_P60_S0	There were 323 , 0 and 47,242 potentially dilutive securities excluded from the dilutive share calculation for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, as its effect was anti-dilutive.
21510_16_ITEM15_P61_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation using the fair value of the awards granted.
21510_16_ITEM15_P61_S1	We value restricted stock units using the intrinsic value method, which is based on the fair market value price on the grant date.
21510_16_ITEM15_P61_S2	We use a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the fair value of performance restricted stock units.
21510_16_ITEM15_P61_S3	We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option and restricted stock unit forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.
21510_16_ITEM15_P61_S4	We amortize the fair value of stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods.
21510_16_ITEM15_P61_S5	See Note 12 "Employee Stock Award, Option and Benefit Plans" for a description of our stock-based employee compensation plans and the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of stock-based employee compensation.
21510_16_ITEM15_P62_S0	We record costs related to shipping and handling of net sales in cost of sales for all periods presented.
21510_16_ITEM15_P62_S1	Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are included in net sales.
21510_16_ITEM15_P62_S2	Custom duties billed to customers are recorded in cost of sales.
21510_16_ITEM15_P63_S0	Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income tax provision (benefit) in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
21510_16_ITEM15_P63_S1	This process involves us estimating our current income tax provision (benefit) together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
21510_16_ITEM15_P63_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets.
21510_16_ITEM15_P64_S0	We account for uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740-10 Income Taxes , which creates a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.
21510_16_ITEM15_P64_S1	This standard provides a two-step approach for evaluating tax positions.
21510_16_ITEM15_P64_S2	The first step, recognition, occurs when a company concludes (based solely on the technical aspects of the matter) that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority.
21510_16_ITEM15_P65_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2.
21510_16_ITEM15_P66_S0	measurement, is only considered after step one has been satisfied and measures any tax benefit at the largest amount that is deemed more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the uncertainty.
21510_16_ITEM15_P66_S1	These determinations involve significant judgment by management.
21510_16_ITEM15_P66_S2	Tax positions that fail to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first subsequent interim period that they meet the more likely than not standard or when they are resolved through negotiation or litigation with factual interpretation, judgment and certainty.
21510_16_ITEM15_P67_S0	Tax laws and regulations themselves are complex and are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, evolution of regulations and court filings.
21510_16_ITEM15_P67_S1	Therefore, the actual liability for U.S. or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially to reverse previously recorded tax liabilities.
21510_16_ITEM15_P68_S0	We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized.
21510_16_ITEM15_P68_S1	While we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made.
21510_16_ITEM15_P68_S2	Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.
21510_16_ITEM15_P69_S0	Federal and state income taxes have not been provided on a portion of the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested.
21510_16_ITEM15_P69_S1	The total amount of unremitted earnings (including accumulated translation adjustments) of foreign subsidiaries for which we have not yet recorded federal and state income taxes was approximately $574.0 million and $471.9 million at fiscal 2016 and 2015 year-end, respectively.
21510_16_ITEM15_P69_S2	The amount of federal and state income taxes that would be payable upon repatriation of such earnings is not practicably determinable.
21510_16_ITEM15_P69_S3	We have not, nor do we anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the United States to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business.
21510_16_ITEM15_P70_S0	Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements In November 2015, the FASB issued amended guidance that clarifies that in a classified statement of financial position, an entity shall classify deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent amounts.
21510_16_ITEM15_P70_S1	The new guidance supersedes ASC 740-10-45-5 which required the valuation allowance for a particular tax jurisdiction be allocated between current and noncurrent deferred tax assets for that tax jurisdiction on a pro rata basis.
21510_16_ITEM15_P70_S2	We elected to early adopt the standard retrospectively in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, which resulted in the reclassification of $28.1 million from current deferred income tax assets to non-current deferred income tax assets and non-current deferred income tax liabilities as of October 3, 2015.
21510_16_ITEM15_P71_S0	In April 2015, the FASB issued amended guidance that simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.
21510_16_ITEM15_P71_S1	The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amended guidance.
21510_16_ITEM15_P71_S2	The new standard will become effective for our fiscal year beginning October 2, 2016.
21510_16_ITEM15_P71_S3	We elected to early adopt the standard in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and have recorded the debt issuance costs of $5.2 million as of October 1, 2016 in other assets for the debt commitment we entered into in the second quarter of fiscal 2016.
21510_16_ITEM15_P71_S4	The debt issuance cost related to the term loan facility will be reclassified to debt in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
21510_16_ITEM15_P72_S0	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In October 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance that improves the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.
21510_16_ITEM15_P72_S1	Under the new guidance, an entity should recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs.
21510_16_ITEM15_P72_S2	The new standard will become effective for our fiscal year beginning October 1, 2018.
21510_16_ITEM15_P72_S3	We are currently assessing the impact of this amended guidance and the timing of adoption.
21510_16_ITEM15_P72_S4	In May 2016, accounting guidance was issued to clarify the not yet effective revenue recognition guidance issued in May 2014.
21510_16_ITEM15_P72_S5	This additional guidance does not change the core principle of the revenue recognition guidance issued in May 2014, rather, it provides clarification of accounting for collections of sales taxes as well as recognition of revenue (i) associated with contract modifications, (ii) for noncash consideration, and (iii) based on the collectability of the consideration from the customer.
21510_16_ITEM15_P72_S6	The guidance also specifies when a contract should be considered completed for purposes of applying the transition guidance.
21510_16_ITEM15_P72_S7	The effective date and transition requirements for this guidance are the same as the effective date and transition requirements for the guidance previously issued in 2014, which is effective for our fiscal year beginning September 30, 2018.
21510_16_ITEM15_P73_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2.
21510_16_ITEM15_P74_S0	We are currently evaluating the new guidance and have not determined the impact this standard may have on our financial statements nor have we decided upon the method of adoption.
21510_16_ITEM15_P75_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance that simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows.
21510_16_ITEM15_P75_S1	Under the new guidance, an entity recognizes all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement.
21510_16_ITEM15_P75_S2	This change eliminates the notion of the APIC pool and significantly reduces the complexity and cost of accounting for excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies.
21510_16_ITEM15_P75_S3	The new standard will become effective for our fiscal year beginning October 1, 2017.
21510_16_ITEM15_P75_S4	We are currently assessing the impact of this amended guidance and the timing of adoption.
21510_16_ITEM15_P76_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.
21510_16_ITEM15_P76_S1	The new guidance clarifies the criteria for distinguishing between a finance lease and operating lease, as well as classification between the two types of leases, which is substantially unchanged from the previous lease guidance.
21510_16_ITEM15_P76_S2	Further, the new guidance requires a lessee to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments.
21510_16_ITEM15_P76_S3	For finance leases, a lessee should recognize interest on the lease liability separately from amortization of the right-of-use asset.
21510_16_ITEM15_P76_S4	For operating leases, a lessee should recognize a single lease cost, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term on a generally straight-line basis.
21510_16_ITEM15_P76_S5	For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities.
21510_16_ITEM15_P76_S6	The new standard will become effective for our fiscal year beginning September 29, 2019.
21510_16_ITEM15_P76_S7	We are currently assessing the impact of this amended guidance and the timing of adoption.
21510_16_ITEM15_P77_S0	In January 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance that revises the recognition and measurement of financial instruments.
21510_16_ITEM15_P77_S1	The new guidance requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income, requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes, requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset, and eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost.
21510_16_ITEM15_P77_S2	The new standard will become effective for our fiscal year beginning September 30, 2018.
21510_16_ITEM15_P77_S3	We are currently assessing the impact of this amended guidance and the timing of adoption.
21510_16_ITEM15_P78_S0	On November 7, 2016, we acquired Rofin-Sinar Technologies, Inc. ("Rofin"), one of the world's leading developers and manufacturers of high-performance industrial laser sources and laser-based solutions and components.
21510_16_ITEM15_P78_S1	See Note 16, "Subsequent Events" for further discussion of the acquisition.
21510_16_ITEM15_P79_S0	On July 24, 2015, we acquired certain assets of Raydiance, Inc. ("Raydiance") for approximately $5.0 million , excluding transaction costs.
21510_16_ITEM15_P80_S0	Raydiance manufactured complete tools and lasers for ultrafast processing systems and subsystems in the precision micromachining processing market.
21510_16_ITEM15_P80_S1	The Raydiance assets have been included in our Specialty Lasers and Systems segment.

21510_16_ITEM15_P82_S0	Our allocation of the purchase price is as follows (in thousands):
21510_16_ITEM15_P83_S0	The purchase price allocated to goodwill was finalized in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, with an increase of $0.4 million and a corresponding decrease of $0.4 million to tangible assets, and has been updated from the preliminary allocation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
21510_16_ITEM15_P83_S1	Results of operations for the business have been included in our consolidated financial statements subsequent to the date of acquisition and pro forma results of operations in accordance with authoritative guidance for prior periods have not been presented because the effect of the acquisition was not material to our prior period consolidated financial results.
21510_16_ITEM15_P84_S0	The identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over their respective useful lives o f three to five years.
21510_16_ITEM15_P84_S1	None of the goodwill from this purchase is deductible for tax purposes.
21510_16_ITEM15_P84_S2	We expensed $0.1 million of acquisition-related costs as selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations for our fiscal year 2015.
21510_16_ITEM15_P84_S3	On July 27, 2015, we acquired the assets and certain liabilities of the Tinsley Optics ("Tinsley") business from L-3 Communications Corporation for approximately $4.3 million , excluding transaction costs.
21510_16_ITEM15_P85_S0	Tinsley is a specialized manufacturer of high precision optical components and subsystems sold primarily in the aerospace and defense industry.
21510_16_ITEM15_P85_S1	Tinsley manufactures the large form factor optics for our excimer laser annealing systems.
21510_16_ITEM15_P85_S2	Tinsley has been included in our Specialty Lasers and Systems segment.
21510_16_ITEM15_P85_S3	Our allocation of the purchase price is as follows (in thousands):
21510_16_ITEM15_P86_S0	The purchase price was lower than the fair value of net assets purchased, resulting in a gain of $1.3 million recorded as a separate line item in our consolidated statements of operations for our fiscal year 2015.
21510_16_ITEM15_P86_S1	The Company reassessed the recognition and measurement of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed and concluded that all acquired assets and assumed liabilities were recognized and that the valuation procedures and resulting measures were appropriate.
21510_16_ITEM15_P86_S2	Results of operations for the business have been included in our consolidated financial statements subsequent to the date of acquisition and pro forma results of operations in accordance with authoritative guidance for prior periods have not been presented because the effect of the acquisition was not material to our prior period consolidated financial results.
21510_16_ITEM15_P87_S0	The gain from the bargain purchase is not subject to income taxation.
21510_16_ITEM15_P87_S1	We expensed $0.4 million of acquisition-related costs as selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations for our fiscal year 2015.
21510_16_ITEM15_P88_S0	We measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value.
21510_16_ITEM15_P88_S1	The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets.
21510_16_ITEM15_P88_S2	We recognize transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter.
21510_16_ITEM15_P88_S3	There were no transfers between levels during the periods presented.
21510_16_ITEM15_P89_S0	As of October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015 , we did not have any assets or liabilities valued based on Level 3 valuations.
21510_16_ITEM15_P89_S1	Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015 are summarized below (in thousands):
21510_16_ITEM15_P90_S0	___________________________________________________ (1) Valuations are based upon quoted market prices.
21510_16_ITEM15_P90_S1	(2) Valuations are based upon quoted market prices in active markets involving similar assets.
21510_16_ITEM15_P90_S2	The market inputs used to value these instruments generally consist of market yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.
21510_16_ITEM15_P90_S3	Pricing sources include industry standard data providers, security master files from large financial institutions, and other third party sources which are input into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine a daily market value.
21510_16_ITEM15_P90_S4	This creates a consensus price or a weighted average price for each security.
21510_16_ITEM15_P90_S5	(3) The principal market in which we execute our foreign currency contracts is the institutional market in an over-the-counter environment with a relatively high level of price transparency.

21510_16_ITEM15_P92_S0	Our foreign currency contracts valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and quoted pricing intervals from public data sources and do not involve management judgment.
21510_16_ITEM15_P93_S0	At October 1, 2016 , prepaid expenses and other assets include $889 non-designated forward contracts; other current liabilities include $3,100 non-designated forward contracts.
21510_16_ITEM15_P93_S1	At October 3, 2015 , prepaid expenses and other assets include $217 non-designated forward contracts and $41 foreign currency contracts designated for cash flow hedges, respectively; other current liabilities include $239 non-designated forward contracts and $0 foreign currency contracts designated for cash flow hedges, respectively.
21510_16_ITEM15_P94_S0	See Note 6, "Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities".
21510_16_ITEM15_P94_S1	(4) The fair value of mutual funds is determined based on quoted market prices.
21510_16_ITEM15_P94_S2	Securities traded on a national exchange are stated at the last reported sales price on the day of valuation; other securities traded in over-the-counter markets and listed securities for which no sale was reported on that date are stated as the last quoted bid price.
21510_16_ITEM15_P95_S0	SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS We consider all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.
21510_16_ITEM15_P95_S1	Investments classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of related income taxes, recorded as a separate component of OCI in stockholders' equity until realized.
21510_16_ITEM15_P95_S2	Interest and amortization of premiums and discounts for debt securities are included in interest income.
21510_16_ITEM15_P95_S3	Gains and losses on securities sold are determined based on the specific identification method and are included in other income (expense).
21510_16_ITEM15_P95_S4	Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments consist of the following (in thousands):
21510_16_ITEM15_P96_S0	None of the unrealized losses as of October 1, 2016 or October 3, 2015 were considered to be other-than-temporary impairments.
21510_16_ITEM15_P97_S0	The amortized cost and estimated fair value of available-for-sale investments in debt securities as of October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015 , classified as short-term investments on our consolidated balance sheets, were as follows (in thousands):

21510_16_ITEM15_P99_S0	(1) Classified as short-term investments because these securities are highly liquid and can be sold at any time.
21510_16_ITEM15_P99_S1	During fiscal 2016 , we received proceeds totaling $126.0 million from the sale of available-for-sale securities and realized gross gains of less than $0.1 million .
21510_16_ITEM15_P99_S2	During fiscal 2015 , we received proceeds totaling $163.8 million from the sale of available-for-sale securities and realized gross gains of less than $0.1 million .
21510_16_ITEM15_P100_S0	DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES We maintain operations in various countries outside of the United States and have foreign subsidiaries that manufacture and sell our products in various global markets.
21510_16_ITEM15_P100_S1	The majority of our sales are transacted in U.S. dollars.
21510_16_ITEM15_P100_S2	However, we do generate revenues in other currencies, primarily the Euro, Japanese Yen, South Korean Won and Chinese Renminbi (RMB).
21510_16_ITEM15_P100_S3	As a result, our earnings, cash flows and cash balances are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
21510_16_ITEM15_P100_S4	We attempt to limit these exposures through financial market instruments.
21510_16_ITEM15_P100_S5	We utilize derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts with maturities of seven months or less, to manage our exposure associated with anticipated cash flows and net asset and liability positions denominated in foreign currencies.
21510_16_ITEM15_P100_S6	Gains and losses on the forward contracts are mitigated by gains and losses on the underlying instruments.
21510_16_ITEM15_P101_S0	We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
21510_16_ITEM15_P102_S0	The credit risk amounts represent the Company s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency rates at each respective date.
21510_16_ITEM15_P103_S0	For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense).
21510_16_ITEM15_P104_S0	On August 1, 2016, we purchased forward contracts totaling 670.0 million Euros, with a value date of November 30, 2016, to limit our foreign exchange risk related to the commitment of our term loan (denominated in Euros) in an amount of the Euro equivalent of $750.0 million to finance the U.S. dollar payment for the acquisition of Rofin.
21510_16_ITEM15_P104_S1	As of October 1, 2016, we had recognized an unrealized loss of $2.2 million on these contracts in other income (expense) net.
21510_16_ITEM15_P104_S2	Subsequent to October 1, 2016, we settled these hedges at a net gain of $3.1 million , resulting in a realized gain of $5.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
21510_16_ITEM15_P105_S0	Non-Designated Derivatives The outstanding notional contract and fair value asset (liability) amounts of non-designated hedge contracts, with maximum maturity of seven months, are as follows (in thousands):
21510_16_ITEM15_P106_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 6.
21510_16_ITEM15_P107_S0	Designated Derivatives Cash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of the hedge when we enter into contracts for specific future transactions.
21510_16_ITEM15_P107_S1	Cash flow hedges are evaluated for effectiveness quarterly.
21510_16_ITEM15_P108_S0	The effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is reported as a component of OCI in stockholder's equity and is reclassified into earnings when the underlying transaction affects earnings.
21510_16_ITEM15_P108_S1	We had no cash flow hedges outstanding at October 1, 2016 .
21510_16_ITEM15_P109_S0	Changes in the fair value of currency forward contracts due to changes in time value are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness and recognized in other income (expense) as incurred.
21510_16_ITEM15_P110_S0	We classify the cash flows from the foreign exchange forward contracts that are accounted for as cash flow hedges in the same section as the underlying item, primarily within cash flows from operating activities since we do not designate our cash flow hedges as investing or financing activities.
21510_16_ITEM15_P110_S1	The outstanding notional contract and fair value asset (liability) amounts of designated cash flow hedge contracts, which have all been settled prior to October 1, 2016, are as follows (in thousands):
21510_16_ITEM15_P111_S0	We had entered into certain derivative forward contracts to sell Japanese Yen and buy Euro to hedge revenue exposures related to our photonics-based solutions in Asia.
21510_16_ITEM15_P111_S1	In order to facilitate the hedge, we transacted with counterparties in the U.S. directly and then allocated the hedge contracts to our affiliates through a back-to-back relationship with our German subsidiary.
21510_16_ITEM15_P111_S2	The German subsidiary designated these hedge contracts as cash flow hedges under ASC 815.
21510_16_ITEM15_P111_S3	The hedges were settled prior to October 1, 2016 The fair value of our derivative instruments is included in prepaid expenses and other assets and in other current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets (See Note 4); such amounts were not material as of October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015 .
21510_16_ITEM15_P111_S4	The locations and amounts of designated and non-designated derivative instruments gains and losses in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015 were as follows (in thousands):
21510_16_ITEM15_P112_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 6.
21510_16_ITEM15_P113_S0	During the fiscal year ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015 , we recognized losses of $31,000 and $107,000 , respectively, in other income (expense) as ineffectiveness related to a portion of an anticipated hedged transaction that failed to occur within the original hedge period plus two months.
21510_16_ITEM15_P113_S1	The remainder of the hedged transaction occurred as expected and effective amounts were recognized in revenue or cost of sales as disclosed in the above table.
21510_16_ITEM15_P113_S2	The amounts that will be reclassified from OCI to earnings are generally offset by the recognition of the hedged transactions (e.g., anticipated cost of sales) in earnings, thereby achieving the realization of prices contemplated by the underlying risk management strategies and will vary from the expected amounts presented above as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates.
21510_16_ITEM15_P114_S0	To mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions, we enter into master netting arrangements that allow each counterparty in the arrangements to net settle amounts of multiple and separate derivative transactions under certain conditions.
21510_16_ITEM15_P114_S1	We present the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities within the our consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis even when derivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation.
21510_16_ITEM15_P114_S2	Our derivative contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features and do not require collateral or other security to be furnished by us or the counterparties.
21510_16_ITEM15_P114_S3	Offsetting of Financial Assets/Liabilities under Master Netting Agreements with Derivative Counterparties as of October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015 (in thousands):
21510_16_ITEM15_P115_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 6.
21510_16_ITEM15_P116_S0	(1) The balances at October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015 were related to derivative liabilities which are allowed to be net settled against derivative assets in accordance with the master netting agreements.
21510_16_ITEM15_P117_S0	(1) The balances at October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015 were related to derivative assets which are allowed to be net settled against derivative liabilities in accordance with the master netting agreements.
21510_16_ITEM15_P118_S0	GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have occurred, and we write down these assets when impaired.
21510_16_ITEM15_P118_S1	We perform our annual impairment tests during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter, with any resulting impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.
21510_16_ITEM15_P119_S0	During fiscal 2016, Coherent had two reporting units: Specialty Laser Systems ("SLS") and Commercial Lasers and Components ("CLC").
21510_16_ITEM15_P119_S1	In our fiscal 2016 annual testing, we performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill for our SLS reporting unit during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount.
21510_16_ITEM15_P119_S2	In assessing the qualitative factors, we considered the impact of these key factors: macroeconomic conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency, market and industry conditions, our operating and competitive environment, regulatory and political developments, the overall financial performance of the reporting unit including cost factors and budgeted-to-actual revenue results.
21510_16_ITEM15_P119_S3	We also considered our market capitalization, stock price performance and the significant excess between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the SLS reporting unit.
21510_16_ITEM15_P119_S4	Based on our assessment, goodwill in the SLS reporting unit was not impaired as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.
21510_16_ITEM15_P119_S5	As such, it was not necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test at that time.
21510_16_ITEM15_P119_S6	For the CLC reporting unit, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test.
21510_16_ITEM15_P119_S7	We performed our Step 1 test using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and noted no impairment.
21510_16_ITEM15_P119_S8	We determined the fair value of the CLC reporting unit for the Step 1 test using a 50-50% weighting of the Income (discounted cash flow) approach and Market (market comparable) approach.
21510_16_ITEM15_P119_S9	Management completed and reviewed the results of the Step 1 analysis and concluded that a Step 2 analysis was not required as the estimated fair value of the CLC reporting unit was significantly in excess of its carrying value.
21510_16_ITEM15_P119_S10	Between the completion of that testing and the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we noted no indications of impairment or triggering events with either reporting unit to cause us to review goodwill for potential impairment.
21510_16_ITEM15_P120_S0	The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment for fiscal 2016 and 2015 are as follows (in thousands):
21510_16_ITEM15_P121_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 7.

21510_16_ITEM15_P123_S0	We evaluate long-lived assets and amortizable intangible assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances or our planned use of assets indicate that their carrying amounts may not be fully recoverable or that their useful lives are no longer appropriate.
21510_16_ITEM15_P123_S1	Reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying values of assets are impaired based on comparison to the undiscounted expected future cash flows identifiable to such long-lived and amortizable intangible assets.
21510_16_ITEM15_P123_S2	If the comparison indicates that impairment exists, the impaired asset is written down to its fair value.
21510_16_ITEM15_P124_S0	During fiscal 2016 , we wrote down IPR D of $0.4 million related to our fiscal 2013 acquisition of Innolight Innovative Laser and Systemtechnik GmbH as management abandoned the in-process R D projects in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.
21510_16_ITEM15_P124_S1	In fiscal 2015 and 2014 , we did not have any impairment of intangible assets as a result of the impairment analysis.
21510_16_ITEM15_P124_S2	The components of our amortizable intangible assets are as follows (in thousands):
21510_16_ITEM15_P125_S0	For accounting purposes, when an intangible asset is fully amortized, it is removed from the disclosure schedule.
21510_16_ITEM15_P126_S0	Amortizable intangible assets include intangible assets acquired through business combinations as well as through direct purchases or licenses.
21510_16_ITEM15_P126_S1	The weighted average remaining amortization period for existing technology is approximately 2.1 years , the weighted average remaining amortization period for customer lists is 2.8 years , and the weighted average remaining amortization period for trade name is 3.1 years .
21510_16_ITEM15_P126_S2	Amortization expense for intangible assets during fiscal years 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 was $8.5 million , $8.2 million and $9.6 million , respectively, which includes $6.0 million , $6.3 million and $7.5 million , respectively, for amortization of existing technology.

21510_16_ITEM15_P131_S2	During the third quarter of fiscal 2015 we determined that our investment became other-than temporarily impaired.
21510_16_ITEM15_P131_S3	As a result, during the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded a non-cash charge of $2.0 million in our results of operations to impair this investment.
21510_16_ITEM15_P131_S4	In determining the fair value of the cost method investment, we considered many factors including but not limited to operating performance of the investee, the amount of cash that the investee has on-hand, the ability to obtain additional financing and the overall market conditions in which the investee operates.
21510_16_ITEM15_P131_S5	The fair value of the cost method investment represents a Level 3 valuation as the assumptions used in valuing the investment were not directly or indirectly observable.
21510_16_ITEM15_P132_S0	For our $750.0 million debt financing commitment with certain lenders (See Note 9 "Borrowings"), we paid $5.2 million of debt issuance costs in fiscal 2016 and recorded it to other assets.

21510_16_ITEM15_P142_S0	Contingencies We are subject to legal claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, such as product liability, employment or intellectual property claims, including, but not limited to, the matters described below.
21510_16_ITEM15_P143_S0	On May 14, 2013, IMRA America ( Imra ) filed a complaint for patent infringement against two of our subsidiaries in the Regional Court of D sseldorf, Germany, captioned In re IMRA America Inc. versus Coherent Kaiserslautern GmbH et.
21510_16_ITEM15_P143_S1	The complaint alleges that the use of certain of the Company s lasers infringes upon EP Patent No. 754,103, entitled Method For Controlling Configuration of Laser Induced Breakdown and Ablation, issued November 5, 1997.
21510_16_ITEM15_P143_S2	The patent, now expired in all jurisdictions, is owned by the University of Michigan and licensed to Imra.
21510_16_ITEM15_P143_S3	The complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages, the cost of court proceedings and seeks to permanently enjoin the Company from infringing the patent in the future.
21510_16_ITEM15_P144_S0	Following the filing of the infringement suit, our subsidiaries filed a separate nullity action with the Federal Patent Court in Munich, Germany requesting that the court hold that the Patent was invalid based on prior art.
21510_16_ITEM15_P144_S1	On October 1, 2015, the Federal Patent Court ruled that the German portion of the Patent was invalid.
21510_16_ITEM15_P144_S2	Imra has appealed this decision to the Federal Court of Justice, the highest civil jurisdiction court in Germany.
21510_16_ITEM15_P144_S3	The infringement action is currently stayed pending the outcome of such appeal.
21510_16_ITEM15_P145_S0	Management has made an accrual with respect to this matter and has determined, based on its current knowledge, that the amount or range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the amounts already accrued is not reasonably estimable.
21510_16_ITEM15_P145_S1	Although we do not expect that such legal claims and litigation will ultimately have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, an adverse result in one or more matters could negatively affect our results in the period in which they occur.

21510_16_ITEM15_P155_S1	This plan, the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2011 Plan"), provides for grants of options, time-based restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units.
21510_16_ITEM15_P155_S2	In prior years, we had a stock plan for which employees and service providers were eligible participants and a non-employee Directors' Stock Option Plan for which only non-employee directors were eligible participants.

21510_16_ITEM15_P156_S5	The annual grant for non-employee directors is 3,500 shares of restricted stock units that vest on February 15 of the calendar year following the grant.
21510_16_ITEM15_P156_S6	Restricted stock awards and restricted stock units are typically subject to vesting restrictions either time-based or market-based conditions for vesting.

21510_16_ITEM15_P163_S0	The expected term represents the period of our employee stock purchase plan.
21510_16_ITEM15_P163_S1	Our process for computing expected volatility considers both historical volatility and market-based implied volatility; however our estimate of expected forfeitures is based on historical employee data and could differ from actual forfeitures.
21510_16_ITEM15_P164_S0	The risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation method is based on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term.
21510_16_ITEM15_P165_S0	The fair values of shares purchased under the employee stock purchase plan for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 were estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:

21510_16_ITEM15_P166_S2	The performance stock unit agreements provide for the award of performance stock units with each unit representing the right to receive one share of our common stock to be issued after the applicable award vesting period.
21510_16_ITEM15_P166_S3	The final number of units awarded, if any, for these performance grants will be determined as of the vesting dates, based upon our total shareholder return over the performance period compared to the Russell 2000 Index and could range from no units to a maximum of twice the initial award units.
21510_16_ITEM15_P166_S4	The weighted average fair value for these performance units was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model incorporating the following weighted average assumptions:
21510_16_ITEM15_P167_S0	We recognize the estimated cost of these awards, as determined under the simulation model, over the related service period, with no adjustment in future periods based upon the actual shareholder return over the performance period.

21510_16_ITEM15_P182_S0	The effective tax rate on income before income taxes for fiscal 2016 of 28.8% was lower than the statutory rate of 35.0%.
21510_16_ITEM15_P182_S1	This was primarily due to differences related to the benefit of income subject to foreign tax rates that are lower than U.S. tax rates including the Singapore tax exemption, the benefit of foreign tax credits and the benefit of federal research and development tax credits including renewal of the federal research and development tax credits for fiscal 2015.
21510_16_ITEM15_P182_S2	These amounts are partially offset by deemed dividend inclusions under the Subpart F tax rules, stock-based compensation not deductible for tax purposes and limitations on the deductibility of compensation under IRC Section 162(m).
21510_16_ITEM15_P183_S0	In October 2016, Coherent Singapore received an amended Pioneer Status tax exemption from the Singapore authorities effective from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2021.

21510_16_ITEM15_P185_S0	In determining our fiscal 2016 and 2015 tax provisions under ASC Subtopic 740, we calculated the deferred tax assets and liabilities for each separate tax entity.
21510_16_ITEM15_P185_S1	We then considered a number of factors including the positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of our deferred tax assets to determine whether a valuation allowance should be recognized with respect to our deferred tax assets.
21510_16_ITEM15_P185_S2	We determined that a valuation allowance was appropriate for a portion of the deferred tax assets of our California and certain state research and development tax credits, foreign tax attributes and foreign net operating losses at fiscal 2016 and 2015 year-ends.
21510_16_ITEM15_P185_S3	During fiscal 2016 , we increased our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by $2.1 million to $17.6 million , primarily due to the increase in California and certain state research and development tax credits which are not expected to be recognized.
21510_16_ITEM15_P185_S4	The Company had U.S. federal deferred tax assets related to research and development credits, foreign tax credits and other tax attributes that can be used to offset federal taxable income in future periods.
21510_16_ITEM15_P185_S5	These credit carryforwards will expire if they are not used within certain time periods.
21510_16_ITEM15_P185_S6	As of October 1, 2016, management determined that there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not sufficient taxable income will exist in the future allowing us to recognize these deferred tax assets.
21510_16_ITEM15_P185_S7	It is possible that some or all these attributes could ultimately expire unused.

21510_16_ITEM15_P187_S1	A valuation allowance would materially increase our tax expense in the period applied and would adversely affect our results of operations and statement of financial condition.

21510_16_ITEM15_P202_S0	SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION At October 1, 2016, we were organized into two reportable operating segments: Specialty Lasers and Systems ("SLS") and Commercial Lasers and Components ("CLC").
21510_16_ITEM15_P202_S1	This segmentation reflects the go-to-market strategies for various products and markets.
21510_16_ITEM15_P202_S2	While both segments work to deliver cost-effective solutions, SLS develops and manufactures configurable, advanced-performance products largely serving the microelectronics, scientific research and government programs and OEM components and instrumentation markets.
21510_16_ITEM15_P202_S3	The size and complexity of many of our SLS products require service to be performed at the customer site by factory-trained field service engineers.
21510_16_ITEM15_P203_S0	CLC focuses on higher volume products that are offered in set configurations.
21510_16_ITEM15_P203_S1	The product architectures are designed for easy exchange at the point of use such that product service and repairs are based upon advanced replacement and depot (i.e., factory) repair.
21510_16_ITEM15_P204_S0	CLC's primary markets include materials processing, OEM components and instrumentation and microelectronics.
21510_16_ITEM15_P205_S0	We have identified SLS and CLC as operating segments for which discrete financial information is available.
21510_16_ITEM15_P205_S1	Both units have dedicated engineering, manufacturing, product business management and product line management functions.
21510_16_ITEM15_P206_S0	A small portion of our outside revenue is attributable to projects and recently developed products for which a segment has not yet been determined.
21510_16_ITEM15_P207_S0	The associated direct and indirect costs are presented in the category of Corporate and other, along with other corporate costs as described below.
21510_16_ITEM15_P208_S0	Our Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the chief operating decision maker (CODM) as he assesses the performance of the segments and decides how to allocate resources to the segments.
21510_16_ITEM15_P208_S1	Income from operations is the measure of profit and loss that our CODM uses to assess performance and make decisions.
21510_16_ITEM15_P208_S2	As assets are not a measure used to assess the performance of the company by the CODM, asset information is not tracked or compiled by segment and is not available to be reported in our disclosures.
21510_16_ITEM15_P209_S0	Income from operations represents the net sales less the cost of sales and direct operating expenses incurred within the operating segments as well as allocated expenses such as shared sales and manufacturing costs.
21510_16_ITEM15_P209_S1	We do not allocate to our operating segments certain operating expenses which we manage separately at the corporate level.
21510_16_ITEM15_P209_S2	These unallocated costs include stock-based compensation and corporate functions (certain research and development, management, finance, legal and human resources) and are included in the results below under Corporate and other in the reconciliation of operating results.
21510_16_ITEM15_P209_S3	Management does not consider unallocated Corporate and other costs in its measurement of segment performance.
21510_16_ITEM15_P209_S4	The following table provides net sales and income from operations for our operating segments a reconciliation of our total income from operations to net income (in thousands):
21510_16_ITEM15_P210_S0	Our foreign operations consist primarily of manufacturing facilities and sales offices in Europe and Asia-Pacific.
21510_16_ITEM15_P210_S1	Sales, marketing and customer service activities are conducted through sales subsidiaries throughout the world.
21510_16_ITEM15_P211_S0	Geographic sales information for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 is based on the location of the end customer.
21510_16_ITEM15_P211_S1	Geographic long-lived asset information presented below is based on the physical location of the assets at the end of each year.
21510_16_ITEM15_P211_S2	Sales to unaffiliated customers are as follows (in thousands):

21510_16_ITEM15_P213_S0	Major Customers We had one major customer who accounted for 13% , 17% and 13% of consolidated revenue during fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
21510_16_ITEM15_P213_S1	We had another major customer who accounted for 16% of consolidated revenue during fiscal 2016 .
21510_16_ITEM15_P213_S2	Both customers purchased primarily from our SLS segment.
21510_16_ITEM15_P214_S0	SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Acquisition of Rofin On November 7, 2016 , we completed our previously announced acquisition of Rofin pursuant to the Merger Agreement dated March 16, 2016.
21510_16_ITEM15_P215_S0	Rofin is one of the world's leading developers and manufacturers of high-performance industrial laser sources and laser-based solutions and components.
21510_16_ITEM15_P216_S0	discontinued operation until it is divested.
21510_16_ITEM15_P216_S1	The acquisition was an all-cash transaction at a price of $32.50 per share of Rofin common stock.
21510_16_ITEM15_P216_S2	The aggregate consideration paid by us to the former Rofin stockholders was approximately $904.5 million , excluding related transaction fees and expenses.
21510_16_ITEM15_P216_S3	We also paid $15.3 million due to the cancellation of options held by employees of Rofin.
21510_16_ITEM15_P216_S4	We funded the payment of the aggregate consideration with a combination of our available cash on hand and the proceeds from the Euro Term Loan described below.
21510_16_ITEM15_P216_S5	We are in the process of evaluating the business combination accounting considerations, including the consideration transferred and the initial purchase price allocation.
21510_16_ITEM15_P217_S0	Execution of the Credit Agreement On November 7, 2016 , we entered into the Credit Agreement by and among us, Coherent Holding GmbH, as borrower (the Borrower ), and certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries from time to time party thereto, as guarantors, the lenders from time to time party thereto, Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent and L/C Issuer, Bank of America, N.A., as L/C Issuer, and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., as L/C Issuer.
21510_16_ITEM15_P218_S0	The Credit Agreement provided for a 670.0 million Euro senior secured term loan facility and a $100.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility with a $30.0 million letter of credit sublimit and a $10.0 million swing line sublimit.
21510_16_ITEM15_P219_S0	We may increase the aggregate revolving commitments or borrow incremental term loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $150.0 million , subject to certain conditions, including obtaining additional commitments from the lenders then party to the Credit Agreement or new lenders.
21510_16_ITEM15_P219_S1	On November 7, 2016 , we borrowed the full 670.0 million Euros under the Euro Term Loan and its proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of Rofin and pay related fees and expenses.
21510_16_ITEM15_P219_S2	Also, on November 7, 2016 , we used 10.0 million Euro of the capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility for the issuance of a letter of credit.
21510_16_ITEM15_P219_S3	We expect to use future loans under the Revolving Credit Facility, if any, for general corporate purposes.
21510_16_ITEM15_P219_S4	The Credit Agreement replaces our existing $50.0 million Credit Agreement with Union Bank of California.
21510_16_ITEM15_P220_S0	The terms of the Credit Agreement require Borrower to prepay the term loans in certain circumstances, including from excess cash flow beyond a threshold amount, from the receipt of proceeds from certain dispositions or from the incurrence of certain indebtedness, and from extraordinary receipts resulting in net cash proceeds in excess of $10 million in any fiscal year.
21510_16_ITEM15_P220_S1	Borrower has the right to prepay loans under the Credit Agreement in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty.
21510_16_ITEM15_P220_S2	Revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, at which time all outstanding revolving loans must be repaid.
21510_16_ITEM15_P220_S3	The Euro Term Loan matures on the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date, at which time all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the Euro Term Loan must be repaid.
21510_16_ITEM15_P221_S0	Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Borrower s option, at a rate equal to either (i) the London interbank offered rate (the Eurocurrency Rate ) or (ii) a base rate (the Base Rate ) equal to the highest of (x) the federal funds rate, plus 0.50%, (y) the prime rate then in effect and (z) the Eurocurrency Rate for loans denominated in U.S. dollars applicable to a one-month interest period, plus 1.0%, in each case, plus an applicable margin.
21510_16_ITEM15_P221_S1	The applicable margin for term loans borrowed as Eurocurrency Rate loans, is 3.50% initially, and following the first anniversary of the Closing Date ranges from 3.00% to 3.50% depending on the consolidated total gross leverage ratio at the time of determination.
21510_16_ITEM15_P221_S2	For term loans borrowed as Base Rate Loans, the applicable margin initially is 2.50%, and following the first anniversary of the Closing Date ranges from 2.00% to 2.50% depending upon the consolidated total gross leverage ratio at the time of determination.
21510_16_ITEM15_P221_S3	The applicable margin for revolving loans borrowed as Eurocurrency Rate Loans, ranges from 3.75% to 4.25%, and for revolving loans borrowed as Base Rate Loans, ranges from 2.75% to 3.25%, in each case, based on the consolidated total gross leverage ratio at the time of determination.
21510_16_ITEM15_P222_S0	Interest on Base Rate Loans is payable quarterly in arrears.
21510_16_ITEM15_P222_S1	Interest on Eurocurrency Rate Loans is payable at the end of the applicable interest period.
21510_16_ITEM15_P222_S2	Interest periods for Eurocurrency Rate loans may be, at the Borrower s option, one, two, three or six months.
21510_16_ITEM15_P223_S0	The Credit Agreement requires the Borrower to make scheduled quarterly payments on the Euro Term Loan of 0.25% of the original principal amount of the Euro Term Loan, with any remaining principal payable at maturity.
21510_16_ITEM15_P223_S1	A commitment fee accrues on any unused portion of the revolving loan commitments under the Credit Agreement at a rate of 0.375% or 0.5% depending on the consolidated total gross leverage ratio at any time of determination.
21510_16_ITEM15_P223_S2	The Borrower is also obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type.
21510_16_ITEM15_P224_S0	On the Closing Date, we and certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries, as guarantors, provided an unconditional guaranty of all obligations of the Borrower and the other loan parties arising under the Credit Agreement, the other loan documents and under swap contracts and treasury management agreements with the lenders or their affiliates (with certain limited exceptions).
21510_16_ITEM15_P224_S1	The Borrower and the guarantors have also granted security interests in substantially all their assets to secure such obligations.
21510_16_ITEM15_P225_S0	The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, including covenants regarding the payment of taxes and other obligations, maintenance of insurance, reporting requirements and compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and negative covenants, including covenants limiting the ability of us and our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur debt, grant liens, make investments, make certain restricted payments, transact with affiliates, and sell assets.
21510_16_ITEM15_P225_S1	The Credit Agreement also requires us and our subsidiaries to maintain a senior secured net leverage ratio as of the last day of each fiscal quarter of less of than or equal to 3.50 to 1.00.

21510_16_ITEM15_P226_S1	If an event of default exists, the lenders may require the immediate payment of all Obligations, as defined in the Credit Agreement, and may exercise certain other rights and remedies provided for under the Credit Agreement, the other loan documents and applicable law.
21510_16_ITEM15_P226_S2	The acceleration of such obligations is automatic upon the occurrence of a bankruptcy and insolvency event of default.
21510_16_ITEM15_P227_S0	As a result of the acquisition of Rofin, and subsequent to fiscal 2016 year-end, we announced that in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we will reorganize our existing two segments into two new reporting segments for the combined company, OEM Laser Systems and Industrial Lasers and Systems.
21510_16_ITEM15_P227_S1	Accordingly, our segment information will be restated retroactively in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.

21510_17_ITEM1_P0_S0	Business Overview Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30.
21510_17_ITEM1_P0_S1	Fiscal years 2017 , 2016 and 2015 ended on September 30 , October 1 , and October 3 , respectively, and are referred to in this annual report as fiscal 2017 , fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 for convenience.
21510_17_ITEM1_P0_S2	Fiscal years 2017 and 2016 included 52 weeks and fiscal year 2015 included 53 weeks.
21510_17_ITEM1_P1_S0	We are one of the world's leading providers of lasers, laser-based technologies and laser-based system solutions in a broad range of commercial, industrial and scientific applications.
21510_17_ITEM1_P1_S1	We design, manufacture, service and market lasers and related accessories for a diverse group of customers.
21510_17_ITEM1_P1_S2	Since inception in 1966, we have grown through internal expansion and through strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies, intellectual property, manufacturing processes and product offerings.
21510_17_ITEM1_P1_S3	As a result of the acquisition of Rofin-Sinar Technologies Inc. ("Rofin") in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 (see discussion below), we reorganized our prior two reporting segments (Specialty Laser Systems and Commercial Lasers and Components) into two new reporting segments for the combined company: OEM Laser Sources ( OLS ) and Industrial Lasers Systems ( ILS ).
21510_17_ITEM1_P1_S4	This segment reorganization was based upon the organizational structure of the combined company and how the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") receives and utilizes information provided to allocate resources and make decisions.
21510_17_ITEM1_P1_S5	Accordingly, our segment information was restated retroactively for all periods presented.
21510_17_ITEM1_P1_S6	This segmentation reflects the go-to-market strategies and synergies for our broad portfolio of laser technologies and products.
21510_17_ITEM1_P1_S7	While both segments deliver cost-effective, highly reliable photonics solutions, the OLS business segment is focused on high performance laser sources and complex optical sub-systems typically used in microelectronics manufacturing, medical diagnostics and therapeutic medical applications, as well as in scientific research.
21510_17_ITEM1_P2_S0	Our ILS business segment delivers high performance laser sources, sub-systems and tools primarily used for industrial laser materials processing, serving important end markets like automotive, machine tool, consumer goods and medical device manufacturing.
21510_17_ITEM1_P3_S0	Income from operations is the measure of profit and loss that our chief operating decision maker ("CODM") uses to assess performance and make decisions.
21510_17_ITEM1_P3_S1	Income from operations represents the sales less the cost of sales and direct operating expenses incurred within the operating segments as well as allocated expenses such as shared sales and manufacturing costs.
21510_17_ITEM1_P3_S2	We do not allocate to our operating segments certain operating expenses, which we manage separately at the corporate level.
21510_17_ITEM1_P3_S3	These unallocated costs include stock-based compensation and corporate functions (certain advanced research and development, management, finance, legal and human resources) and are included in Corporate and other.
21510_17_ITEM1_P3_S4	Management does not consider unallocated Corporate and other costs in its measurement of segment performance.
21510_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	We were originally incorporated in California on May 26, 1966 and reincorporated in Delaware on October 1, 1990.
21510_17_ITEM1_P4_S1	Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and we are a member of the Standard Poor's MidCap 400 Index and the Russell 1000 Index.
21510_17_ITEM1_P4_S2	Additional information about Coherent, Inc. (referred to herein as the Company, we, our, or Coherent) is available on our web site at www.coherent.com.

21510_17_ITEM1_P5_S0	Any product, product name, process, or technology described in these materials is the property of Coherent.
21510_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	RECENT EVENTS On November 7, 2016, we completed our acquisition of Rofin pursuant to the Merger Agreement dated March 16, 2016.
21510_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	Rofin is one of the world's leading developers and manufacturers of high-performance industrial laser sources and laser-based solutions and components.

21510_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	A laser emits an intense coherent beam of light with some unique and highly useful properties.
21510_17_ITEM1_P11_S1	Most importantly, a laser is orders of magnitude brighter than any lamp.
21510_17_ITEM1_P11_S2	As a result of its coherence, the beam can be focused to a very small and intense spot, useful for applications requiring very high power densities including cutting and other materials processing procedures.
21510_17_ITEM1_P11_S3	The laser's high spatial resolution is also useful for microscopic imaging and inspection applications.
21510_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	Laser light can be monochromatic all of the beam energy is confined to a narrow wavelength band.
21510_17_ITEM1_P12_S1	Some lasers can be used to create ultrafast output a series of pulses with pulse durations as short as attoseconds (10 -18 seconds).
21510_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	There are many types of lasers and one way of classifying them is by the material or medium used to create the lasing action.
21510_17_ITEM1_P13_S1	This can be in the form of a gas, liquid, semiconductor, solid state crystal or fiber.
21510_17_ITEM1_P13_S2	Lasers can also be classified by their output wavelength: ultraviolet, visible, infrared or wavelength tunable.
21510_17_ITEM1_P13_S3	We manufacture all of these laser types.
21510_17_ITEM1_P13_S4	There are also many options in terms of pulsed output versus continuous wave, pulse duration, output power, beam dimensions, etc.
21510_17_ITEM1_P13_S5	In fact, each application has its own specific requirements in terms of laser performance.
21510_17_ITEM1_P13_S6	The broad technical depth at Coherent enables us to offer a diverse set of product lines characterized by lasers targeted at growth opportunities and key applications.
21510_17_ITEM1_P13_S7	In all cases, we aim to be the supplier of choice by offering a high-value combination of superior technical performance and high reliability.
21510_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	Photonics has taken its place alongside electronics as a critical enabling technology for the twenty-first century.
21510_17_ITEM1_P14_S1	Photonics based solutions are entrenched in a broad array of industries that include microelectronics, flat panel displays, machine tool, automotive and medical diagnostics, with adoption continuing in ever more diverse applications.
21510_17_ITEM1_P14_S2	Growth in these applications stems from two sources.
21510_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	First, there are many applications where the laser is displacing conventional technology because it can do the job faster, better or more economically (e.g. sheet metal cutting).
21510_17_ITEM1_P15_S1	Second, there are new applications where the laser is the enabling tool that makes the work possible, as in the conversion of amorphous silicon into poly crystalline silicon at low temperatures, where lasers are used in the manufacturing of high resolution flexible OLED displays found in the latest smart phones, tablet and laptop computers.
21510_17_ITEM1_P15_S2	Key laser applications include: semiconductor inspection; manufacturing of advanced printed circuit boards ("PCBs"); flat panel display manufacturing; solar cell production; medical and bio-instrumentation; materials processing; metal cutting and welding; industrial process and quality control; marking; imaging and printing; graphic arts and display; and research and development.
21510_17_ITEM1_P15_S3	For example, ultraviolet ( UV ) lasers are enabling the continuous move towards miniaturization, which drives innovation and growth in many markets.
21510_17_ITEM1_P15_S4	In addition, the advent of industrial grade ultrafast lasers continues to open up new applications for laser processing.
21510_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	Coherent occupies a unique position in the industry thanks to the breadth and depth of our product and technology portfolio, which includes lasers, optics, laser beam delivery components and laser systems.
21510_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	rails ), and for certain applications and markets we have also developed parts handling and automation to build complete laser production tools.
21510_17_ITEM1_P17_S1	We strive to develop innovative and proprietary products and solutions that meet the needs of our customers and that are based on our core expertise in lasers and optical technologies.
21510_17_ITEM1_P17_S2	In pursuit of our strategy, we intend to:

21510_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	Streamline our manufacturing structure and improve our cost structure We will focus on optimizing the mix of products that we manufacture internally and externally.
21510_17_ITEM1_P19_S1	We will utilize vertical integration where our internal manufacturing process is considered proprietary and seek to leverage external sources when the capabilities and cost structure are well developed and on a path towards commoditization.
21510_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	Focus on long-term improvement of adjusted EBITDA, in dollars and as a percentage of net sales We define adjusted EBITDA as operating income adjusted for depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, major restructuring costs and certain other non-operating income and expense items, such as costs related to our acquisition of Rofin.
21510_17_ITEM1_P20_S1	Key initiatives for EBITDA improvements include utilization of our Asian manufacturing locations, optimizing our supply chain and continued leveraging of our infrastructure.
21510_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	Optimize our leadership position in existing markets There are a number of markets where we have historically been at the forefront of technological development and product deployment and from which we have derived a substantial portion of our revenues.
21510_17_ITEM1_P21_S1	We plan to optimize our financial returns from these markets.
21510_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	Maintain and develop additional strong collaborative customer and industry relationships We believe that the Coherent brand name and reputation for product quality, technical performance and customer satisfaction will help us to further develop our loyal customer base.
21510_17_ITEM1_P22_S1	We plan to maintain our current customer relationships and develop new ones with customers who are industry leaders and work together with these customers to design and develop innovative product systems and solutions as they develop new technologies.
21510_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	Develop and acquire new technologies and market share We will continue to enhance our market position through our existing technologies and develop new technologies through our internal research and development efforts, as well as through the acquisition of additional complementary technologies, intellectual property, manufacturing processes and product offerings.
21510_17_ITEM1_P23_S1	APPLICATIONS Our products address a broad range of applications that we group into the following markets: Microelectronics, Materials Processing, OEM Components and Instrumentation and Scientific Research and Government Programs.
21510_17_ITEM1_P23_S2	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentages of total net sales by market application:
21510_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	Microelectronics Nowhere is the trend towards miniaturization and higher performance more prevalent than in the Microelectronics market where smart phones, tablets, personal computers ("PC's"), televisions ("TV's") and "wearables" are driving advances in displays, integrated circuits and PCBs.
21510_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	In response to market demands and consumer expectations, semiconductor and device manufacturers are continually seeking to improve their process and design technologies in order to manufacture smaller, more powerful and more reliable devices at lower cost.
21510_17_ITEM1_P25_S1	New laser applications and new laser technologies are a key element in delivering higher resolution and higher precision at lower manufacturing cost.
21510_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	We support three major markets in the microelectronics industry: (1) flat panel display ("FPD") manufacturing, (2) advanced packaging and interconnects ("API") and (3) semiconductor front-end ("SEMI").
21510_17_ITEM1_P26_S1	Microelectronics flat panel display manufacturing The high-volume consumer market is driving the production of FPDs in applications such as mobile phones, tablets, laptop computers, TVs and wearables.
21510_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	There are several types of established and emerging displays based on quite different technologies, including liquid crystal ("LCD") and organic light emitting diodes ("OLED").
21510_17_ITEM1_P27_S1	Each of these technologies utilize laser applications in their manufacturing process to enable improved yields, higher process speed, improved battery life, lower cost and/or superior display brightness, resolution and refresh rates.
21510_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	Several display types require a high-density pattern of silicon thin film transistors ("TFTs").
21510_17_ITEM1_P28_S1	If this silicon is polycrystalline as opposed to amorphous, the display performance is greatly enhanced.
21510_17_ITEM1_P28_S2	In the past, these polysilicon layers could only be produced on expensive special glass at high temperatures.
21510_17_ITEM1_P28_S3	However, excimer-based processes, such as excimer laser annealing ("ELA") have allowed high-volume production of low-temperature polysilicon ("LTPS") on conventional glass substrates as well as flexible displays based on plastic substrates.
21510_17_ITEM1_P28_S4	Our excimer lasers provide a unique solution for LTPS because they are the only industrial-grade excimer lasers optimized for this application.
21510_17_ITEM1_P28_S5	The current state-of-the-art product for this application is our excimer Vyper laser and LineBeam systems.
21510_17_ITEM1_P28_S6	These systems deliver power ranges of 1200W to 3600W, depending on the system, enabling a critical manufacturing process step with Generation 4, 5, 5.5 and 6 substrates.
21510_17_ITEM1_P28_S7	These systems are integral to the manufacturing process on all leading LTPS-based smart phone displays, with the highest commercially available pixel densities of greater than 300 pixels per inch (ppi), with the current trends going to even higher ppi ( 500 ppi) for high end smart phones, and hold the potential for deployment in tablet, laptop and OLED TV displays.
21510_17_ITEM1_P28_S8	Excimer based LTPS is also enabling a new generation of flexible OLED displays which are currently undergoing rapid growth as their adoption into smart phones accelerates.
21510_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	A modern flat panel display incorporates a number of different layers, some of which are thin films that need to be cut or structured.
21510_17_ITEM1_P29_S1	As film thicknesses decrease over time, lasers are becoming the tool of choice to process these materials.
21510_17_ITEM1_P29_S2	Our DIAMOND CO 2 and Rapid series ultrafast lasers are used for cutting FPD films.
21510_17_ITEM1_P29_S3	We have developed a proprietary technology for cutting of brittle materials such as glass and sapphire without debris and with zero kerf called SMART Cleave TM , which is used for cutting brittle materials used in displays.
21510_17_ITEM1_P29_S4	This technology uses ultrafast lasers coupled with proprietary optics.
21510_17_ITEM1_P29_S5	Our AVIA, Rapid, Monaco and DIAMOND CO 2 and CO lasers are also used in other production processes for FPDs.
21510_17_ITEM1_P29_S6	These processes include drilling, cutting, patterning, marking and yield improvement.
21510_17_ITEM1_P29_S7	Microelectronics advanced packaging and interconnects After a wafer is patterned, there are then a host of other processes, referred to as back-end processing, which finally result in a packaged encapsulated silicon chip.
21510_17_ITEM1_P29_S8	Ultimately, these chips are then assembled into finished products.
21510_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	The advent of high-speed logic and high-memory content devices has caused chip manufacturers to look for alternative technologies to improve performance and lower process costs.
21510_17_ITEM1_P30_S1	This search includes new types of materials, such as low-k and thinner silicon.
21510_17_ITEM1_P30_S2	Our AVIA, Rapid, Monaco and Matrix lasers provide economical methods of cutting and scribing these wafers while delivering higher yields than traditional mechanical methods.
21510_17_ITEM1_P30_S3	There are similar trends in chip packaging and PCB manufacturing requiring more compact packaging and denser interconnects.
21510_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	In many cases, lasers present enabling technologies.
21510_17_ITEM1_P31_S1	For instance, lasers are now the only economically practical method for drilling microvias in chip substrates and in both rigid and flexible PCBs.
21510_17_ITEM1_P31_S2	These microvias are tiny interconnects that are essential for enabling high-density circuitry commonly used in smart phones, tablets and advanced computing systems.
21510_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	Our DIAMOND CO 2 and AVIA diode pumped solid state ("DPSS") lasers are the lasers of choice in this application.
21510_17_ITEM1_P32_S1	The ability of these lasers to operate at very high repetition rates translates into faster drilling speeds and increased throughput in microvia processing applications.
21510_17_ITEM1_P33_S0	printing technologies can offer, which has led to widespread adoption of laser direct imaging ("LDI").
21510_17_ITEM1_P33_S1	Our Paladin laser is used for this application.
21510_17_ITEM1_P33_S2	Lasers have also become a valuable tool in high-brightness ("HB") light-emitting diode ("LED") manufacturing, improving LED performance and yield.
21510_17_ITEM1_P33_S3	LEDs have enjoyed widespread adoption as the light source in all categories of LCD displays, from phones to full size TVs and are also moving into general lighting.
21510_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	Our lasers are used in back-end processing of HB-LEDs.
21510_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	Microelectronics semiconductor front-end The term "front-end" refers to the production of semiconductor devices which occurs prior to packaging.
21510_17_ITEM1_P35_S1	As semiconductor device geometries decrease in size, devices become increasingly susceptible to smaller defects during each phase of the manufacturing process and these defects can negatively impact yield.
21510_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	One of the semiconductor industry's responses to the increasing vulnerability of semiconductor devices to smaller defects has been to use defect detection and inspection techniques that are closely linked to the manufacturing process.
21510_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	Detecting the presence of defects is only the first step in preventing their recurrence.
21510_17_ITEM1_P37_S1	After detection, defects must be examined in order to identify their size, shape and the process step in which the defect occurred.
21510_17_ITEM1_P37_S2	This examination is called defect classification.
21510_17_ITEM1_P37_S3	Identification of the sources of defects in the lengthy and complex semiconductor manufacturing process has become essential for maintaining high yield production.
21510_17_ITEM1_P37_S4	Semiconductor manufacturing has become an around-the-clock operation and it is important for products used for inspection, measurement and testing to be reliable and to have long lifetimes.
21510_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	Our Azure, Paladin, Excimer and ion lasers are used to detect and characterize defects in semiconductor chips.
21510_17_ITEM1_P39_S0	Materials processing The materials processing segment is comprised of four major markets: (1) automotive, (2) machine tool, (3) medical device and (4) consumer goods, as well a number of smaller markets.
21510_17_ITEM1_P39_S1	It is the most diverse of all the segments we serve and a large cross section of our products are used in this segment.

21510_17_ITEM1_P40_S0	At a high level, the drivers for laser deployment within the materials processing segment are faster processing with higher yields, processing of new and novel materials, more environmentally friendly processes and higher precision.
21510_17_ITEM1_P40_S1	With the broadest product portfolio in the laser industry, we offer solutions for almost any application on any material to our customers.
21510_17_ITEM1_P40_S2	The most common applications include cutting, welding, joining, drilling, perforating, scribing, engraving and marking.
21510_17_ITEM1_P41_S0	Lasers are used in a number of applications in the automotive industry, from fine processing of high precision parts to marking, as well as cutting of metals and welding large components such as gear boxes and car bodies.
21510_17_ITEM1_P41_S1	We serve this industry with a number of our products including ultrafast, DPSS, CO 2 , diode and fiber lasers as well as rails and tools in the areas of marking, scribing, cutting and welding.
21510_17_ITEM1_P42_S0	In the machine tool industry lasers have been the solution of choice for cutting metal for some time.
21510_17_ITEM1_P42_S1	Traditionally this was a market for high power CO 2 lasers, but with the advent of high power fiber lasers, a transition away from CO 2 took place in many applications.
21510_17_ITEM1_P42_S2	That transition is substantially done since fiber lasers are used in the majority of metal cutting applications.
21510_17_ITEM1_P42_S3	We serve this market with our high power fiber and CO 2 lasers.
21510_17_ITEM1_P42_S4	We are vertically integrated with active fiber manufacturing and are executing plans to be integrated with world class diodes, which makes us very well positioned to succeed in the high power fiber laser market in the intermediate and long term.
21510_17_ITEM1_P42_S5	We have a complete line of high power fiber lasers in power levels up to 10 kW. We offer lasers with different performance points in terms of power levels and beam profiles to address specific applications, including single mode lasers and advanced beam shaping options.
21510_17_ITEM1_P43_S0	Additive manufacturing or 3D printing is another growing market where lasers have seen rapid growth.
21510_17_ITEM1_P43_S1	We serve this market with CO 2 and DPSS lasers.
21510_17_ITEM1_P44_S0	The medical device market is characterized by its need for high precision manufacturing with high levels of quality control which lends itself very well to laser manufacturing.

21510_17_ITEM1_P44_S4	We serve these industries with almost all of our products from lasers to laser tools.
21510_17_ITEM1_P44_S5	As a consequence, this broad segment represents a stable and growing market for us.
21510_17_ITEM1_P44_S6	In summary, we serve the materials processing segment with a very broad product portfolio.
21510_17_ITEM1_P45_S0	DPSS lasers; the Monaco and Rapid series of ultrafast lasers; and the SLS, KLS, FLS and NA series of lamp pumped lasers.

21510_17_ITEM1_P46_S1	Representative applications within this market include bio-instrumentation, medical OEMs, graphic arts and display, machine vision and defense applications.
21510_17_ITEM1_P46_S2	We also support the laser-based instrumentation market with a range of laser-related components, including diode lasers and optical fibers.
21510_17_ITEM1_P46_S3	Our OEM component business includes sales to other, less integrated laser manufacturers participating in OEM markets such as materials processing, scientific, and medical.
21510_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	Bio-instrumentation Laser applications for bio-instrumentation include bio-agent detection for point source and standoff detection of pathogens or other bio-toxins; confocal microscopy for biological imaging that allows researchers and clinicians to visualize cellular and subcellular structures and processes with an incredible amount of detail; DNA sequencing where lasers provide automation and data acquisition rates that would be impossible by any other method; drug discovery genomic and proteomic analyses that enable drug discovery to proceed at very high throughput rates; and flow cytometry for analyzing single cells or populations of cells in a heterogeneous mixture, including blood samples.
21510_17_ITEM1_P47_S1	Our OBIS, Flare, Galaxy, Sapphire, BioRay and Genesis lasers are used in several bio-instrumentation applications.
21510_17_ITEM1_P47_S2	Medical Therapy We sell a variety of components and lasers to medical laser companies for use in end-user applications such as ophthalmology, aesthetic, surgical, therapeutic and dentistry.
21510_17_ITEM1_P47_S3	Our DIAMOND series CO 2 lasers are widely used in ophthalmic, aesthetic and surgical markets.
21510_17_ITEM1_P47_S4	We have a leading position in Lasik and photorefractive keratectomy surgery methods with our ExciStar XS excimer laser platform.
21510_17_ITEM1_P47_S5	We also provide ultrafast lasers for use in cataract surgery and optical fibers for surgical applications.
21510_17_ITEM1_P47_S6	The unique ability of our optically pumped semiconductor lasers ("OPSL") technology to match a wavelength to an application has led to the development of a high-power yellow (577nm) laser for the treatment of eye related diseases, such as Age Related Macular Degeneration and retinal diseases associated with diabetes.
21510_17_ITEM1_P47_S7	The 577nm wavelength was designed to match the peak in absorption of oxygenated hemoglobin thereby allowing treatment to occur at a lower power level, and thus reducing stress and heat-load placed on the eye with traditional green-based (530nm) solid state lasers.
21510_17_ITEM1_P47_S8	Other applications where our OBIS, Genesis and Sapphire series of lasers are used include the retinal scanning market in diagnostic imaging systems as well as new ground breaking in-vivo imaging.
21510_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	Scientific research and government programs We are widely recognized as a technology innovator and the scientific market has historically provided an ideal "test market" for our leading-edge innovations.
21510_17_ITEM1_P48_S1	These have included ultrafast lasers, DPSS lasers, continuous-wave ("CW") systems, excimer gas lasers and water-cooled ion gas lasers.
21510_17_ITEM1_P48_S2	Our portfolio of lasers that address the scientific research market is broad and includes our Chameleon, Chameleon Discovery, COMPexPro, Astrella, Revolution, Fidelity, Legend, Libra, Monaco, Vitara, Mephisto, Mira, Genesis and Verdi lasers.
21510_17_ITEM1_P48_S3	Many of the innovations and products pioneered in the scientific marketplace have become commercial successes for both our OEM customers and us.
21510_17_ITEM1_P48_S4	We have a large installed base of scientific lasers which are used in a wide range of applications spanning virtually every branch of science and engineering.
21510_17_ITEM1_P48_S5	These applications include biology and life science, engineering, physical chemistry and physics.
21510_17_ITEM1_P48_S6	Most of these applications require the use of ultrafast lasers that enable the generation of pulses short enough to be measured in femto- or attoseconds (10 -15 to 10 -18 seconds).
21510_17_ITEM1_P48_S7	Because of these very short pulse durations, ultrafast lasers enable the study of fundamental physical and chemical processes with temporal resolution unachievable with any other tool.
21510_17_ITEM1_P48_S8	These lasers also deliver very high peak power and large bandwidths, which can be used to generate many exotic effects.
21510_17_ITEM1_P48_S9	Some of these are now finding their way into mainstream applications, such as microscopy or materials processing.
21510_17_ITEM1_P48_S10	The use of ultrafast lasers such as the Chameleon, Fidelity and Monaco in microscopy is now a common occurrence in bio-imaging labs, and they have become a crucial tool in modern neuroscience research.
21510_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	Lasers are widely used in mass production microelectronics applications largely because they enable entirely new application capabilities that cannot be realized by any other known means.
21510_17_ITEM1_P49_S1	These laser-based fabrication and testing methods provide a level of precision, typically on a micrometer and nanometer level, that are unique, faster, are touch free, deliver superior end products, increase yields, and/or reduce production costs.
21510_17_ITEM1_P49_S2	We anticipate this trend to continue, driven primarily by the increasing sophistication and miniaturization of consumer electronic goods and their convergence via the internet, resulting in increasing demand for better displays, more bandwidth and memory, and all packaged into devices which are lighter, thinner and consume less power.

21510_17_ITEM1_P88_S8	While we have generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained on reasonable terms in the future or at all.
21510_17_ITEM1_P88_S9	For a discussion of the importance to our business of, and the risks attendant to intellectual property rights, see "Risk Factors" in Item 1A "We may not be able to protect our proprietary technology which could adversely affect our competitive advantage" and "We may, in the future, be subject to claims or litigation from third parties, for claims of infringement of their proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of competitors or other rights holders.
21510_17_ITEM1_P88_S10	These claims could result in costly litigation and the diversion of our technical and management personnel.
21510_17_ITEM1_P89_S0	COMPETITION Competition in the various photonics markets in which we provide products is very intense.
21510_17_ITEM1_P89_S1	We compete against a number of large public and private companies including Novanta Inc., IPG Photonics Corporation, Lumentum Holdings Inc., MKS Instruments, Inc., and TRUMPF GmbH, as well as other smaller companies.
21510_17_ITEM1_P89_S2	In addition, from time to time our customers may also decide to vertically integrate and build their own photonics products.
21510_17_ITEM1_P89_S3	We compete globally based on our broad product offering, reliability, cost, and performance advantages for the widest range of commercial and scientific research applications.
21510_17_ITEM1_P89_S4	Other considerations by our customers include warranty, global service and support and distribution.
21510_17_ITEM1_P89_S5	At fiscal 2017 year-end, our backlog of orders scheduled for shipment (within one year) was $1,040.0 million compared to $605.3 million at fiscal 2016 year-end.
21510_17_ITEM1_P89_S6	By segment, backlog for OLS was $801.4 million and $558.6 million , respectively, at fiscal 2017 and 2016 year-ends.
21510_17_ITEM1_P89_S7	Backlog for ILS was $238.6 million and $46.7 million , respectively, at fiscal 2017 and 2016 year-ends.
21510_17_ITEM1_P89_S8	The increase in OLS backlog from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017 year-end is primarily due to the timing of large excimer laser annealing system orders, net of shipments, for the flat panel display market.
21510_17_ITEM1_P89_S9	The increase in ILS backlog from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017 year-end is primarily due to the acquisition of Rofin in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and is primarily concentrated on orders in the materials processing and high power fiber laser markets.
21510_17_ITEM1_P89_S10	Orders used to compute backlog are generally cancelable and, depending on the notice period, are subject to rescheduling by our customers with penalties.
21510_17_ITEM1_P89_S11	Historically, we have not experienced a significant rate of cancellation or rescheduling, though we cannot guarantee that the rate of cancellations or rescheduling will not increase in the future.
21510_17_ITEM1_P90_S0	SEASONALITY We have historically experienced decreased revenue in the first fiscal quarter compared to other quarters in our fiscal year due to the impact of time off and business closures at our facilities and those of many of our customers due to year-end holidays.
21510_17_ITEM1_P90_S1	For example over the past 10 years, excluding certain recovery years, our first fiscal quarter revenues have ranged 2%-12% below the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal years.
21510_17_ITEM1_P90_S2	With the acquisition of Rofin in fiscal 2017, we expect a more pronounced decrease in revenues in the first quarter of the fiscal year as Rofin has historically experienced more pronounced seasonality, particularly in materials processing applications, than Coherent historically has experienced.
21510_17_ITEM1_P90_S3	This historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's future net sales or financial performance.
21510_17_ITEM1_P91_S0	As of fiscal 2017 year-end, we had 5,218 employees.
21510_17_ITEM1_P91_S1	Approximately 666 of our employees are involved in research and development; 3,382 of our employees are involved in operations, manufacturing, service and quality assurance; and 1,170 of our employees are involved in sales, order administration, marketing, finance, information technology, general management and other administrative functions.
21510_17_ITEM1_P91_S2	Our success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain employees.
21510_17_ITEM1_P91_S3	We face competition in this regard from other companies, research and academic institutions, government entities and other organizations.
21510_17_ITEM1_P91_S4	We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
21510_17_ITEM1_P92_S0	On November 7, 2016, we acquired Rofin, one of the world's leading developers and manufacturers of high-performance industrial laser sources and laser-based solutions and components, for approximately $936.3 million .
21510_17_ITEM1_P92_S1	Rofin's operating results have been included primarily in our Industrial Lasers Systems segment.
21510_17_ITEM1_P92_S2	See "Recent Developments" for further discussion of the acquisition and the Credit Agreement.
21510_17_ITEM1_P93_S0	In July 2015, we acquired certain assets of Raydiance, Inc. ("Raydiance") for approximately $5.0 million, excluding transaction costs.
21510_17_ITEM1_P94_S0	Raydiance manufactured complete tools and lasers for ultrafast processing systems and subsystems in the precision micromachining processing market.
21510_17_ITEM1_P94_S1	The Raydiance assets have been included in our OEM Laser Sources segment.
21510_17_ITEM1_P94_S2	In July 2015, we acquired the assets and certain liabilities of the Tinsley Optics ("Tinsley") business from L-3 Communications Corporation for approximately $4.3 million, excluding transaction costs.
21510_17_ITEM1_P95_S0	Tinsley is a specialized manufacturer of high precision optical components and subsystems sold primarily in the aerospace and defense industry.
21510_17_ITEM1_P95_S1	Tinsley manufactures the large form factor optics for our excimer laser annealing systems.
21510_17_ITEM1_P95_S2	The Tinsley assets have been included in our OEM Laser Sources segment.
21510_17_ITEM1_P95_S3	Business Combinations" of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of this annual report for further discussion of recent acquisitions completed.
21510_17_ITEM1_P96_S0	In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we began the implementation of planned restructuring activities in connection with the acquisition of Rofin.
21510_17_ITEM1_P96_S1	These activities to date primarily have related to exiting our legacy high power fiber laser product line, change of control payments to Rofin officers, the exiting of two product lines acquired in the acquisition of Rofin, realignment of our supply chain due to segment reorganization and consolidation of sales and distribution offices.
21510_17_ITEM1_P96_S2	These activities resulted in charges primarily for employee termination, other exit related costs associated with the write-off of property and equipment and inventory and early lease termination costs.
21510_17_ITEM1_P96_S3	The current year severance related costs are primarily comprised of severance pay for employees being terminated due to the transition of activities out of Rofin including change of control payments to Rofin officers and the exit from certain product lines as well as the consolidation of sales and distribution offices.
21510_17_ITEM1_P96_S4	The current year asset write-offs are primarily comprised of write-offs of inventory and equipment due to exiting our legacy high power fiber laser product line and inventory write-offs due to the exit of other Rofin product lines.
21510_17_ITEM1_P96_S5	We plan to continue additional restructuring activities in fiscal 2018 related to our acquisition of Rofin.
21510_17_ITEM1_P97_S0	Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, handling and disposal of regulated materials, chemicals, various radioactive materials and certain waste products.
21510_17_ITEM1_P97_S1	In the United States, we are subject to the federal regulation and control of the Environmental Protection Agency.
21510_17_ITEM1_P97_S2	Comparable authorities are involved in other countries.
21510_17_ITEM1_P98_S0	We expect all operations to meet the legal and regulatory environmental requirements and believe that compliance with those regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive and financial position.
21510_17_ITEM1_P98_S1	Although we believe that our safety procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of such materials comply with the standards required by federal and state laws and regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials.
21510_17_ITEM1_P98_S2	In the event of such an accident involving such materials, we could be liable for damages and such liability could exceed the amount of our liability insurance coverage and the resources of our business.
21510_17_ITEM1_P99_S0	We face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations due to the evolving nature of environmental compliance regulations and standards, as well as specific customer compliance requirements.
21510_17_ITEM1_P99_S1	These regulations and standards have an impact on the material composition of our products entering specific markets.
21510_17_ITEM1_P99_S2	Such legislation has gone into effect at various time across the worldwide markets.
21510_17_ITEM1_P99_S3	For example, in the European Union ("EU"), the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS) went into effect in 2006, and was subsequently revised in 2011 and again in 2015 (as RoHS 2).
21510_17_ITEM1_P99_S4	Another material revision will be in effect in 2019.
21510_17_ITEM1_P100_S0	The Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) went into effect in 2007, and is amended with additional substances every 6 months.
21510_17_ITEM1_P101_S0	China enacted the Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products Regulation (China-RoHS) in 2007, which was revised and renamed in 2016 as the Administrative Measures for the Restriction of the Use of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Products (known as China RoHS 2).
21510_17_ITEM1_P101_S1	Another example is the US Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Conflict Minerals Act) which requires manufacturers to provide disclosures about the use of specified conflict minerals emanating from the DRC and nine adjoining countries (Covered Countries).
21510_17_ITEM1_P102_S0	In addition to these regulations and directives, we may face costs and liabilities in connection with product take-back legislation.
21510_17_ITEM1_P102_S1	For example, beginning in 2006 (with several subsequent revisions), the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive 2012/19/EU made producers of electrical goods financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products.
21510_17_ITEM1_P102_S2	Similar laws are now pending in various jurisdictions around the world, including the United States.
21510_17_ITEM1_P103_S0	Environmental liabilities Our operations are subject to various laws and regulations governing the environment, including the discharge of pollutants and the management and disposal of hazardous substances.
21510_17_ITEM1_P103_S1	As a result of our historic as well as on-going operations, we could incur substantial costs, including remediation costs.
21510_17_ITEM1_P103_S2	The costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to predict.
21510_17_ITEM1_P103_S3	Our accruals for such costs and liabilities may not be adequate because the estimates on which the accruals are based depend on a number of factors including the nature of the matter, the complexity of the site, site geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) at multi-party sites and the number and financial viability of other PRPs.
21510_17_ITEM1_P104_S0	Regulatory Compliance Certain of our lasers sold in the United States are classified as Class IV Laser Products under the applicable rules and regulations of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health ("CDRH") of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA").
21510_17_ITEM1_P104_S1	A similar classification system is applied in the European markets.
21510_17_ITEM1_P105_S0	CDRH regulations require a self-certification procedure pursuant to which a manufacturer must submit a filing to the CDRH with respect to each product incorporating a laser device, make periodic reports of sales and purchases and comply with product labeling standards, product safety and design features and informational requirements.
21510_17_ITEM1_P105_S1	The CDRH is empowered to seek fines and other remedies for violations of their requirements.
21510_17_ITEM1_P106_S0	We believe that our products are in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to the manufacture of laser devices.
21510_17_ITEM1_P107_S0	SEGMENT INFORMATION As a result of the acquisition of Rofin in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we reorganized our prior two reporting segments (Specialty Laser Systems and Commercial Lasers and Components) into two new reporting segments for the combined company based upon the organizational structure of the combined company and how the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") receives and utilizes information provided to allocate resources and make decisions: OEM Laser Sources ( OLS ) and Industrial Lasers Systems ( ILS ).
21510_17_ITEM1_P107_S1	Accordingly, our segment information was restated retroactively for all periods presented.
21510_17_ITEM1_P107_S2	This segmentation reflects the go-to-market strategies and synergies for our broad portfolio of laser technologies and products.
21510_17_ITEM1_P108_S0	diagnostics and therapeutic medical applications, as well as in scientific research.
21510_17_ITEM1_P109_S0	Our ILS business segment delivers high performance laser sources, sub-systems and tools primarily used for industrial laser materials processing, serving important end markets like automotive, machine tool, consumer goods and medical device manufacturing.
21510_17_ITEM1_P109_S1	Rofin's operating results have been included primarily in our Industrial Lasers Systems segment.
21510_17_ITEM1_P110_S0	We have identified OLS and ILS as operating segments for which discrete financial information was available.
21510_17_ITEM1_P110_S1	Both units have dedicated engineering, manufacturing, product business management and product line management functions.
21510_17_ITEM1_P111_S0	A small portion of our outside revenue is attributable to projects and recently developed products for which a segment has not yet been determined.
21510_17_ITEM1_P112_S0	The associated direct and indirect costs are presented in the category of Corporate and other, along with other corporate costs.
21510_17_ITEM1_P113_S0	FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND EXPORT SALES Financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations for fiscal years 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , is set forth in Note 15, "Segment and Geographic Information" of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of this annual report.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We may not be able to integrate the business of Rofin successfully with our own, realize the anticipated benefits of the merger or manage our expanded operations, any of which would adversely affect our results of operations.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We have devoted, and expect to continue to devote, significant management attention and resources to integrating our business practices with those of Rofin.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Such integration efforts are costly due to the large number of processes, policies, procedures, locations, operations, technologies and systems to be integrated, including purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, service, operations, payroll, pricing, marketing and employee benefits.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Integration expenses could, particularly in the short term, exceed the savings we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale, which could result in significant charges to earnings that we cannot currently quantify.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Potential difficulties that we may encounter as part of the integration process include the following:
21510_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, our business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures or policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger, or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Following the merger, the size and complexity of the business of the combined company has increased significantly.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage this expanded business, which will pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P2_S2	There can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected synergies and benefits anticipated from the merger.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Charges to earnings resulting from the application of the purchase method of accounting to the Rofin acquisition may adversely affect our results of operations.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P2_S4	In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we have accounted for the Rofin acquisition using the purchase method of accounting, which will result in charges to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock following completion of the acquisition.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Under the purchase method of accounting, we allocated the total purchase price of Rofin s net tangible and identifiable intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	The excess of the purchase price over net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We are and will continue to incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P3_S3	In addition, to the extent the value of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives becomes impaired, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P3_S4	These depreciation, amortization and potential impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our indebtedness following the merger is substantially greater than our indebtedness prior to the merger.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	This increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect us, including by decreasing our business flexibility, and will increase our borrowing costs.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	In November 2016 we entered into the Credit Agreement which provided for a 670 million Euro term loan, all of which was drawn, and a $100 million revolving credit facility, under which a 10 million Euro letter of credit was issued.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	As of September 30, 2017, 513.3 million Euros were outstanding under the term loan and 10.0 million Euros were outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P5_S2	We may incur additional indebtedness in the future by accessing the revolving credit facility and/or entering into new financing arrangements.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal of our current indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations and the ongoing interest rate environment.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P5_S4	There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, including covenants regarding the payment of taxes and other obligations, maintenance of insurance, reporting requirements and compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and negative covenants, including covenants limiting the ability of us and our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur debt, grant liens, make investments, make certain restricted payments, transact with affiliates, and sell assets.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The Credit Agreement also requires us and our subsidiaries to maintain a senior secured net leverage ratio as of the last day of each fiscal quarter of less of than or equal to 3.50 to 1.00.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default that include, among other things, payment defaults, cross defaults with certain other indebtedness, violation of covenants, inaccuracy of representations and warranties in any material respect, change in control of us and Coherent Holding BV Co. K.G. (formerly Coherent Holding GmbH), judgment defaults, and bankruptcy and insolvency events.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	If an event of default exists, the lenders may require the immediate payment of all obligations and exercise certain other rights and remedies provided for under the Credit Agreement, the other loan documents and applicable law.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P7_S2	The acceleration of such obligations is automatic upon the occurrence of a bankruptcy and insolvency event of default.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P7_S3	There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources or we will be able to arrange financing to repay our borrowings at such time.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Our substantially increased indebtedness and higher debt-to-equity ratio following completion of the merger in comparison to that prior to the merger will have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and will increase our borrowing costs.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P7_S5	In addition, the amount of cash required to service our increased indebtedness levels and thus the demands on our cash resources will be greater than the amount of cash flows required to service our indebtedness or that of Rofin individually prior to the merger.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P7_S6	The increased levels of indebtedness could also reduce funds available for our investments in product development as well as capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases and other activities and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P7_S7	BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND INDUSTRY TRENDS Our operating results, including net sales, net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA in dollars and as a percentage of net sales, as well as our stock price have varied in the past, and our future operating results will continue to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations based upon numerous factors, including those discussed in this Item 1A and throughout this report.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P7_S8	Our stock price will continue to be subject to daily variations as well.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P7_S9	Our future operating results and stock price may not follow any past trends or meet our guidance and expectations.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P7_S10	Our net sales and operating results, such as adjusted EBITDA percentage, net income (loss) and operating expenses, and our stock price have varied in the past and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year in the future.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P7_S11	We believe a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, could cause these variations and make them difficult to predict, including:
21510_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	distraction of management related to acquisition, integration or divestment activities.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	In addition, we often recognize a substantial portion of our sales in the last month of our fiscal quarters.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Our expenses for any given quarter are typically based on expected sales and if sales are below expectations in any given quarter, the adverse impact of the shortfall on our operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P8_S3	We also base our manufacturing on our forecasted product mix for the quarter.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P8_S4	If the actual product mix varies significantly from our forecast, we may not be able to fill some orders during that quarter, which would result in delays in the shipment of our products.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Accordingly, variations in timing of sales, particularly for our higher priced, higher margin products, can cause significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P8_S6	Due to these and other factors, such as varying product mix, we believe that quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year comparisons of our historical operating results may not be meaningful.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P8_S7	You should not rely on our results for any quarter or year as an indication of our future performance.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P8_S8	Our operating results in future quarters and years may be below public market analysts' or investors' expectations, which would likely cause the price of our stock to fall.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P8_S9	In addition, over the past several years, U.S. and global equity markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the stock prices of many technology companies both in and outside our industry.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P8_S10	There has not always been a direct correlation between this volatility and the performance of particular companies subject to these stock price fluctuations.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P8_S11	These factors, as well as general economic and political conditions or investors' concerns regarding the credibility of corporate financial statements, may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our stock in the future.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P8_S12	We depend on sole source or limited source suppliers, both internal and external, for some of the key components and materials, including exotic materials, certain cutting-edge optics and crystals, used in our products, which make us susceptible to supply shortages or price fluctuations that could adversely affect our business, particularly our ability to meet our customers' delivery requirements.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We currently purchase several key components and materials used in the manufacture of our products from sole source or limited source suppliers, both internal and external.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	In particular, from time-to-time our customers require us to ramp up production and/or accelerate delivery schedules of our products.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Our key suppliers may not have the ability to increase their production in line with our customers demands.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P9_S3	This can become acute during times of high growth in our customers businesses.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Our failure to timely receive these key components and materials would likely cause delays in the shipment of our products, which would likely negatively impact both our customers and our business.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Some of these suppliers are relatively small private companies that may discontinue their operations at any time and which may be particularly susceptible to prevailing economic conditions.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Some of our suppliers are located in regions which may be susceptible to natural disasters, such as the flooding in Thailand and the earthquake, tsunami and resulting nuclear disaster in Japan and severe flooding and power loss in the Eastern part of the United States in recent years.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	For certain long-lead time supplies or in order to lock-in pricing, we may be obligated to place non-cancelable purchase orders or otherwise assume liability for a large amount of the ordered supplies, which limits our ability to adjust down our inventory liability in the event of market downturns or other customer cancellations or rescheduling of their purchase orders for our products.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Some of our products, particularly in the flat panel display industry, require designs and specifications that are at the cutting-edge of available technologies and change frequently to meet rapidly evolving market demands.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	By their very nature, the types of components used in such products can be difficult and unpredictable to manufacture and may only be available from a single supplier, which increases the risk that we may not obtain such components in a timely manner.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Identifying alternative sources of supply for certain components could be difficult and costly, result in management distraction in assisting our current and future suppliers to meet our and our customers' technical requirements, and cause delays in shipments of our products while we identify, evaluate and test the products of alternative suppliers.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Any such delay in shipment would result in a delay or cancelation of our ability to convert such order into revenues.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Furthermore, financial or other difficulties faced by these suppliers or significant changes in demand for these components or materials could limit their availability.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P12_S5	We continue to consolidate our supply base and move supplier locations.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P12_S6	When we transition locations we may increase our inventory of such products as a safety stock during the transition, which may cause the amount of inventory reflected on our balance sheet to increase.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P12_S7	Additionally, many of our customers rely on sole source suppliers.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P12_S8	In the event of a disruption of our customers' supply chain, orders from our customers could decrease or be delayed.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P12_S9	Any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these components or materials, or the inability to obtain these components and materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time, or our failure to properly manage these moves, would impair our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and could cause customers to cancel orders.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We have historically relied exclusively on our own production capability to manufacture certain strategic components, crystals, semiconductor lasers, fiber, lasers and laser-based systems.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	In July 2015, we also began manufacturing certain large format optics.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Because we manufacture, package and test these components, products and systems at our own facilities, and such components, products and systems are not readily available from other sources, any interruption in manufacturing would adversely affect our business.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Since many of our products have lengthy qualification periods, our ability to introduce multiple suppliers for parts may be limited.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P13_S4	In addition, our failure to achieve adequate manufacturing yields of these items at our manufacturing facilities may materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P13_S5	We participate in the microelectronics market, which requires significant research and development expenses to develop and maintain products and a failure to achieve market acceptance for our products could have a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P13_S6	The microelectronics market is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product introductions, the volatility of product supply and demand, changing customer requirements and evolving industry standards.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P13_S7	The nature of this market requires significant research and development expenses to participate, with substantial resources invested in advance of material sales of our products to our customers in this market.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P13_S8	Additionally, our product offerings may become obsolete given the frequent introduction of alternative technologies.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P13_S9	In the event either our customers' or our products fail to gain market acceptance, or the microelectronics market fails to grow, it would likely have a significant negative effect on our business and results of operations.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We participate in the flat panel display market, which has a relatively limited number of end customer manufacturers.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Our backlog, timing of net sales and results of operations could be negatively impacted in the event our customers reschedule or cancel orders.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	In the flat panel display market, there are a relatively limited number of manufacturers who are the end customers for our annealing products.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In fiscal 2017, Advanced Process Systems Corporation, an integrator in the flat panel display market based in South Korea, contributed more than 10% of our revenue.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Given macroeconomic conditions, varying consumer demand and technical process limitations at manufacturers, our customers may seek to reschedule or cancel orders.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	These larger flat panel-related systems have large average selling prices.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Any rescheduling or canceling of such orders by our customers will likely have a significant impact on our quarterly or annual net sales and results of operations and could negatively impact inventory values and backlog.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Additionally, challenges in meeting evolving technological requirements for these complex products by us and our suppliers could also result in delays in shipments and rescheduled or canceled orders by our customers.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P16_S4	This could negatively impact our backlog, timing of net sales and results of operations.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P16_S5	As of September 30, 2017 , flat panel display systems represented 59% of our backlog, compared to 63% at October 1, 2016.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P16_S6	Since our backlog includes higher average selling price flat panel display systems, any delays or cancellation of shipments could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Some of our laser systems are complex in design and may contain defects that are not detected until deployed by our customers, which could increase our costs and reduce our net sales.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Lasers and laser systems are inherently complex in design and require ongoing regular maintenance.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The manufacture of our lasers, laser products and systems involves a highly complex and precise process.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P18_S2	As a result of the technological complexity of our products, in particular our excimer laser annealing tools (ELA) used in the flat panel display market, changes in our or our suppliers' manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective materials by us or our suppliers could result in a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and product reliability.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P18_S3	To the extent that we do not achieve and maintain our projected yields or product reliability, our business, operating results, financial condition and customer relationships would be adversely affected.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P18_S4	We provide warranties on a majority of our product sales, and reserves for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P18_S5	The determination of such reserves requires us to make estimates of failure rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P18_S6	We typically establish warranty reserves based on historical warranty costs for each product line.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P18_S7	If actual return rates and/or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates, adjustments to cost of sales may be required in future periods which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P18_S8	Our customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated, including under the end user's peak stress conditions.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P18_S9	In addition, some of our products are combined with products from other vendors, which may contain defects.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P18_S10	As a result, should problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P18_S11	If we are unable to identify and fix defects or other problems, we could experience, among other things:
21510_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	legal actions by our customers and/or their end users.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Continued volatility in the advanced packaging and semiconductor manufacturing markets could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P19_S3	A portion of our net sales in the microelectronics market depends on the demand for our products by advanced packaging applications and semiconductor equipment companies.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P19_S4	These markets have historically been characterized by sudden and severe cyclical variations in product supply and demand, which have often severely affected the demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment, including laser-based tools and systems.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P19_S5	The timing, severity and duration of these market cycles are difficult to predict, and we may not be able to respond effectively to these cycles.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P19_S6	The continuing uncertainty in these markets severely limits our ability to predict our business prospects or financial results in these markets.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P19_S7	During industry downturns, our net sales from these markets may decline suddenly and significantly.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P19_S8	Our ability to rapidly and effectively reduce our cost structure in response to such downturns is limited by the fixed nature of many of our expenses in the near term and by our need to continue our investment in next-generation product technology and to support and service our products.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P19_S9	In addition, due to the relatively long manufacturing lead times for some of the systems and subsystems we sell to these markets, we may incur expenditures or purchase raw materials or components for products we cannot sell.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P19_S10	Accordingly, downturns in the semiconductor capital equipment market may materially harm our operating results.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P19_S11	Conversely, when upturns in these markets occur, we must be able to rapidly and effectively increase our manufacturing capacity to meet increases in customer demand that may be extremely rapid, and if we fail to do so we may lose business to our competitors and our relationships with our customers may be harmed.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Worldwide economic conditions and related uncertainties could negatively impact demand for our products and results of operations.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets, depressed consumer confidence, government economic policies, negative economic conditions, volatile corporate profits and reduced capital spending could negatively impact demand for our products.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	of some of our suppliers to continue operations and provide us with uninterrupted supply flow.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Our ability to maintain our research and development investments in our broad product offerings may be adversely impacted in the event that our future sales decline or remain flat.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Spending and the timing thereof by consumers and businesses have a significant impact on our results and, where such spending is delayed or canceled, it could have a material negative impact on our operating results.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Current global economic conditions remain uncertain and challenging.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Weakness in our end markets could negatively impact our net sales, gross margin and operating expenses, and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Uncertainty in global fiscal policy has likely had an adverse impact on global financial markets and overall economic activity in recent years.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Should this uncertain financial policy recur, it would likely negatively impact global economic activity.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Any weakness in global economies would also likely have negative repercussions on U.S. and global credit and financial markets, and further exacerbate sovereign debt concerns in the European Union.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P23_S3	All of these factors would likely adversely impact the global demand for our products and the performance of our investments, and would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The financial turmoil that has affected the banking system and financial markets in recent years could result in tighter credit markets and lower levels of liquidity in some financial markets.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	There could be a number of follow-on effects from a tightened credit environment on our business, including the insolvency of key suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and/or manufacture products resulting in product delays; inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and/or customer insolvencies; and failure of financial institutions negatively impacting our treasury functions.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P24_S2	In the event our customers are unable to obtain credit or otherwise pay for our shipped products it could significantly impact our ability to collect on our outstanding accounts receivable.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments; impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments; interest rates; cash balances; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Volatility in the financial markets and any overall economic uncertainty increase the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P24_S5	Uncertainty about current global economic conditions could also continue to increase the volatility of our stock price.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P24_S6	In addition, political and social turmoil related to international conflicts, terrorist acts, civil unrest and mass migration may put further pressure on economic conditions in the United States and the rest of the world.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P24_S7	Unstable economic, political and social conditions make it difficult for our customers, our suppliers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P24_S8	If such conditions persist, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P24_S9	Additionally, unstable economic conditions can provide significant pressures and burdens on individuals, which could cause them to engage in inappropriate business conduct.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P24_S10	See Part II, Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are managed through various banks around the world and volatility in the capital and credit market conditions could cause financial institutions to fail or materially harm service levels provided by such banks, both of which could have an adverse impact on our ability to timely access funds.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	World capital and credit markets have been and may continue to experience volatility and disruption.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P25_S2	In some cases, the markets have exerted downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers, as well as pressured the solvency of some financial institutions.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P25_S3	These financial institutions, including banks, have had difficulty timely performing regular services and in some cases have failed or otherwise been largely taken over by governments.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We maintain our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments with a number of financial institutions around the world.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Should some or all of these financial institutions fail or otherwise be unable to timely perform requested services, we would likely have a limited ability to timely access our cash deposited with such institutions, or, in extreme circumstances the failure of such institutions could cause us to be unable to access cash for the foreseeable future.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P26_S2	If we are unable to quickly access our funds when we need them, we may need to increase the use of our existing credit lines or access more expensive credit, if available.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P26_S3	If we are unable to access our cash or if we access existing or additional credit or are unable to access additional credit, it could have a negative impact on our operations, including our reported net income.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P26_S4	In addition, the willingness of financial institutions to continue to accept our cash deposits will impact our ability to diversify our investment risk among institutions.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P26_S5	We are exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P26_S6	Although we have not recognized any material losses on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, future declines in their market values could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Given the global nature of our business, we have investments both domestically and internationally.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	There has recently been growing pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, particularly in Europe where a significant portion of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are invested, which results in corresponding pressure on the valuation of the securities issued by such nations.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	as U.S. Treasury securities and government agencies, corporate notes, commercial paper and money market funds.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, financial results, or other factors.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Additionally, liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations could result in decreased values for our investments in certain government securities.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P29_S3	As a result, the value or liquidity of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments could decline or become materially impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P29_S4	See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our future success depends on our ability to increase our sales volumes and decrease our costs to offset potential declines in the average selling prices ( ASPs ) of our products and, if we are unable to realize greater sales volumes and lower costs, our operating results may suffer.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Our ability to increase our sales volume and our future success depends on the continued growth of the markets for lasers, laser systems and related accessories, as well as our ability to identify, in advance, emerging markets for laser-based systems and to manage our manufacturing capacity to meet customer demands.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P30_S2	We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify, on a timely basis, new high-growth markets in the future.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Moreover, we cannot assure you that new markets will develop for our products or our customers' products, or that our technology or pricing will enable such markets to develop.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Future demand for our products is uncertain and will depend to a great degree on continued technological development and the introduction of new or enhanced products.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P30_S5	If this does not continue, sales of our products may decline and our business will be harmed.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P30_S6	We have in the past experienced decreases in the ASPs of some of our products.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P30_S7	As competing products become more widely available, the ASPs of our products may decrease.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P30_S8	If we are unable to offset any decrease in our ASPs by increasing our sales volumes, our net sales will decline.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P30_S9	In addition, to maintain our gross margins, we must continue to reduce the cost of manufacturing our products while maintaining their high quality.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	From time to time, our products, like many complex technological products, may fail in greater frequency than anticipated.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	This can lead to further charges, which can result in higher costs, lower gross margins and lower operating results.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Furthermore, as ASPs of our current products decline, we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements with higher margins.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P31_S3	If we cannot maintain our gross margins, our operating results could be seriously harmed, particularly if the ASPs of our products decrease significantly.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Our future success depends on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new and enhanced products that meet the needs of our customers.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P31_S5	Our current products address a broad range of commercial and scientific research applications in the photonics markets.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P31_S6	We cannot assure you that the market for these applications will continue to generate significant or consistent demand for our products.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P31_S7	Demand for our products could be significantly diminished by disrupting technologies or products that replace them or render them obsolete.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P31_S8	Furthermore, the new and enhanced products in certain markets generally continue to be smaller in size and have lower ASPs, and therefore, we have to sell more units to maintain revenue levels.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P31_S9	Accordingly, we must continue to invest in research and development in order to develop competitive products.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P31_S10	Our future success depends on our ability to anticipate our customers' needs and develop products that address those needs.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P31_S11	Introduction of new products and product enhancements will require that we effectively transfer production processes from research and development to manufacturing and coordinate our efforts with those of our suppliers to achieve volume production rapidly.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P31_S12	If we fail to transfer production processes effectively, develop product enhancements or introduce new products in sufficient quantities to meet the needs of our customers as scheduled, our net sales may be reduced and our business may be harmed.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P31_S13	We face risks associated with our foreign operations and sales that could harm our financial condition and results of operations.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P31_S14	For fiscal 2017 , fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 , 83% , 76% and 73% , respectively, of our net sales were derived from customers outside of the United States.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P31_S15	We anticipate that foreign sales, particularly in Asia, will continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales in the foreseeable future.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P31_S16	A global economic slowdown or a natural disaster could have a negative effect on various foreign markets in which we operate, such as the earthquake, tsunami and resulting nuclear disaster in Japan and the flooding in Thailand in recent years.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P31_S17	Such a slowdown may cause us to reduce our presence in certain countries, which may negatively affect the overall level of business in such countries.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our foreign sales are primarily through our direct sales force.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Additionally, some foreign sales are made through foreign distributors and representatives.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Our foreign operations and sales are subject to a number of risks, including:
21510_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our business could also be impacted by international conflicts, terrorist and military activity including, in particular, any such conflicts on the Korean peninsula, civil unrest and pandemic illness which could cause a slowdown in customer orders, cause customer order cancellations or negatively impact availability of supplies or limit our ability to timely service our installed base of products.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We are also subject to the risks of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, which could materially adversely affect the sales price of our products in foreign markets, as well as the costs and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P33_S2	While we use forward exchange contracts and other risk management techniques to hedge our foreign currency exposure, we remain exposed to the economic risks of foreign currency fluctuations.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P33_S3	If we are unable able to protect our proprietary technology, our competitive advantage could be harmed.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Maintenance of intellectual property rights and the protection thereof is important to our business.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P33_S5	We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P33_S6	Our patent applications may not be approved, any patents that may be issued may not sufficiently protect our intellectual property and any issued patents may be challenged by third parties.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P33_S7	Other parties may independently develop similar or competing technology or design around any patents that may be issued to us.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P33_S8	We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P33_S9	Further, we may be required to enforce our intellectual property or other proprietary rights through litigation, which, regardless of success, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management's attention.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P33_S10	Additionally, there may be existing patents of which we are unaware that could be pertinent to our business and it is not possible for us to know whether there are patent applications pending that our products might infringe upon since these applications are often not publicly available until a patent is issued or published.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P33_S11	We may, in the future, be subject to claims or litigation from third parties, for claims of infringement of their proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of competitors or other rights holders.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P33_S12	These claims could result in costly litigation and the diversion of our technical and management personnel.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P33_S13	Adverse resolution of litigation may harm our operating results or financial condition.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	In recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States and around the world involving patents and other intellectual property rights.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	This has been seen in our industry, for example in the concluded patent-related litigation between IMRA America, Inc. ("Imra") and IPG Photonics Corporation and in Imra's litigation against two of our German subsidiaries.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	From time to time, like many other technology companies, we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights, copyrights, trademark rights or other intellectual property rights which such third parties believe may cover certain of our products, processes, technologies or information.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	our intellectual property or as a result of an alleged infringement of others' intellectual property whether through direct claims or by way of indemnification claims of our customers, as, in some cases, we contractually agree to indemnify our customers against third-party infringement claims relating to our products.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P36_S1	These claims and any resulting lawsuit, if successful, could subject us to significant liability for damages or invalidation of our proprietary rights.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P36_S2	These lawsuits, regardless of their success, would likely be time-consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Any potential intellectual property litigation could also force us to do one or more of the following:
21510_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	redesign the products that use the technology.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P37_S1	If we are forced to take any of these actions or are otherwise a party to lawsuits of this nature, we may incur significant losses and our business may be seriously harmed.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P37_S2	We do not have insurance to cover potential claims of this type.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P37_S3	If our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Factors that may be considered in determining whether a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable include declines in our stock price and market capitalization or future cash flows projections.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P38_S3	A decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in market conditions, particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we used to calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units, could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an impairment charge.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Any such material charges, whether related to goodwill or purchased intangible assets, may have a material negative impact on our financial and operating results.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P38_S5	We depend on skilled personnel to operate our business effectively in a rapidly changing market, and if we are unable to retain existing or hire additional personnel when needed, our ability to develop and sell our products could be harmed.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P38_S6	Our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel will be a critical factor in determining whether we will be successful in the future.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Recruiting and retaining highly skilled personnel in certain functions continues to be difficult.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P39_S1	At certain locations where we operate, the cost of living is extremely high and it may be difficult to retain key employees and management at a reasonable cost.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P39_S2	We may not be successful in attracting, assimilating or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs, which could adversely affect our growth and our business.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and support personnel, any of whom may leave and our ability to effectively transition to their successors.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P39_S4	Our inability to retain or to effectively transition to their successors could harm our business and our results of operations.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P39_S5	The long sales cycles for our products may cause us to incur significant expenses without offsetting net sales.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P39_S6	Customers often view the purchase of our products as a significant and strategic decision.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P39_S7	As a result, customers typically expend significant effort in evaluating, testing and qualifying our products before making a decision to purchase them, resulting in a lengthy initial sales cycle.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P39_S8	While our customers are evaluating our products and before they place an order with us, we may incur substantial sales and marketing and research and development expenses to customize our products to the customers' needs.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P39_S9	We may also expend significant management efforts, increase manufacturing capacity and order long lead-time components or materials prior to receiving an order.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P39_S10	Even after this evaluation process, a potential customer may not purchase our products.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P39_S11	As a result, these long sales cycles may cause us to incur significant expenses without ever receiving net sales to offset such expenses.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The markets in which we sell our products are intensely competitive and increased competition could cause reduced sales levels, reduced gross margins or the loss of market share.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Competition in the various photonics markets in which we provide products is very intense.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P40_S2	We compete against a number of large public and private companies, including Novanta Inc., IPG Photonics Corporation, Lumentum Holdings Inc., MKS Instruments, Inc. and TRUMPF GmbH, as well as other smaller companies.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Some of our competitors are large companies that have significant financial, technical, marketing and other resources.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P40_S4	These competitors may be able to devote greater resources than we can to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Any of these acquisitions could give our competitors a strategic advantage.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Any business combinations or mergers among our competitors, forming larger companies with greater resources, could result in increased competition, price reductions, reduced margins or loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Additional competitors may enter the markets in which we serve, both foreign and domestic, and we are likely to compete with new companies in the future.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P41_S3	We may encounter potential customers that, due to existing relationships with our competitors, are committed to the products offered by these competitors.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Further, our current or potential customers may determine to develop and produce products for their own use which are competitive to our products.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P41_S5	Such vertical integration could reduce the market opportunity for our products.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P41_S6	As a result of the foregoing factors, we expect that competitive pressures may result in price reductions, reduced margins, loss of sales and loss of market share.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P41_S7	In addition, in markets where there are a limited number of customers, competition is particularly intense.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P41_S8	If we fail to accurately forecast component and material requirements for our products, we could incur additional costs and incur significant delays in shipments, which could result in a loss of customers.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P41_S9	We use rolling forecasts based on anticipated product orders and material requirements planning systems to determine our product requirements.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P41_S10	It is very important that we accurately predict both the demand for our products and the lead times required to obtain the necessary components and materials.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P41_S11	We depend on our suppliers for most of our product components and materials.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P41_S12	Lead times for components and materials that we order vary significantly and depend on factors including the specific supplier requirements, the size of the order, contract terms and current market demand for components.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P41_S13	For substantial increases in our sales levels of certain products, some of our suppliers may need at least nine months lead-time.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P41_S14	If we overestimate our component and material requirements, we may have excess inventory, which would increase our costs.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P41_S15	If we underestimate our component and material requirements, we may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt and delay delivery of our products to our customers.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P41_S16	Any of these occurrences would negatively impact our net sales, business or operating results.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P41_S17	Our reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing may adversely impact our financial results and operations due to our decreased control over the performance and timing of certain aspects of our manufacturing.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P41_S18	Our manufacturing strategy includes partnering with contract manufacturers to outsource non-core subassemblies and less complex turnkey products, including some performed at international sites located in Asia and Eastern Europe.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P41_S19	Our ability to resume internal manufacturing operations for certain products and components in a timely manner may be eliminated.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P41_S20	The cost, quality, performance and availability of contract manufacturing operations are and will be essential to the successful production and sale of many of our products.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P41_S21	Our financial condition or results of operation could be adversely impacted if any contract manufacturer or other supplier is unable for any reason, including as a result of the impact of worldwide economic conditions, to meet our cost, quality, performance, and availability standards.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P41_S22	We may not be able to provide contract manufacturers with product volumes that are high enough to achieve sufficient cost savings.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P41_S23	If shipments fall below forecasted levels, we may incur increased costs or be required to take ownership of the inventory.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P41_S24	Also, our ability to control the quality of products produced by contract manufacturers may be limited and quality issues may not be resolved in a timely manner, which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P41_S25	If we fail to effectively manage our growth or, alternatively, our spending during downturns, our business could be disrupted, which could harm our operating results.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P41_S26	Growth in sales, combined with the challenges of managing geographically dispersed operations, can place a significant strain on our management systems and resources, and our anticipated growth in future operations could continue to place such a strain.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P41_S27	The failure to effectively manage our growth could disrupt our business and harm our operating results.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P41_S28	Our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in evolving markets requires an effective planning and management process.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P41_S29	In economic downturns, we must effectively manage our spending and operations to ensure our competitive position during the downturn, as well as our future opportunities when the economy improves, remain intact.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P41_S30	The failure to effectively manage our spending and operations could disrupt our business and harm our operating results.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Historically, acquisitions have been an important element of our strategy.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P42_S1	However, we may not find suitable acquisition candidates in the future and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Any acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P42_S3	We have in the past made strategic acquisitions of other corporations and entities, including Rofin in November 2016, as well as asset purchases, and we continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions of complementary companies, products and technologies.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P42_S4	In the event of any future acquisitions, we could:
21510_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	incur expenses related to impairment of goodwill and amortization.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Acquisitions also involve numerous risks, including:
21510_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	the failure to complete acquisitions even after signing definitive agreements which, among other things, would result in the expensing of potentially significant professional fees and other charges in the period in which the acquisition or negotiations are terminated.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P44_S1	We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify appropriate acquisition candidates, to integrate any businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future or achieve the anticipated benefits of such transactions, which may harm our business.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Our market is unpredictable and characterized by rapid technological changes and evolving standards demanding a significant investment in research and development, and, if we fail to address changing market conditions, our business and operating results will be harmed.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The photonics industry is characterized by extensive research and development, rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Because this industry is subject to rapid change, it is difficult to predict its potential size or future growth rate.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Our success in generating net sales in this industry will depend on, among other things:
21510_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	our ability to accurately predict and develop our products to meet industry standards.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P46_S1	For our fiscal years 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , our research and development costs were $119.2 million ( 6.9% of net sales), $81.8 million ( 9.5% of net sales) and $81.5 million ( 10.2% of net sales), respectively.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P46_S2	We cannot assure you that our expenditures for research and development will result in the introduction of new products or, if such products are introduced, that those products will achieve sufficient market acceptance or to generate sales to offset the costs of development.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Our failure to address rapid technological changes in our markets could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P46_S4	We are exposed to lawsuits in the normal course of business which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P46_S5	We are exposed to lawsuits in the normal course of our business, including product liability claims, if personal injury, death or commercial losses occur from the use of our products.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P46_S6	While we typically maintain business insurance, including directors' and officers' policies, litigation can be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations, including the potential impact of indemnification obligations for individuals named in any such lawsuits.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P46_S7	We may not, however, be able to secure insurance coverage on terms acceptable to us in the future.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	An unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit, including a recall or redesign of products if ultimately determined to be defective, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P47_S1	We use standard laboratory and manufacturing materials that could be considered hazardous and we could be liable for any damage or liability resulting from accidental environmental contamination or injury.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Although most of our products do not incorporate hazardous or toxic materials and chemicals, some of the gases used in our excimer lasers and some of the liquid dyes used in some of our scientific laser products are highly toxic.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P47_S3	In addition, our operations involve the use of standard laboratory and manufacturing materials that could be considered hazardous.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P47_S4	Also, if a facility fire were to occur at our Sunnyvale, California site and were to spread to a reactor used to grow semiconductor wafers, it could release highly toxic emissions.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P47_S5	We believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with all federal, state and offshore regulations and standards.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P47_S6	However, the risk of accidental environmental contamination or injury from such materials cannot be entirely eliminated.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P47_S7	In the event of such an accident involving such materials, we could be liable for damages and such liability could exceed the amount of our liability insurance coverage and the resources of our business which could have an adverse effect on our financial results or our business as a whole.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P47_S8	Compliance or the failure to comply with current and future environmental regulations could cause us significant expense.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process or requiring design changes or recycling of products we manufacture.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P48_S1	If we fail to comply with any present and future regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities, the suspension of production or a prohibition on the sale of products we manufacture.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P48_S2	In addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment, or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations, including expenses associated with the recall of any non-compliant product and the management of historical waste.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P48_S3	From time to time new regulations are enacted, and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P48_S4	We continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P48_S5	These regulations include, for example, the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical substances ( REACH ), the Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive ( RoHS ) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive ( WEEE ) enacted in the European Union which regulate the use of certain hazardous substances in, and require the collection, reuse and recycling of waste from, certain products we manufacture.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P48_S6	This and similar legislation that has been or is in the process of being enacted in Japan, China, South Korea and various states of the United States may require us to re-design our products to ensure compliance with the applicable standards, for example by requiring the use of different types of materials.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P48_S7	These redesigns or alternative materials may detrimentally impact the performance of our products, add greater testing lead-times for product introductions or have other similar effects.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P48_S8	We believe we comply with all such legislation where our products are sold and we will continue to monitor these laws and the regulations being adopted under them to determine our responsibilities.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P48_S9	In addition, we are monitoring legislation relating to the reduction of carbon emissions from industrial operations to determine whether we may be required to incur any additional material costs or expenses associated with our operations.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P48_S10	We are not currently aware of any such material costs or expenses.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The SEC has promulgated rules requiring disclosure regarding the use of certain conflict minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and procedures regarding a manufacturer's efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P49_S1	The implementation of such rules has required us to incur additional expense and internal resources and may continue to do so in the future, particularly in the event that only a limited pool of suppliers are available to certify that products are free from conflict minerals.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Our failure to comply with any of the foregoing regulatory requirements or contractual obligations could result in our being directly or indirectly liable for costs, fines or penalties and third-party claims, and could jeopardize our ability to conduct business in the United States and foreign countries.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P49_S3	Our and our customers' operations would be seriously harmed if our logistics or facilities or those of our suppliers, our customers' suppliers or our contract manufacturers were to experience catastrophic loss.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P49_S4	Our operations, logistics and facilities and those of our customers, suppliers and contract manufacturers could be subject to a catastrophic loss from fire, flood, earthquake, volcanic eruption, work stoppages, power outages, acts of war, pandemic illnesses, energy shortages, theft of assets, other natural disasters or terrorist activity.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	A substantial portion of our research and development activities, manufacturing, our corporate headquarters and other critical business operations are located near major earthquake faults in Santa Clara, California, an area with a history of seismic events.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Any such loss or detrimental impact to any of our operations, logistics or facilities could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and net sales and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P50_S2	While we have obtained insurance to cover most potential losses, after reviewing the costs and limitations associated with earthquake insurance, we have decided not to procure such insurance.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P50_S3	We believe that this decision is consistent with decisions reached by numerous other companies located nearby.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P50_S4	We cannot assure you that our existing insurance coverage will be adequate against all other possible losses.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Difficulties with our enterprise resource planning ( ERP ) system and other parts of our global information technology system could harm our business and results of operation.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P51_S1	If our network security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer's data or our data or our information technology systems, we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Like many modern multinational corporations, we maintain a global information technology system, including software products licensed from third parties.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Any system, network or Internet failures, misuse by system users, the hacking into or disruption caused by the unauthorized access by third parties or loss of license rights could disrupt our ability to timely and accurately manufacture and ship products or to report our financial information in compliance with the timelines mandated by the SEC.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Any such failure, misuse, hacking, disruptions or loss would likely cause a diversion of management's attention from the underlying business and could harm our operations.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P52_S3	In addition, a significant failure of our global information technology system could adversely affect our ability to complete an evaluation of our internal controls and attestation activities pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Our information systems are subject to attacks, interruptions and failures.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P53_S1	As part of our day-to-day business, we store our data and certain data about our customers in our global information technology system.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P53_S2	While our system is designed with access security, if a third party gains unauthorized access to our data, including any regarding our customers, such a security breach could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, loss of business, litigation and possible liability.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P53_S3	Our security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P53_S4	Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers' data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P53_S5	Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P53_S6	Any unauthorized access could result in a loss of confidence by our customers, damage our reputation, disrupt our business, lead to legal liability and negatively impact our future sales.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P53_S7	Additionally, such actions could result in significant costs associated with loss of our intellectual property, impairment of our ability to conduct our operations, rebuilding our network and systems, prosecuting and defending litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages or taking other remedial steps.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P53_S8	Changes in tax rates, tax liabilities or tax accounting rules could affect future results.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P54_S0	As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries and jurisdictions.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Significant judgment is required to determine our worldwide tax liabilities.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P54_S2	A number of factors may affect our future effective tax rates including, but not limited to:
21510_17_ITEM1A_P55_S0	the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P55_S1	As indicated above, we are engaged in discussions with various tax authorities regarding the appropriate level of profitability for Coherent entities and this may result in changes to our worldwide tax liabilities.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P55_S2	In addition, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) and other tax authorities.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P55_S3	We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P55_S4	Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P56_S0	From time to time the United States, foreign and state governments make substantive changes to tax rules and the application of rules to companies, including various announcements from the United States government potentially impacting our ability to defer taxes on international earnings.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P56_S1	For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act proposed by U.S. federal tax legislation would have a significant impact on the taxation of Coherent including the U.S. tax treatment of our foreign operations.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P56_S2	We are reviewing the potential changes to the tax laws and will revise our tax estimates to the extent the legislation is enacted.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Federal securities laws, rules and regulations, as well as the rules and regulations of self-regulatory organizations such as NASDAQ and the NYSE, require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures, impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements, set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers, chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P58_S1	These laws, rules and regulations have increased and will continue to increase the scope, complexity and cost of our corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices, which could harm our results of operations and divert management's attention from business operations.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P59_S1	New or changed laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P59_S2	As a result, their application in practice may evolve over time.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We are committed to maintaining high standards of ethics, corporate governance and public disclosure.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Complying with evolving interpretations of new or changed legal requirements may cause us to incur higher costs as we revise current practices, policies and procedures, and may divert management time and attention from revenue generating to compliance activities.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P60_S2	If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, our reputation may also be harmed.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P60_S3	Governmental regulations, including duties, affecting the import or export of products could negatively affect our net sales.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P61_S0	The United States and many foreign governments impose tariffs and duties on the import and export of products, including some of those which we sell.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P61_S1	In particular, given our worldwide operations, we pay duties on certain products when they are imported into the United States for repair work as well as on certain of our products which are manufactured by our foreign subsidiaries.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P61_S2	These products can be subject to a duty on the product value.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Additionally, the United States and various foreign governments have imposed tariffs, controls, export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies, especially encryption technology.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P61_S4	From time to time, government agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology, such as requiring the escrow and governmental recovery of private encryption keys.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P61_S5	Governmental regulation of encryption technology and regulation of imports or exports, or our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products, could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our net sales.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P61_S6	From time to time our duty calculations and payments are audited by government agencies.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P61_S7	For example, we were audited in South Korea for customs duties and value-added-tax for the period March 2009 to March 2014.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P61_S8	We were liable for additional payments, duties, taxes and penalties of $1.6 million, which we paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2016.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P61_S9	Any future assessments could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P61_S10	In addition, compliance with the directives of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls ( DDTC ) may result in substantial expenses and diversion of management.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P61_S11	Any failure to adequately address the directives of DDTC could result in civil fines or suspension or loss of our export privileges, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Failure to maintain effective internal controls may cause a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements or to cause us to delay filing our periodic reports with the SEC and adversely affect our stock price.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P63_S0	The SEC, as directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on Form 10-K that contain an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P63_S1	In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Although we test our internal control over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with the Section 404 requirements, our failure to maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements or a delay in our ability to timely file our periodic reports with the SEC, which ultimately could negatively impact our stock price.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P63_S3	Provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law, and our change of control severance plan may have anti-takeover effects that could prevent or delay a change in control.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P63_S4	Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition or make removal of incumbent directors or officers more difficult.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P63_S5	These provisions may discourage takeover attempts and bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P64_S0	establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.

21510_17_ITEM1A_P65_S1	These provisions of Delaware law also may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us without obtaining the prior approval of our board of directors, which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P66_S0	In addition, we have adopted a change of control severance plan, which provides for the payment of a cash severance benefit to each eligible employee based on the employee's position.
21510_17_ITEM1A_P66_S1	If a change of control occurs, our successor or acquirer will be required to assume and agree to perform all of our obligations under the change of control severance plan which may discourage potential acquirers or result in a lower stock price.

21510_17_ITEM6_P1_S0	* In November 2015, the FASB issued amended guidance that clarifies that in a classified statement of financial position, an entity shall classify deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent amounts.
21510_17_ITEM6_P1_S1	The new guidance supersedes ASC 740-10-45-5 which required the valuation allowance for a particular tax jurisdiction be allocated between current and noncurrent deferred tax assets for that tax jurisdiction on a pro rata basis.
21510_17_ITEM6_P1_S2	We elected to early adopt the standard retrospectively in fiscal 2016, which resulted in the reclassification of current deferred income tax assets to non-current deferred income tax assets and non-current deferred income tax liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015.

21510_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS Below is a summary of some of the quantitative performance indicators (as defined below) that are evaluated by management to assess our financial performance.
21510_17_ITEM7_P0_S1	Some of the indicators are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered as an alternative to any other measure for determining operating performance that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
21510_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	As previously announced, management determined that we would no longer present non-GAAP bookings data effective in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
21510_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	We were one of the few companies in the industry that provided bookings information, which we believe put us at a competitive disadvantage.
21510_17_ITEM7_P1_S2	In addition, our bookings volatility has and will continue to be high by virtue of the excimer laser annealing ("ELA") business where high average selling prices can cause large swings in bookings; these swings are not indicative of the long-term potential of the business.
21510_17_ITEM7_P1_S3	We believe this change will put more focus on our key performance metrics discussed below.
21510_17_ITEM7_P1_S4	Accordingly, we no longer provide bookings, book-to-bill ratio and related disclosure in our MD A.
21510_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	Definitions and analysis of these performance indicators are as follows: Net Sales Net sales include sales of lasers, laser tools, related accessories and service.
21510_17_ITEM7_P2_S1	Net sales for fiscal 2017 increased 58.3% in our OLS segment and increased 329.8% in our ILS segment from fiscal 2016 , with the majority of the increase in the ILS segment due to Rofin net sales since the acquisition on November 7, 2016.
21510_17_ITEM7_P2_S2	Net sales for fiscal 2016 increased 10.2% in our OLS segment and decreased 8.0% in our ILS segment from fiscal 2015 .
21510_17_ITEM7_P2_S3	For a description of additional reasons for changes in net sales refer to the "Results of Operations" section below.
21510_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	Gross Profit as a Percentage of Net Sales Gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit percentage") is calculated as gross profit for the period divided by net sales for the period.
21510_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	Gross profit percentage for OLS increased to 53.6% in fiscal 2017 from 48.3% in fiscal 2016 and from 45.5% in fiscal 2015 .
21510_17_ITEM7_P3_S2	Gross profit percentage for ILS decreased to 24.4% in fiscal 2017 from 26.0% in fiscal 2016 and from 27.0% in fiscal 2015 .
21510_17_ITEM7_P3_S3	For a description of the reasons for changes in gross profit refer to the "Results of Operations" section below.
21510_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	Research and development as a percentage of net sales ("R D percentage") is calculated as research and development expense for the period divided by net sales for the period.
21510_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	Management considers R D percentage to be an important indicator in managing our business as investing in new technologies is a key to future growth.
21510_17_ITEM7_P4_S2	R D percentage decreased to 6.9% in fiscal 2017 from 9.5% in fiscal 2016 and 10.2% in fiscal 2015 .
21510_17_ITEM7_P4_S3	For a description of the reasons for changes in R D spending refer to the "Results of Operations" section below.
21510_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows primarily represents the excess of cash collected from billings to our customers and other receipts over cash paid to our vendors for expenses and inventory purchases to run our business.
21510_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	We believe that cash flows from operations are an important performance indicator because cash generation over the long term is essential to maintaining a healthy business and providing funds to help fuel growth.
21510_17_ITEM7_P5_S2	For a description of the reasons for changes in Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities refer to the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section below.
21510_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	Days Sales Outstanding in Receivables We calculate days sales outstanding ("DSO") in receivables as net receivables at the end of the period divided by net sales during the period and then multiplied by the number of days in the period, using 360 days for years.
21510_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	DSO in receivables indicates how well we are managing our collection of receivables, with lower DSO in receivables resulting in higher working capital availability.
21510_17_ITEM7_P6_S2	The more money we have tied up in receivables, the less money we have available for research and development, acquisitions, expansion, marketing and other activities to grow our business.
21510_17_ITEM7_P6_S3	Our DSO in receivables for fiscal 2017 decreased to 63.9 days from 69.6 days in fiscal 2016 .
21510_17_ITEM7_P6_S4	The decrease in DSO in receivables is primarily due to higher sales of ELA tools used in the flat panel display market in Asia and the timing of collection of those receivables, lower sales and receivables in Japan which typically has a higher DSO and a lower concentration of sales in the last two months of the year partially offset by the impact of our acquisition of Rofin, which has higher DSOs than those previously reported by us prior to the acquisition.
21510_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	Annualized Fourth Quarter Inventory Turns We calculate annualized fourth quarter inventory turns as cost of sales during the fourth quarter annualized and divided by net inventories at the end of the fourth quarter.
21510_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	This indicates how well we are managing our inventory levels, with higher inventory turns resulting in more working capital availability and a higher return on our investments in inventory.
21510_17_ITEM7_P7_S2	The more money we have tied up in inventory, the less money we have available for research and development, acquisitions, expansion, marketing and other activities to grow our business.
21510_17_ITEM7_P7_S3	Our annualized fourth quarter inventory turns for fiscal 2017 increased to 2.6 turns from 2.5 turns in fiscal 2016 .
21510_17_ITEM7_P7_S4	Improvements in turns due to higher shipments of large ELA tools used in the flat panel display market were partially offset by the impact of our acquisition of Rofin in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 due to Rofin's lower inventory turns rate.
21510_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	Capital Spending as a Percentage of Net Sales Capital spending as a percentage of net sales ("capital spending percentage") is calculated as capital expenditures for the period divided by net sales for the period.
21510_17_ITEM7_P8_S1	Capital spending percentage indicates the extent to which we are expanding or improving our operations, including investments in technology and equipment.
21510_17_ITEM7_P8_S2	Management monitors capital spending levels as this assists us in measuring our cash flows, net of capital expenditures.
21510_17_ITEM7_P8_S3	Our capital spending percentage decreased to 3.7% in fiscal 2017 from 5.8% in fiscal 2016 .
21510_17_ITEM7_P8_S4	Our capital spending percentage increased to 5.8% in fiscal 2016 from 2.8% in fiscal 2015 .
21510_17_ITEM7_P8_S5	The fiscal 2017 decrease was primarily due to the impact of higher revenues in fiscal 2017 partially offset by investments to expand our manufacturing capacity in G ttingen, Germany, incremental capital spending due to our acquisition of Rofin in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the upgrade of certain of our production facilities in California and higher purchases of production-related assets.
21510_17_ITEM7_P8_S6	The fiscal 2016 increase was primarily due to increased investments to expand our manufacturing capacity in G ttingen, Germany, the upgrade of certain of our production facilities in California and New Jersey and higher purchases of production-related assets, partially offset by the impact of higher revenues in fiscal 2016.
21510_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	We define adjusted EBITDA as operating income adjusted for depreciation, amortization, stock compensation expense, major restructuring costs and certain other non-operating income and expense items, such as costs related to our acquisition of Rofin.
21510_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	Key initiatives for EBITDA improvements include utilization of our Asian manufacturing locations, optimizing our supply chain and continued leveraging of our infrastructure.
21510_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	We consider the use of non-GAAP financial measures helpful in assessing our current financial performance and ongoing operations.
21510_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	While we use non-GAAP financial measures as a tool to enhance our understanding of certain aspects of our financial performance, we do not consider these measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial measures.
21510_17_ITEM7_P11_S2	We provide adjusted EBITDA in order to enhance investors' understanding of our ongoing operations.
21510_17_ITEM7_P11_S3	This measure is used by some investors when assessing our performance.
21510_17_ITEM7_P11_S4	Below is the reconciliation of our net income from continuing operations as a percentage of net sales to our adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales:
21510_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	SIGNIFICANT EVENTS Acquisitions and related financing On November 7, 2016 , we completed our acquisition of Rofin pursuant to the Merger Agreement dated March 16, 2016.
21510_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	Rofin is one of the world's leading developers and manufacturers of high-performance industrial laser sources and laser-based solutions and components.
21510_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	The acquisition was an all-cash transaction at a price of $32.50 per share of Rofin common stock.
21510_17_ITEM7_P13_S2	The aggregate consideration paid by us to the former Rofin stockholders was approximately $904.5 million , excluding related transaction fees and expenses.
21510_17_ITEM7_P13_S3	We also paid $15.3 million due to the cancellation of options held by employees of Rofin.
21510_17_ITEM7_P13_S4	We funded the payment of the aggregate consideration with a combination of our available cash on hand and the proceeds from the Euro Term Loan described below.
21510_17_ITEM7_P13_S5	As a condition of the acquisition, we were required to hold separate and divest Rofin s low power CO 2 laser business based in Hull, United Kingdom (the Hull Business ) and have reported this business separately as a discontinued operation in this Form 10-K for the year ending September 30, 2017.
21510_17_ITEM7_P13_S6	We completed the divestiture of the Hull Business on October 11, 2017, after receiving approval for the terms of the sale from the European Commission.
21510_17_ITEM7_P13_S7	See Note 3, "Business Combinations" in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of this annual report for further discussion of the acquisition.
21510_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	On November 7, 2016, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement ) with Barclays Bank PLC ("Barclays"), Bank of America, N.A. ("BAML") and MUFG Union Bank, N.A. ("MUFG").
21510_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	The Credit Agreement provided for a 670.0 million Euro senior secured term loan facility (the Euro Term Loan ) and a $100.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility.
21510_17_ITEM7_P14_S2	On November 7, 2016, the Euro Term Loan was drawn in full and its proceeds were used to finance our acquisition of Rofin and pay related fees and expenses.
21510_17_ITEM7_P14_S3	Also, on November 7, 2016, we used 10.0 million Euros of the capacity under the revolving credit facility for the issuance of a letter of credit.
21510_17_ITEM7_P14_S4	On May 8, 2017, we entered into Amendment No. 1 and Waiver (the "Repricing Amendment") to the Credit Agreement.
21510_17_ITEM7_P14_S5	See Note 9, Borrowings in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
21510_17_ITEM7_P14_S6	In relation to our acquisition of Rofin, we paid Barclays, our financial advisor, a fee of approximately $9.5 million , $1.0 million of which was paid upon delivery of the fairness opinion in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, and the remaining portion of which was paid upon consummation of the acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal 2017; these fees were recorded in selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations.
21510_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	together approximately $17.0 million and $5.6 million for underwriting and upfront fees, respectively, upon the close of the financing on November 7, 2016; these fees are recorded as debt issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheets.
21510_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	As a result of our acquisition of Rofin in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we reorganized into two new reporting segments for the combined company based upon our organizational structure and how our Chief Operating Decision Maker receives and utilizes information provided to allocate resources and make decisions: OLS and ILS.
21510_17_ITEM7_P16_S1	This segmentation reflects the go-to-market strategies and synergies for our broad portfolio of laser technologies and products.
21510_17_ITEM7_P16_S2	While both segments deliver cost-effective, highly reliable photonics solutions, the OLS business segment, is focused on high performance laser sources and complex optical sub-systems, typically used in microelectronics manufacturing, medical diagnostics and therapeutic medical applications, as well as in scientific research.
21510_17_ITEM7_P16_S3	Our ILS business segment delivers high performance laser sources, sub-systems and tools primarily used for industrial laser materials processing, serving important end markets like automotive, machine tool, consumer goods and medical device manufacturing On July 24, 2015, we acquired certain assets of Raydiance, Inc. ("Raydiance") for approximately $5.0 million, excluding transaction costs.
21510_17_ITEM7_P16_S4	Raydiance manufactured complete tools and lasers for ultrafast processing systems and subsystems in the precision micromachining processing market.

21510_17_ITEM7_P18_S2	The Tinsley assets have been included in our OLS segment.
21510_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	On June 8, 2010, we invested $2.0 million in SiOnyx, Inc., a privately-held company.
21510_17_ITEM7_P19_S1	The investment was included in other assets and was being carried on a cost basis.
21510_17_ITEM7_P19_S2	During the third quarter of fiscal 2015 we determined that our investment became other-than temporarily impaired.
21510_17_ITEM7_P19_S3	As a result, we recorded a non-cash charge of $2.0 million to operating expense in our results of operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.
21510_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FISCAL 2017 , 2016 AND 2015 Fiscal 2017 and 2016 consisted of 52 weeks.
21510_17_ITEM7_P20_S1	Fiscal 2015 consisted of 53 weeks.
21510_17_ITEM7_P20_S2	The following table sets forth, for the years indicated, the percentage of total net sales represented by the line items reflected in our consolidated statement of operations:
21510_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	Refer to Item 6 "Selected Financial Data" for a description of significant events that impacted the results of operations for fiscal years 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
21510_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	Backlog Backlog represents orders which we expect to be shipped within 12 months and the current portion of service contracts.
21510_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	Orders used to compute backlog are generally cancelable and, depending on the notice period, are subject to rescheduling by our customers without substantial penalties.
21510_17_ITEM7_P22_S2	Historically, we have not experienced a significant rate of cancellation or rescheduling, though we cannot guarantee that the rate of cancellations or rescheduling will not increase in the future.
21510_17_ITEM7_P22_S3	We had a backlog of orders shippable within 12 months of $1,040.0 million at September 30, 2017 , including a significant concentration in the flat panel display market ( 59% ) for customers which are primarily located in Asia.
21510_17_ITEM7_P22_S4	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the amount of net sales and their relative percentages of total net sales by market application (dollars in thousands):
21510_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	Net sales in fiscal 2017 included $434.9 million of Rofin net sales since the acquisition on November 7, 2016, primarily in the materials processing market.
21510_17_ITEM7_P23_S1	During fiscal 2017 , net sales increased by $865.9 million , or 101% , compared to fiscal 2016 , with significant increases in the microelectronics and materials processing markets, a smaller increase in the OEM components and instrumentation market and a decrease in the scientific and government programs market.
21510_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	Microelectronics sales increased $439.3 million , or 97% , primarily due to higher shipments related to ELA tools used in the flat panel display market including higher revenues from consumable parts as well as higher shipments related to advanced packaging and semiconductor applications.
21510_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	We expect continued growth in the microelectronics market with flat panel display demand fully utilizing our manufacturing capacity in fiscal 2018, higher flat panel display revenues from consumable parts due to our higher installed base, spending in the semiconductor capital equipment market at a level similar to fiscal 2017 and continued recovery in the advanced packaging market.
21510_17_ITEM7_P24_S2	Materials processing sales increased $387.9 million , or 313% , during fiscal 2017 primarily due to the addition of Rofin net sales and higher shipments for machine tools, automotive and other materials processing applications.
21510_17_ITEM7_P24_S3	We expect continued growth in multiple materials processing applications including automotive (especially battery welding for electric vehicles) and machine tooling, medical device manufacturing, consumer goods manufacturing for packaging, converting, marking and additive manufacturing.
21510_17_ITEM7_P24_S4	We also expect continued steady progress in sales of our high power fiber lasers and are expanding our manufacturing capacity accordingly.
21510_17_ITEM7_P24_S5	The increase in the OEM components and instrumentation market of $41.5 million , or 26% , during fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher shipments for military, medical and bio-instrumentation applications, with much of the increase in military applications due to our acquisition of Rofin.
21510_17_ITEM7_P24_S6	In OEM components and instrumentation applications, we are seeing strong demand in the bio-instrumentation market, higher demand for consumables in the medical market, in dental applications and in eye disease management as well as increased demand in the defense and aerospace market.
21510_17_ITEM7_P24_S7	The decrease in scientific and government programs market sales of $2.8 million , or 2% , during fiscal 2017 was primarily due to lower demand for advanced research applications used by university and government research groups in the U.S.
21510_17_ITEM7_P24_S8	We expect demand in the scientific and government programs market to continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter.
21510_17_ITEM7_P24_S9	During fiscal 2016, net sales increased by $54.9 million, or 7%, compared to fiscal 2015, including decreases due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, with sales increases in the microelectronics, materials processing and scientific and government programs markets partially offset by decreases in the OEM components and instrumentation market.
21510_17_ITEM7_P24_S10	Microelectronics sales increased $48.7 million, or 12%, primarily due to higher shipments for flat panel display annealing systems and higher shipments for semiconductor applications partially offset by lower shipments for advanced packaging applications.
21510_17_ITEM7_P24_S11	Materials processing sales increased $13.0 million, or 12%, during fiscal 2016 primarily due to higher shipments for cutting, marking and other materials processing applications.
21510_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	The decrease in the OEM components and instrumentation market of $7.2 million, or 4%, during fiscal 2016 was primarily due to lower shipments for medical and machine vision applications partially offset by higher shipments for military and bio-instrumentation applications.
21510_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	The timing for shipments of our higher average selling price excimer products in the flat panel display market have historically fluctuated and are in the future expected to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter due to customer scheduling, our ability to manufacture these products and/or availability of critical component parts and supplies.
21510_17_ITEM7_P25_S2	As a result, the timing to convert orders for these products to net sales will likely fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter.
21510_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	We have historically experienced decreased revenue in the first fiscal quarter compared to other quarters in our fiscal year due to the impact of time off and business closures at our facilities and those of many of our customers due to year-end holidays.
21510_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	For example over the past 10 years, excluding certain recovery years, our first fiscal quarter revenues have ranged 2%-12% below the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal years.
21510_17_ITEM7_P26_S2	With the acquisition of Rofin in fiscal 2017, we expect a more pronounced decrease in revenues in the first quarter of the fiscal year as Rofin has historically experienced more pronounced seasonality, particularly in materials processing applications, than Coherent historically has experienced.
21510_17_ITEM7_P26_S3	In fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , one customer accounted for 23% , 13% and 17% of net sales, respectively.
21510_17_ITEM7_P26_S4	In fiscal 2016, another customer accounted for 16% of net sales.
21510_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	Segments We are organized into two reportable operating segments: OLS and ILS.
21510_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	While both segments deliver cost-effective, highly reliable photonics solutions, OLS is focused on high performance laser sources and complex optical sub-systems, typically used in microelectronics manufacturing, medical diagnostics and therapeutic medical applications, as well as in scientific research.
21510_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	ILS delivers high performance laser sources, sub-systems and tools primarily used for industrial laser materials processing, serving important end markets like automotive, machine tool, consumer goods and medical device manufacturing.
21510_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the amount of net sales and their relative percentages of total net sales by segment (dollars in thousands):
21510_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2017 increased $865.9 million , or 101% , compared to fiscal 2016 , with increases of $421.1 million , or 58% , in our OLS segment and increases of $444.8 million , or 330% , in our ILS segment.
21510_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	The impact of foreign exchange rates was not significant to fiscal 2017 sales in either segment.
21510_17_ITEM7_P30_S2	Net sales for fiscal 2016 increased $54.9 million , or 7% , compared to fiscal 2015, with increases of $66.7 million , or 10.2% , in our OLS segment and decreases of $11.7 million , or 8.0% , in our ILS segment.
21510_17_ITEM7_P30_S3	Both the fiscal 2016 increase and decrease in OLS and ILS segment sales, respectively, included decreases due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
21510_17_ITEM7_P30_S4	The increase in our OLS segment sales in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher shipments of ELA tools used in the flat panel display market and higher revenues from consumable parts as well as higher shipments for semiconductor and advanced packaging applications.
21510_17_ITEM7_P30_S5	The increase in our OLS segment sales in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to higher shipments of ELA tools used in the flat panel display market and higher revenues from consumable parts as well as higher shipments for materials processing, semiconductor and military applications partially offset by lower shipments for medical and advanced packaging applications.
21510_17_ITEM7_P30_S6	The fiscal 2016 increase includes an increase of $11.3 million, primarily in military and scientific applications, resulting from our acquisitions of Tinsley and Raydiance assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
21510_17_ITEM7_P30_S7	The increase in our ILS segment sales from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher shipments for materials processing, microelectronics and OEM components and instrumentation applications due to our acquisition of Rofin ($429.2 million) as well as higher shipments to the medical, flat panel display and advanced packaging markets.
21510_17_ITEM7_P30_S8	The decrease in our ILS segment sales from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to lower advanced packaging, materials processing and medical application sales.
21510_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	Our gross profit rate decreased by 1.0% to 43.5% in fiscal 2017 from 44.5% in fiscal 2016 primarily due to the impact of purchase accounting adjustments (4.0%) for amortization of inventory step-up and amortization of intangibles related to our acquisition of Rofin in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
21510_17_ITEM7_P31_S1	Also contributing to the decrease was the impact of our acquisition of Rofin due to Rofin s margins that are lower than Coherent s historical margins (3.6% before considering purchase accounting adjustments).
21510_17_ITEM7_P31_S2	The decreases were partially offset by improvements in margins of Coherent historical products (6.6%) primarily due to the favorable leverage of manufacturing costs on higher volumes and favorable mix in flat panel display applications for both system sales and service, as well as the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, lower inventory provisions for excess and obsolete inventory, reduced freight costs and lower warranty costs as a percentage of sales due to the impact of significantly higher net sales.
21510_17_ITEM7_P31_S3	Our gross profit rate increased by 2.7% to 44.5% in fiscal 2016 from 41.8% in fiscal 2015 primarily due to favorable product margins (2.2%) resulting from the impact of higher volumes in certain business units (primarily flat panel display applications) and the favorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations (primarily the Euro and Yen) as well as favorable mix in the microelectronics market, particularly for flat panel display applications, net of unfavorable mix in the OEM components and instrumentation market.
21510_17_ITEM7_P31_S4	In addition, the margin also benefited from lower other costs (0.3%) due primarily to an accrual in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 for a customs audit in South Korea and lower inventory charges for excess or obsolete inventory as well as lower warranty costs (0.2%) due to fewer warranty events.
21510_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	Our gross profit rate has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors including market and product mix, pricing on volume orders, shipment volumes, our ability to manufacture advanced and more complex products, manufacturing efficiencies, excess and obsolete inventory write-downs, warranty costs, amortization of intangibles, pricing by competitors or suppliers, new product introductions, production volume, customization and reconfiguration of systems, commodity prices and foreign currency fluctuations, particularly the recent volatility of the Euro and a lesser extent, the Japanese Yen and South Korean Won.
21510_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	OEM Laser Sources Our OLS gross profit rate increased by 5.3% to 53.6% in fiscal 2017 from 48.3% in fiscal 2016 primarily due to favorable product margins (4.1%) as a result of favorable mix within flat panel display applications for both systems and service, favorable mix in other microelectronics and materials processing applications and higher leverage of manufacturing costs on higher volumes, as well as the favorable impact of the weaker Euro and stronger Yen and Won compared to fiscal 2016.
21510_17_ITEM7_P32_S2	Also contributing to the increase in gross profit rate as a percentage of sales due to the impact of significantly higher sales volumes were lower other costs (0.7%) due to lower inventory provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and reduced freight and duty costs in certain business units, lower intangibles amortization (0.3%) and lower installation and warranty costs (0.2%).
21510_17_ITEM7_P32_S3	Our OLS gross profit rate increased by 2.8% to 48.3% in fiscal 2016 from 45.5% in fiscal 2015 primarily due to favorable product margins (2.4%), lower warranty costs (0.2%) due to fewer warranty events, lower other costs (0.1%) and lower intangibles amortization expense (0.1%).
21510_17_ITEM7_P32_S4	The 2.7% product margin improvement resulted from the impact of higher volumes in most business units and the favorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations (primarily the Euro and Yen) as well as favorable mix in the microelectronics market, particularly for flat panel display applications, including favorable service mix net of unfavorable mix in the OEM components and instrumentation market.
21510_17_ITEM7_P32_S5	Our ILS gross profit rate decreased by 1.6% to 24.4% in fiscal 2017 from 26.0% in fiscal 2016 primarily due to the impact of purchase accounting adjustments (11.1%) for amortization of intangibles and inventory step-up related to our acquisition of Rofin in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and restructuring costs (1.1%) related to the implementation of planned restructuring activities in connection with our acquisition of Rofin, which is primarily related to the exit from our preexisting high power fiber laser product line and other Rofin product lines.
21510_17_ITEM7_P32_S6	The decreases in gross profit rate were partially offset by the favorable impact of Rofin's margins before considering purchase accounting adjustments.
21510_17_ITEM7_P32_S7	Rofin s high-power fiber laser and global tools businesses have higher margins than Coherent s legacy ILS businesses.
21510_17_ITEM7_P32_S8	Our ILS gross profit rate decreased by 1.0% to 26.0% in fiscal 2016 from 27.0% in fiscal 2015 primarily due to unfavorable product margin (1.1%) and higher warranty costs (0.3%) due to more warranty events partially offset by lower other costs (0.5%) due to lower freight and packaging costs as well as lower inventory charges for excess or obsolete inventory.
21510_17_ITEM7_P32_S9	The 1.1% product margin deterioration resulted from unfavorable yields and lower volumes in certain business units partially offset by favorable mix in the OEM components and instrumentation and materials processing markets.
21510_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the amount of operating expenses and their relative percentages of total net sales by the line items reflected in our consolidated statement of operations (dollars in thousands):
21510_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	Research and development Fiscal 2017 research and development ("R D") expenses increased $37.4 million , or 46% , from fiscal 2016 , but decreased to 6.9% of sales, compared to 9.5% in fiscal 2016.
21510_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	The increase was primarily due to the addition of Rofin R D expenses ($32.0 million, excluding $0.7 million of restructuring costs for severance) since the acquisition on November 7, 2016, $2.2 million higher project spending, including higher variable compensation and lower reimbursements from customers, and $2.1 million of restructuring costs related to the exit from our historical Coherent high power fiber laser product line in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
21510_17_ITEM7_P34_S2	There were also increases of $0.8 million for higher stock-based compensation expense including $0.4 million related to a charge recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 due to the acceleration of Rofin options and $0.3 million higher charges for increases in deferred compensation plan liabilities.
21510_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	On a segment basis as compared to the prior year period, OLS research and development spending increased $7.4 million primarily due to higher net spending on projects.

21510_17_ITEM7_P35_S3	Fiscal 2016 R D expenses increased $0.3 million, or less than 1%, from fiscal 2015, but decreased to 9.5% from 10.2% of net sales.
21510_17_ITEM7_P35_S4	The $0.3 million increase was primarily due to $2.0 million incremental spending from the asset acquisitions from Tinsley and Raydiance, both of which were acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, $0.3 million higher stock-based compensation expense and $0.3 million higher charges for increases in deferred compensation plan liabilities.
21510_17_ITEM7_P35_S5	The increases were partially offset by $2.3 million lower project spending including the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, lower spending on labor and materials and higher customer reimbursements.
21510_17_ITEM7_P35_S6	On a segment basis, OLS spending increased $0.7 million primarily due to the asset acquisitions from Tinsley and Raydiance partially offset by lower project spending including the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
21510_17_ITEM7_P35_S7	ILS spending decreased $1.4 million primarily due to lower spending on projects and higher customer reimbursements.
21510_17_ITEM7_P35_S8	Corporate and other spending increased $1.0 million primarily due to higher charges for increases in deferred compensation plan liabilities and higher stock-based compensation expense.
21510_17_ITEM7_P35_S9	Selling, general and administrative Fiscal 2017 selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses increased $122.9 million , or 73% , from fiscal 2016 .
21510_17_ITEM7_P35_S10	The increase was primarily due to the addition of Rofin SG A expenses ($75.2 million excluding $2.6 million restructuring costs for severance) following the acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, $15.5 million higher other spending on legal, consulting and infrastructure related to integration activities and the debt repricing as well as other variable spending in support of higher sales, $11.1 million higher payroll spending for variable compensation, commissions and salaries and benefits and $7.7 million higher financial advisory, consulting and legal costs related to our acquisition of Rofin.
21510_17_ITEM7_P35_S11	SG A expense also increased due to $8.6 million higher stock-based compensation expense, including $3.4 million related to a charge recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 due to the acceleration of Rofin options, as well as higher expense for new grants, $3.4 million of restructuring costs (primarily severance) and $1.4 million higher charges for increases in deferred compensation plan liabilities.
21510_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	ILS spending increased $74.3 million primarily due to our acquisition of Rofin ($78.7 million) and higher payroll and other variable spending.

21510_17_ITEM7_P36_S2	Fiscal 2016 SG A expenses increased $19.3 million, or 13%, from fiscal 2015.
21510_17_ITEM7_P36_S3	The increase was primarily due to a net $8.5 million higher consulting and legal costs related to acquisitions in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 (of which $9.8 million was related to the acquisition of Rofin in fiscal 2016) and $6.2 million higher payroll spending primarily due to higher variable compensation and higher sales commissions net of the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
21510_17_ITEM7_P36_S4	In addition, the increase includes $1.8 million higher charges for increases in deferred compensation plan liabilities, $1.6 million higher stock-based compensation expense due to (1) a higher average stock price during fiscal 2016, (2) a higher number of restricted stock shares outstanding and (3) the expense related to accounting for the transition agreement of our former CFO, and $1.2 million higher other net variable spending including incremental spending from the asset acquisitions of Tinsley and Raydiance.
21510_17_ITEM7_P36_S5	On a segment basis as compared to the prior year period, OLS segment expenses increased $4.9 million primarily due to higher payroll spending and the impact due to the asset acquisitions from Tinsley and Raydiance net of the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
21510_17_ITEM7_P36_S6	ILS spending increased $1.0 million primarily due to higher payroll spending net of the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
21510_17_ITEM7_P36_S7	Spending for Corporate and other increased $13.4 million primarily due to higher consulting and legal costs related to acquisitions, higher charges for increases in deferred compensation plan liabilities, higher stock-based compensation expense and higher payroll spending.
21510_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	Gain on business combination On November 7, 2016, we acquired Rofin at a price of $32.50 per share of Rofin common stock (See Note 3, "Business Combinations" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).
21510_17_ITEM7_P37_S1	We recognized a gain of $5.4 million in our consolidated statements of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 on the increase in fair value from the date of purchase for the shares of Rofin we owned prior to the acquisition.
21510_17_ITEM7_P37_S2	On July 27, 2015, we acquired the assets and certain liabilities of the Tinsley business from L-3 Communications Corporation for approximately $4.3 million , excluding transaction costs (See Note 3).
21510_17_ITEM7_P37_S3	The purchase price was lower than the fair value of net assets purchased, resulting in a gain of $1.3 million recorded in our consolidated statements of operations for our fiscal year 2015.
21510_17_ITEM7_P37_S4	Impairment of assets held for sale In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, management decided to sell several entities that we acquired in the Rofin acquisition.
21510_17_ITEM7_P37_S5	Although the sale was not completed as of the end of fiscal 2017, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $2.9 million to operating expense in our results of operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 to reduce our carrying value in these entities to fair value.
21510_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	Impairment of investment On June 8, 2010, we invested $2.0 million in SiOnyx, Inc., a privately-held company.
21510_17_ITEM7_P38_S1	The investment was included in other assets and was being carried on a cost basis.
21510_17_ITEM7_P38_S2	During the third quarter of fiscal 2015 we determined that our investment became other-than temporarily impaired.
21510_17_ITEM7_P38_S3	As a result, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $2.0 million to operating expense in our results of operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.
21510_17_ITEM7_P38_S4	Amortization of intangible assets Amortization of intangible assets increased $13.2 million , or 464% , from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017 primarily due to our acquisition of Rofin in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
21510_17_ITEM7_P38_S5	Amortization of intangible assets increased $0.2 million, or 6%, from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 primarily due to increases due to the write-off of IPR D of $0.4 million related to our acquisition of Innolight and due to the asset acquisition from Raydiance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 partially offset by the completion of amortization of certain intangibles from prior acquisitions.
21510_17_ITEM7_P38_S6	Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net, changed by $18.7 million to other expense of $23.4 million in fiscal 2017 from other expense of $4.7 million in fiscal 2016 .
21510_17_ITEM7_P38_S7	The higher expenses were primarily due to higher interest expense of $33.0 million partially offset by $11.0 million higher foreign exchange gains and $3.2 million higher gains, net of expenses, on our deferred compensation plan assets, including a death benefit of $1.3 million.
21510_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	issuance costs related to the Euro Term Loan.
21510_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	The higher foreign exchange gains were primarily due to a gain of $11.3 million on forward contracts associated with our foreign exchange risk related to the commitment of our Euro Term Loan and the issuance of the Euro Term Loan to finance our acquisition of Rofin partially offset by the impact of changing rates on cash conversions.
21510_17_ITEM7_P39_S2	Other income (expense), net, changed by $3.5 million to other expense of $4.7 million in fiscal 2016 from other expense of $1.2 million in fiscal 2015.
21510_17_ITEM7_P39_S3	The higher expenses were primarily due to higher net foreign exchange losses ($4.9 million) and $1.3 million higher interest expense primarily for the commitment of our term loan to finance the acquisition of Rofin partially offset by $2.1 million higher gains, net of expenses, on our deferred compensation plan assets and $0.5 million higher interest income due to higher balances of cash and short-term investments.
21510_17_ITEM7_P39_S4	The higher foreign exchange losses were primarily due to (1) higher unhedged exposure in fiscal 2016, (2) a loss of $2.2 million on our hedge of our foreign exchange risk related to the commitment of our term loan to finance the acquisition of Rofin, (3) the significant movement of rates in June 2016 due to the Brexit vote and (4) higher forward points on our hedging contracts.
21510_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	Income taxes The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations before income taxes for fiscal 2017 of 30.9% was lower than the statutory rate of 35.0%.
21510_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	This was primarily due to differences related to the benefit of income subject to foreign tax rates that are lower than U.S. tax rates including the Singapore tax exemption, the benefit of foreign tax credits and federal research and development tax credits, the benefit of a domestic manufacturing deduction under IRC Section 199 and the release of certain tax reserves due to audit settlement.
21510_17_ITEM7_P40_S2	These amounts are partially offset by Rofin transaction costs not deductible for tax purposes, tax costs of Rofin restructuring, ASC 740-10 (formerly FIN48) tax liabilities for transfer pricing, stock-based compensation not deductible for tax purposes and limitations on the deductibility of compensation under IRC Section 162(m).
21510_17_ITEM7_P40_S3	The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations before income taxes for fiscal 2016 of 28.8% was lower than the statutory rate of 35.0%.
21510_17_ITEM7_P40_S4	This was primarily due to differences related to the benefit of income subject to foreign tax rates that are lower than U.S. tax rates including the Singapore tax exemption, the benefit of foreign tax credits and the benefit of federal research and development tax credits including renewal of the federal research and development tax credits for fiscal 2015.
21510_17_ITEM7_P40_S5	These amounts are partially offset by deemed dividend inclusions under the Subpart F tax rules, stock-based compensation not deductible for tax purposes and limitations on the deductibility of compensation under IRC Section 162(m).
21510_17_ITEM7_P40_S6	The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations before income taxes for fiscal 2015 of 23.3% was lower than the statutory rate of 35.0%.
21510_17_ITEM7_P40_S7	This was primarily due to differences related to the benefit of income subject to foreign tax rates that are lower than U.S. tax rates including South Korea and Singapore tax exemptions, the benefit of foreign tax credits and the benefit of federal research and development tax credits including renewal of the federal research and development tax credits for fiscal 2014.
21510_17_ITEM7_P40_S8	These amounts are partially offset by deemed dividend inclusions under the Subpart F tax rules, stock-based compensation not deductible for tax purposes and limitations on the deductibility of compensation under IRC Section 162(m).
21510_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	During fiscal 2017, we increased our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by $11.1 million to $28.7 million primarily due to the increase in California and other states research and development tax credits and the release of R D tax reserves for California and other states, which are not expected to be recognized.
21510_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	During fiscal 2016, we increased our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by $2.1 million to $17.6 million primarily due to the increase in California and other states research and development tax credits which are not expected to be recognized.
21510_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	In making the determination to record the valuation allowance, management considered the likelihood of future taxable income and feasible and prudent tax planning strategies to realize deferred tax assets.
21510_17_ITEM7_P42_S1	In the future, if we determine that we expect to realize deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the valuation allowance will affect income in the period such determination is made.
21510_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	In October 2016, Coherent Singapore received an amended Pioneer Status tax exemption from the Singapore authorities effective from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2021.
21510_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	The tax holiday continues to be conditional upon our meeting certain revenue, business spending and employment thresholds.
21510_17_ITEM7_P43_S2	The impact of this tax exemption decreased Singapore income taxes by approximately $1.1 million and $0.7 million in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively.
21510_17_ITEM7_P43_S3	There are no tax benefits for fiscal 2015 due to the utilization of net operating loss.
21510_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity and capital resources At September 30, 2017 , we had assets classified as cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, in an aggregate amount of $475.6 million , compared to $400.0 million at October 1, 2016 .
21510_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	Our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments included $151.6 million of cash at Rofin entities.
21510_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	At September 30, 2017 , approximately $300.0 million of our cash and securities was held in certain of our foreign subsidiaries, $263.2 million of which was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
21510_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	At September 30, 2017 , we had approximately $299.4 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries where we intend to permanently reinvest our accumulated earnings in these entities and our current plans do not demonstrate a need for these funds to support our domestic operations.
21510_17_ITEM7_P45_S2	If, however, a portion of these funds are needed for and distributed to our operations in the United States, we may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes.
21510_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	An exception to U.S. taxation may be the repatriation of foreign funds that had been previously taxed in the U.S. as Subpart F income.
21510_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	The amount of the U.S. and foreign taxes due would depend on the amount and manner of repatriation, as well as the location from where the funds are repatriated.
21510_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	We actively monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold these assets, primarily focusing on the safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield on these assets.
21510_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	We diversify our cash and cash equivalents and investments among various financial institutions, money market funds, sovereign debt and other securities in order to reduce our exposure should any one of these financial institutions or financial instruments fail or encounter difficulties.
21510_17_ITEM7_P47_S2	To date, we have not experienced any material loss or lack of access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments.
21510_17_ITEM7_P47_S3	However, we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets.
21510_17_ITEM7_P47_S4	In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we spent a significant portion of our foreign funds on the Rofin acquisition.
21510_17_ITEM7_P47_S5	We did not repatriate foreign funds to our domestic operations to fund this acquisition.
21510_17_ITEM7_P47_S6	We expect to have adequate foreign funds in the future to service the acquisition debt and do not anticipate any repatriation of foreign funds to operate our domestic business.
21510_17_ITEM7_P47_S7	In fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, we converted a total of $160.6 million of cash and securities held in certain of our foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars and invested those funds within a European subsidiary whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar.
21510_17_ITEM7_P47_S8	In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we used these funds to purchase Rofin and pay related acquisition expenses.
21510_17_ITEM7_P47_S9	The converted funds were not repatriated to the U.S. and no U.S. tax was triggered on the transfer of these funds to the European subsidiary.
21510_17_ITEM7_P47_S10	See ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK below for more information about risks and trends related to foreign currencies.
21510_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	Sources and Uses of Cash Historically, our primary source of cash has been provided by operations.
21510_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	Other sources of cash in the past three fiscal years include proceeds from our Euro Term Loan used to finance our acquisition of Rofin, proceeds received from the sale of our stock through our employee stock purchase plan as well as borrowings under our domestic line of credit.
21510_17_ITEM7_P48_S2	Our historical uses of cash have primarily been for acquisitions of businesses and technologies, the repurchase of our common stock, capital expenditures and debt issuance costs.
21510_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $278.8 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 and decreased by $19.2 million in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 .
21510_17_ITEM7_P49_S1	The increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher net income, higher cash flows due to higher non-cash expenses for amortization, stock-based compensation and depreciation, higher income taxes payable, higher deferred revenue and higher cash flows from the timing of shipments of large systems from inventory partially offset by lower cash flows from accounts receivable.
21510_17_ITEM7_P49_S2	The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to lower cash flows from the timing of shipments of large systems from inventory and lower cash flows from accounts receivable partially offset by higher net income and higher accrued payroll and accounts payable balances.
21510_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	extent such items are known or are reasonably determinable based on current business and market conditions.
21510_17_ITEM7_P50_S1	However, we may elect to finance certain of our capital expenditure requirements through other sources of capital.
21510_17_ITEM7_P50_S2	We continue to follow our strategy to further strengthen our financial position by using available cash flow to fund operations.
21510_17_ITEM7_P50_S3	We intend to continue to consider acquisition opportunities at valuations we believe are reasonable based upon market conditions.
21510_17_ITEM7_P50_S4	However, we cannot accurately predict the timing, size and success of our acquisition efforts or our associated potential capital commitments.
21510_17_ITEM7_P50_S5	Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire businesses on terms acceptable to us.
21510_17_ITEM7_P50_S6	We expect to fund future acquisitions through additional borrowings (as in our acquisition of Rofin), existing cash balances and cash flows from operations.
21510_17_ITEM7_P50_S7	If required, we will consider the issuance of securities.
21510_17_ITEM7_P50_S8	The extent to which we will be willing or able to use our common stock to make acquisitions will depend on its market value at the time and the willingness of potential sellers to accept it as full or partial payment.
21510_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	On November 7, 2016 (the "Closing Date"), we entered into a Credit Agreement by and among Coherent, Inc., Coherent Holding BV Co. K.G. (formerly Coherent GmbH), as borrower (the Borrower ), and certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries from time to time party thereto, as guarantors, the lenders from time to time party thereto, Barclays, as administrative agent and an L/C Issuer, BAML as an L/C Issuer, and MUFG as an L/C Issuer (the "Credit Agreement").
21510_17_ITEM7_P51_S1	The Credit Agreement provided for a 670.0 million Euro senior secured term loan facility (the "Euro Term Loan") and a $100.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility ("Revolving Credit Facility") with a $30.0 million letter of credit sublimit and a $10.0 million swing line sublimit.
21510_17_ITEM7_P51_S2	The Borrower may increase the aggregate revolving commitments or borrow incremental term loans in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the sum of $150.0 million and an amount that would not cause the senior secured net leverage ratio to be greater than 2.75 to 1.00, subject to certain conditions, including obtaining additional commitments from the lenders then party to the Credit Agreement or new lenders.
21510_17_ITEM7_P51_S3	On November 7, 2016, the Borrower borrowed the full 670.0 million Euros under the Euro Term Loan and its proceeds were used to finance our acquisition of Rofin and pay related fees and expenses.
21510_17_ITEM7_P51_S4	On November 7, 2016, we also used 10.0 million Euros of the capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility for the issuance of a letter of credit.
21510_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Borrower s option, at a rate equal to either (i)(x) in the case of calculations with respect to U.S. Dollars or certain other alternative currencies, the London interbank offered rate (the LIBOR ) or (y) in the case of calculations with respect to the Euro, the euro interbank offered rate ("EURIBOR" and, together with LIBOR, the "Eurocurrency Rate") or (ii) a base rate (the Base Rate ) equal to the highest of (x) the federal funds rate, plus 0.50%, (y) the prime rate then in effect and (z) the Eurocurrency Rate for loans denominated in U.S. dollars applicable to a one-month interest period, plus 1.0%, in each case, plus an applicable margin.
21510_17_ITEM7_P52_S1	The applicable margin for Euro Term Loan borrowed as Eurocurrency Rate loans, is 3.50% initially, and following the first anniversary of the Closing Date ranges from 3.50% to 3.00% depending on the consolidated total gross leverage ratio at the time of determination.
21510_17_ITEM7_P52_S2	For Euro Term Loan borrowed as Base Rate loans, the applicable margin initially is 2.50%, and following the first anniversary of the Closing Date ranges from 2.50% to 2.00% depending upon the consolidated total gross leverage ratio at the time of determination.
21510_17_ITEM7_P52_S3	The applicable margin for revolving loans borrowed as Eurocurrency Rate loans, ranges from 4.25% to 3.75%, and for revolving loans borrowed as Base Rate loans, ranges from 3.25% to 2.75%, in each case, based on the consolidated total gross leverage ratio at the time of determination.
21510_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	Interest on Base Rate loans is payable quarterly in arrears.
21510_17_ITEM7_P53_S1	Interest on Eurocurrency Rate loans is payable at the end of the applicable interest period (or at three month intervals if the interest period exceeds three months).
21510_17_ITEM7_P53_S2	Interest periods for Eurocurrency Rate loans may be, at the Borrower s option, one, two, three or six months.
21510_17_ITEM7_P53_S3	On May 8, 2017, we entered into Amendment No. 1 and Waiver (the Repricing Amendment ) to the Credit Agreement to, among other things, (i) reduce the applicable interest rate margins with respect to the Euro Term Loans to 1.25% for Euro Term Loans maintained as Base Rate loans and 2.25% for Euro Term Loans maintained as Eurocurrency Rate loans, with stepdowns to 1.00% and 2.00%, respectively, available after May 8, 2018 if the consolidated total gross leverage ratio for Coherent and its restricted subsidiaries is less than 1.50:1.00 and (ii) extend the period during which a prepayment premium may be required for a repricing transaction until six months after the effective date of the Repricing Amendment.
21510_17_ITEM7_P53_S4	In connection with the execution of the Repricing Amendment, we paid arrangement fees of approximately $0.5 million, as well as certain fees and expenses of the administrative agent and the Lenders, in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
21510_17_ITEM7_P53_S5	On September 29, 2017, June 30, 2017 and March 31, 2017, we made voluntary principal payments of 75.0 million Euros, 45.0 million Euros and 30.0 million Euros, respectively, on the Euro Term Loan.
21510_17_ITEM7_P53_S6	As of September 30, 2017 , the outstanding principal amount of the Euro Term Loan was 513.3 million Euros.
21510_17_ITEM7_P53_S7	As of September 30, 2017 , the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Credit Facility was 10.0 million Euros.
21510_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	The Credit Agreement requires the Borrower to make scheduled quarterly payments on the Euro Term Loan of 0.25% of the original principal amount of the Euro Term Loan, with any remaining principal payable at maturity.
21510_17_ITEM7_P54_S1	A commitment fee accrues on any unused portion of the revolving loan commitments under the Credit Agreement at a rate of 0.375% or 0.5% depending on the consolidated total gross leverage ratio at any time of determination.
21510_17_ITEM7_P54_S2	The Borrower is also obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type.
21510_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, including covenants regarding the payment of taxes and other obligations, maintenance of insurance, reporting requirements and compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and negative covenants, including covenants limiting the ability of us and our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur debt, grant liens, make investments, make certain restricted payments, transact with affiliates, and sell assets.
21510_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	The Credit Agreement also requires us and our subsidiaries to maintain a senior secured net leverage ratio as of the last day of each fiscal quarter of less of than or equal to 3.50 to 1.00.
21510_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default that include, among other things, payment defaults, cross defaults with certain other indebtedness, violation of covenants, inaccuracy of representations and warranties in any material respect, change in control of us and the Borrower, judgment defaults, and bankruptcy and insolvency events.
21510_17_ITEM7_P56_S1	If an event of default exists, the lenders may require the immediate payment of all Obligations, as defined in the Credit Agreement, and may exercise certain other rights and remedies provided for under the Credit Agreement, the other loan documents and applicable law.
21510_17_ITEM7_P56_S2	The acceleration of such obligations is automatic upon the occurrence of a bankruptcy and insolvency event of default.
21510_17_ITEM7_P56_S3	We were in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2017 .
21510_17_ITEM7_P56_S4	The aggregate consideration paid by us to the former Rofin stockholders in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was approximately $904.5 million, excluding related transaction fees and expenses.
21510_17_ITEM7_P56_S5	We also paid $15.3 million due to the cancellation of options held by employees of Rofin.
21510_17_ITEM7_P56_S6	We paid $5.2 million of debt issuance costs in fiscal 2016 and incurred approximately $26.4 million of debt issuance costs in fiscal 2017.
21510_17_ITEM7_P56_S7	In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, and the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we recorded an interest charge of $1.1 million and $2.7 million , respectively, in other income (expense) in our consolidated statement of operations related to the debt financing commitment.
21510_17_ITEM7_P56_S8	In fiscal 2017, we made debt principal payments of $178.1 million, including voluntary prepayments of $170.7 million, recorded interest expense on the Euro Term Loan of $23.5 million , recorded $7.2 million amortization of debt issuance costs and recorded interest expense of $2.7 million for the commitment of the Euro Term loan.
21510_17_ITEM7_P56_S9	In relation to our acquisition of Rofin, we paid Barclays, our financial advisor, a fee of approximately $9.5 million , $1.0 million of which was paid upon delivery of the fairness opinion in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, and the remaining portion of which was paid upon consummation of the acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal 2017; these fees were recorded as SG A expense.
21510_17_ITEM7_P56_S10	Additional sources of cash available to us were domestic and international currency lines of credit and bank credit facilities totaling $29.2 million as of September 30, 2017 , of which $23.3 million was unused and available.
21510_17_ITEM7_P56_S11	As of September 30, 2017 , we had utilized $5.9 million of the international credit facilities as guarantees in Europe.
21510_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	In fiscal 2015, under plans authorized by the Board of Directors, we repurchased and retired 1,302,323 shares of outstanding common stock at an average price of $57.59 per share for a total of $75.0 million .
21510_17_ITEM7_P57_S1	Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 3.1 :1 at September 30, 2017 , compared to 4.0 :1 at October 1, 2016 .
21510_17_ITEM7_P57_S2	The decrease in our ratio is primarily due to the use of cash in our acquisition of Rofin and higher income taxes payable and deferred income partially offset by the impact of Rofin's current assets and current liabilities.
21510_17_ITEM7_P57_S3	Our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and working capital are as follows (in thousands):
21510_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933.
21510_17_ITEM7_P58_S1	The following summarizes our contractual obligations at September 30, 2017 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):
21510_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	Because of the uncertainty as to the timing of such payments, we have excluded cash payments related to our contractual obligations for our deferred compensation plans aggregating $35.0 million at September 30, 2017 .
21510_17_ITEM7_P59_S1	As of September 30, 2017, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $50.4 million which includes penalties and interest of $2.8 million .
21510_17_ITEM7_P59_S2	Approximately $35.9 million has been recorded as a noncurrent liability.
21510_17_ITEM7_P59_S3	At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table.
21510_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	Changes in financial condition Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017 was $384.1 million , which included net income of $207.1 million , depreciation and amortization of $111.4 million , cash provided by operating assets and liabilities of $54.8 million (primarily increases in taxes payable, deferred income and accounts payable net of increases in accounts receivable and inventories), stock-based compensation expense of $26.3 million , non-cash restructuring charges of $6.4 million , non-cash pension benefit of $5.4 million , impairment charges of $2.9 million and $1.5 million other, partially offset by increases in net deferred tax assets of $19.8 million , the $5.4 million gain on business combination, $4.9 million net cash flows used by discontinued operations and $1.6 million excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation arrangements.

21510_17_ITEM7_P60_S2	Cash used investing activities in fiscal 2017 of $810.3 million included $740.5 million net of cash acquired to purchase Rofin, $61.8 million , net, used to acquire property and equipment, purchase and upgrade buildings, net of proceeds from dispositions, $7.2 million net purchases of available-for-sale securities and $0.8 million net cash flows used by discontinued operations.
21510_17_ITEM7_P60_S3	Cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2016 of $103.4 million included $152.2 million net sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities partially offset by $48.8 million, net, used to acquire property and equipment, purchase and upgrade buildings, net of proceeds from dispositions.
21510_17_ITEM7_P60_S4	Cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2017 was $506.0 million , which included $539.1 million net borrowings $8.1 million generated from our employee purchase plans and $1.6 million excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation arrangements partially offset by $26.4 million of debt issuance costs, $15.7 million outflows due to net settlement of restricted stock and $0.8 million payments to minority shareholders.
21510_17_ITEM7_P60_S5	Cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2016 was $17.2 million, which included $20.0 million net borrowings, and $7.8 million generated from our employee stock option and purchase plans partially offset by $5.4 million outflows due to net settlement of restricted stock and $5.2 million of debt issuance costs.
21510_17_ITEM7_P60_S6	Changes in exchange rates in fiscal 2017 resulted in an increase in cash balances of $22.9 million .
21510_17_ITEM7_P60_S7	Changes in exchange rates in fiscal 2016 resulted in a decrease in cash balances of $2.2 million.
21510_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the respective dates of adoption or expected adoption and effects on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
21510_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.
21510_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
21510_17_ITEM7_P63_S1	We have identified the following as the items that require the most significant judgment and often involve complex estimation: revenue recognition, business combinations, accounting for long-lived assets (including goodwill and intangible assets), inventory valuation, warranty reserves, stock-based compensation and accounting for income taxes.
21510_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered or the service has been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable.
21510_17_ITEM7_P64_S1	Revenue from product sales is recorded when all of the foregoing conditions are met and risk of loss and title passes to the customer.
21510_17_ITEM7_P64_S2	Our products typically include a warranty and the estimated cost of product warranty claims (based on historical experience) is recorded at the time the sale is recognized.
21510_17_ITEM7_P64_S3	Sales to customers are generally not subject to any price protection or return rights.
21510_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	The majority of our sales are made to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), distributors, representatives and end-users in the non-scientific market.
21510_17_ITEM7_P65_S1	Sales made to these customers do not require installation of the products by us and are not subject to other post-delivery obligations, except in occasional instances where we have agreed to perform installation or provide training.
21510_17_ITEM7_P65_S2	In those instances, we defer revenue related to installation services or training until these services have been rendered.
21510_17_ITEM7_P65_S3	We allocate revenue from multiple element arrangements to the various elements based upon fair values or a selling price hierarchy, as more fully described in Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition," in our consolidated financial statements.
21510_17_ITEM7_P65_S4	Should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions, revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected.
21510_17_ITEM7_P65_S5	Failure to obtain anticipated orders due to delays or cancellations of orders could have a material adverse effect on our revenue.
21510_17_ITEM7_P65_S6	In addition, pressures from customers to reduce our prices or to modify our existing sales terms may have a material adverse effect on our revenue in future periods.
21510_17_ITEM7_P65_S7	Our sales to distributors, representatives and end-user customers typically do not have customer acceptance provisions and only certain of our sales to OEM customers and integrators have customer acceptance provisions.
21510_17_ITEM7_P65_S8	Customer acceptance is generally limited to performance under our published product specifications.
21510_17_ITEM7_P65_S9	For the few product sales that have customer acceptance provisions because of higher than published specifications, (1) the products are tested and accepted by the customer at our site or the customer accepts the results of our testing program prior to shipment to the customer, or (2) the revenue is deferred until customer acceptance occurs.
21510_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	Sales to end-users in the scientific market typically require installation and, thus, involve post-delivery obligations; however our post-delivery installation obligations are not essential to the functionality of our products.
21510_17_ITEM7_P66_S1	We defer revenue related to installation services until completion of these services.
21510_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	For most products, training is not provided; therefore, no post-delivery training obligation exists.
21510_17_ITEM7_P67_S1	However, when training is provided to our customers, it is typically priced separately and recognized as revenue as these services are provided.
21510_17_ITEM7_P67_S2	For multiple element arrangements which include extended maintenance contracts, we allocate and defer the amount of consideration equal to the separately stated price and recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
21510_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	We include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the respective dates of acquisition.
21510_17_ITEM7_P68_S1	We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our business acquisitions to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, based on their estimated fair values.
21510_17_ITEM7_P68_S2	The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.
21510_17_ITEM7_P68_S3	Additional information existing as of the acquisition date, but unknown to us at that time, may become known during the remainder of the measurement period, not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date, which may result in changes to the amounts and allocations recorded.
21510_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill We evaluate long-lived assets and amortizable intangible assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances or our planned use of assets indicate that their carrying amounts may not be fully recoverable or that their useful lives are no longer appropriate.
21510_17_ITEM7_P69_S1	Reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying values of the assets are impaired based on comparison to the undiscounted expected future cash flows identifiable to such long-lived and amortizable intangible assets.
21510_17_ITEM7_P69_S2	If the comparison indicates that impairment exists, the impaired asset is written down to its fair value.
21510_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	We have determined that our reporting units are the same as our operating segments as each constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results.
21510_17_ITEM7_P70_S1	We make this determination in a manner consistent with how the operating segments are managed.
21510_17_ITEM7_P70_S2	Based on this analysis, we have identified two reporting units which are our reportable segments: OLS and ILS.
21510_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and written down when impaired (See Note 7, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).
21510_17_ITEM7_P71_S1	We generally perform our annual impairment tests during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter, with any resulting impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.
21510_17_ITEM7_P71_S2	In January 2017, the FASB issued amended guidance that simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.
21510_17_ITEM7_P71_S3	Under the amendments in this update, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value.
21510_17_ITEM7_P71_S4	The new standard will become effective for our fiscal year beginning October 2, 2021.
21510_17_ITEM7_P71_S5	We elected to early adopt the standard in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 for our fiscal 2017 impairment tests.
21510_17_ITEM7_P71_S6	In fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, we conducted a qualitative assessment of the goodwill in the OLS (formerly SLS) reporting unit during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount.
21510_17_ITEM7_P71_S7	In assessing the qualitative factors, we considered the impact of these key factors: macroeconomic conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency, market and industry conditions, our operating and competitive environment, regulatory and political developments, the overall financial performance of our reporting units including cost factors and budgeted-to-actual revenue results.
21510_17_ITEM7_P71_S8	We also considered our market capitalization, stock price performance and the significant excess calculated in the prior year between estimated fair value and the carrying value of OLS.
21510_17_ITEM7_P71_S9	Based on our assessment, goodwill in the OLS reporting unit was not impaired as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015.
21510_17_ITEM7_P71_S10	As such, it was not necessary to perform the goodwill impairment test at that time in any of those fiscal years.
21510_17_ITEM7_P71_S11	For our ILS (former CLC) reporting unit we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 and proceeded directly to performing the first step of goodwill impairment.
21510_17_ITEM7_P71_S12	Accordingly, we performed the Step 1 test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015.
21510_17_ITEM7_P71_S13	We determined the fair value of the reporting unit for the Step 1 test using a 50-50% weighting of the Income (discounted cash flow) approach and Market (market comparable) approach.
21510_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	The Income approach utilizes the discounted cash flow model to provide an estimation of fair value based on the cash flows that a business expects to generate.
21510_17_ITEM7_P72_S1	These cash flows are based on forecasts developed internally by management which are then discounted at an after tax rate of return required by equity and debt market participants of a business enterprise.
21510_17_ITEM7_P72_S2	This rate of return or cost of capital is weighted based on the capitalization of comparable companies.
21510_17_ITEM7_P73_S0	The Market approach determines fair value by comparing the reporting units to comparable companies in similar lines of business that are publicly traded.
21510_17_ITEM7_P73_S1	Total Enterprise Value (TEV) multiples such as TEV to revenues and TEV to earnings (if applicable) before interest and taxes of the publicly traded companies are calculated.
21510_17_ITEM7_P73_S2	These multiples are then applied to the reporting unit's operating results to obtain an estimate of fair value.
21510_17_ITEM7_P73_S3	Each of these two approaches captures aspects of value in each reporting unit.
21510_17_ITEM7_P73_S4	The Income approach captures our expected future performance, and the Market approach captures how investors view the reporting units through other competitors.
21510_17_ITEM7_P73_S5	We believe these valuation approaches are proven valuation techniques and methodologies for our industry and are widely accepted by investors.
21510_17_ITEM7_P73_S6	As neither was perceived by us to deliver any greater indication of value than the other, and neither approach individually computed a fair value less than the carrying value of the segment, we weighted each of the approaches equally.
21510_17_ITEM7_P73_S7	Management completed and reviewed the results of the Step 1 analysis and concluded that an impairment charge was not required as the estimated fair value of the ILS reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value.
21510_17_ITEM7_P73_S8	Between the completion of that testing and the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we noted no indications of impairment or triggering events for either reporting unit to cause us to review goodwill for potential impairment.
21510_17_ITEM7_P73_S9	At September 30, 2017 , we had $417.7 million of goodwill ( $102.2 million OLS and $315.5 million in ILS), $190.0 million of purchased intangible assets and $278.9 million of property and equipment on our consolidated balance sheet.
21510_17_ITEM7_P74_S0	Inventory Valuation We record our inventory at the lower of cost (computed on a first-in, first-out basis) or market.
21510_17_ITEM7_P74_S1	We write-down our inventory to its estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
21510_17_ITEM7_P74_S2	Inventory write-downs are generally recorded within guidelines set by management when the inventory for a device exceeds 12 months of its demand or when management has deemed parts are no longer active or useful.
21510_17_ITEM7_P74_S3	If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required which could materially affect our future results of operations.
21510_17_ITEM7_P74_S4	Due to rapidly changing forecasts and orders, additional write-downs for excess or obsolete inventory, while not currently expected, could be required in the future.
21510_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	down inventories are identified, we may experience better than normal profit margins when such inventory is sold.
21510_17_ITEM7_P75_S1	Differences between actual results and previous estimates of excess and obsolete inventory could materially affect our future results of operations.
21510_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	We write-down our demo inventory by amortizing the cost of demo inventory over periods ranging from 24 to 36 months after such inventory is placed in service.
21510_17_ITEM7_P76_S1	We provide warranties on the majority of our product sales and allowances for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale.
21510_17_ITEM7_P76_S2	The determination of such allowances requires us to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty.
21510_17_ITEM7_P76_S3	We currently establish warranty reserves based on historical warranty costs for each product line.
21510_17_ITEM7_P76_S4	The weighted average warranty period covered is approximately 15 months.
21510_17_ITEM7_P76_S5	If actual return rates and/or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates, adjustments to cost of sales may be required in future periods.
21510_17_ITEM7_P77_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation using fair value.
21510_17_ITEM7_P77_S1	We estimate the fair value of performance restricted stock units granted using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
21510_17_ITEM7_P77_S2	We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.
21510_17_ITEM7_P77_S3	We value service-based restricted stock units using the intrinsic value method and amortize the value on a straight-line basis over the restriction period.
21510_17_ITEM7_P77_S4	We value performance restricted stock units using a Monte Carlo simulation model and amortize the value over the performance period, with no adjustment in future periods, based upon the actual shareholder return over the performance period.
21510_17_ITEM7_P78_S0	U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") requires the use of option pricing models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options.
21510_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short-lived exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
21510_17_ITEM7_P79_S1	In addition, option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the options expected life, the expected price volatility of the underlying stock and an estimate of expected forfeitures.
21510_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	Our computation of expected volatility considers historical volatility and market-based implied volatility.
21510_17_ITEM7_P80_S1	Our estimate of expected forfeitures is based on historical employee data and could differ from actual forfeitures.
21510_17_ITEM7_P80_S2	See Note 12, "Employee Stock Award and Benefit Plans" in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our stock-based employee compensation plans and the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of stock-based employee compensation.
21510_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income tax provision (benefit) in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
21510_17_ITEM7_P81_S1	This process involves us estimating our current income tax provision (benefit) together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
21510_17_ITEM7_P81_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets.
21510_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized.
21510_17_ITEM7_P82_S1	While we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made.
21510_17_ITEM7_P82_S2	Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.
21510_17_ITEM7_P82_S3	During fiscal 2017, we increased our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by $11.1 million to $28.7 million, primarily due to the increase in California and certain state research and development tax credits and the release of R D tax reserves for California and other states, which are not expected to be recognized.
21510_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	The Company had U.S. federal deferred tax assets related to research and development credits, foreign tax credits and other tax attributes that can be used to offset federal taxable income in future periods.
21510_17_ITEM7_P83_S1	These credit carryforwards will expire if they are not used within certain time periods.
21510_17_ITEM7_P83_S2	As of September 30, 2017, management determined that there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not sufficient taxable income will exist in the future allowing us to recognize these deferred tax assets.
21510_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	Federal and state income taxes have not been provided on a portion of the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested.
21510_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	The amount of federal and state income taxes that would be payable upon repatriation of such earnings is not practicably determinable.
21510_17_ITEM7_P85_S1	We have not, nor do we anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the United States to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Interest rate sensitivity A portion of our investment portfolio is composed of fixed income securities.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P1_S2	If interest rates were to increase immediately (whether due to changes in overall market rates or credit worthiness of the issuers of our individual securities) and uniformly by 10% from levels at fiscal 2017 year-end, the fair value of the portfolio, based on quoted market prices in active markets involving similar assets, would decline by an immaterial amount due to their short-term maturities.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P1_S3	We have the ability to generally hold our fixed income investments until maturity and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P1_S4	If necessary, we may sell short-term investments prior to maturity to meet our liquidity needs.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P1_S5	At fiscal 2017 year-end, the fair value of our available-for-sale debt securities was $69.5 million , $37.0 million of which was classified as cash and cash equivalents and $32.5 million of which was classified as short-term investments.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P1_S6	At fiscal 2016 year-end, the fair value of our available-for-sale debt securities was $25.1 million, all of which was classified as short-term investments.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P1_S7	There were no gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities at fiscal 2017 or 2016 year-end.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates related to our Euro Term Loan.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P2_S1	As of September 30, 2017 , we owed $606.7 million on this loan with an interest rate of 3.0% .
21510_17_ITEM7A_P2_S2	We performed a sensitivity analysis on the outstanding portion of our debt obligation as of September 30, 2017 .
21510_17_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Should the current average interest rate increase or decrease by 10%, the resulting annual increase or decrease to interest expense would be approximately $1.8 million as of September 30, 2017 .
21510_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Foreign currency exchange risk We maintain operations in various countries outside of the United States and have foreign subsidiaries that manufacture and sell our products in various global markets.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The majority of our sales are transacted in U.S. dollars.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P3_S2	However, we do generate revenues in other currencies, primarily the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the South Korean Won and the Chinese RMB.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P3_S3	Additionally, we have operations in different countries around the world with costs incurred in other local currencies, such as British Pound Sterling, Singapore Dollars and Malaysian Ringgit.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P3_S4	As a result, our earnings, cash flows and cash balances are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P3_S5	For example, because of our significant manufacturing operations in Europe, a weakening Euro is advantageous to our financial results.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P3_S6	We attempt to limit these exposures through financial market instruments.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P3_S7	We utilize derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts with maturities of two months or less, to manage our exposure associated with anticipated cash flows and net asset and liability positions denominated in foreign currencies.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P3_S8	Gains and losses on the forward contracts are mitigated by gains and losses on the underlying instruments.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P4_S1	On occasion, we enter into currency forward exchange contracts to hedge specific anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions generally expected to occur within the next 12 months.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P4_S2	These cash flow hedges are designated for hedge accounting treatment and gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholder's equity and reclassified into earnings at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized in earnings.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P4_S3	See Note 6, "Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities".
21510_17_ITEM7A_P5_S0	On August 1, 2016, we purchased forward contracts totaling 670.0 million Euro, with a value date of November 30, 2016, to limit our foreign exchange risk related to the commitment of our term loan (denominated in Euros) in an amount of the Euro equivalent of $750.0 million to finance the U.S. dollar payment for the acquisition of Rofin.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P5_S1	In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we recognized an unrealized loss of $2.2 million on these hedges.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Subsequent to October 1, 2016, we settled these hedges at a net gain of $3.1 million, resulting in a realized gain of $5.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P6_S0	See Note 6, "Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of this annual report.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P6_S1	We do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P7_S0	transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P7_S1	While we model currency valuations and fluctuations, these may not ultimately be accurate.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P7_S2	If a financial counterparty to any of our hedging arrangements experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge, we may experience material financial losses.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P8_S0	In the current economic environment, the risk of failure of a financial party remains high.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P9_S0	At September 30, 2017 , approximately $300.0 million of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were held outside the U.S. in certain of our foreign operations, $263.2 million of which was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P9_S1	See Note 3, "Business Combinations" in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of this annual report for further discussion of the completion of our acquisition of Rofin and the use of cash to finance the acquisition.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P10_S0	A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency rates on our forward contracts would not have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P11_S0	The following table provides information about our foreign exchange forward contracts at September 30, 2017 .
21510_17_ITEM7A_P11_S1	The table presents the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates, the value of the contracts in U.S. dollars at the contract exchange rate as of the contract maturity date and fair value.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P11_S2	The U.S. fair value represents the fair value of the contracts valued at September 30, 2017 rates.
21510_17_ITEM7A_P12_S0	Forward contracts to sell (buy) foreign currencies (in thousands, except contract rates):
21510_17_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by this annual report ("Evaluation Date").
21510_17_ITEM9A_P0_S1	The controls evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.
21510_17_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
21510_17_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the Company.
21510_17_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2017 , utilizing the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).
21510_17_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on the assessment by management, we determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2017 .
21510_17_ITEM9A_P1_S3	The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2017 has been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears below.
21510_17_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Inherent Limitations Over Internal Controls Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
21510_17_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
21510_17_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
21510_17_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
21510_17_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
21510_17_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud.
21510_17_ITEM9A_P4_S0	A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
21510_17_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
21510_17_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
21510_17_ITEM9A_P4_S3	Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
21510_17_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting In November 2016, we completed the acquisition of Rofin-Sinar Technologies, Inc. ( Rofin ).

21510_17_ITEM9A_P7_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Coherent, Inc.
21510_17_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Santa Clara, CA We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Coherent, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") as of September 30, 2017 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
21510_17_ITEM9A_P7_S2	The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
21510_17_ITEM9A_P7_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
21510_17_ITEM9A_P7_S4	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
21510_17_ITEM9A_P7_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
21510_17_ITEM9A_P7_S6	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
21510_17_ITEM9A_P7_S7	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
21510_17_ITEM9A_P8_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
21510_17_ITEM9A_P8_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
21510_17_ITEM9A_P8_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
21510_17_ITEM9A_P8_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
21510_17_ITEM9A_P8_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2017 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
21510_17_ITEM9A_P8_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2017 , of the Company and our report dated November 28, 2017 , expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

21510_17_ITEM15_P19_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
21510_17_ITEM15_P19_S3	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
21510_17_ITEM15_P19_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
21510_17_ITEM15_P20_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

21510_17_ITEM15_P25_S0	DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Founded in 1966, Coherent, Inc. provides lasers, laser-based technologies and laser-based system solutions in a broad range of commercial, industrial and scientific research applications.
21510_17_ITEM15_P25_S1	Coherent designs, manufactures, services and markets lasers and related accessories for a diverse group of customers.
21510_17_ITEM15_P25_S2	Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, the Company has worldwide operations including research and development, manufacturing, sales, service and support capabilities.
21510_17_ITEM15_P26_S0	Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30.
21510_17_ITEM15_P26_S1	Fiscal years 2017 , 2016 and 2015 ended on September 30, 2017 , October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015 , respectively, and are referred to in these financial statements as fiscal 2017 , fiscal 2016 , and fiscal 2015 for convenience.
21510_17_ITEM15_P26_S2	Fiscal years 2017 and 2016 include 52 weeks and fiscal year 2015 includes 53 weeks.
21510_17_ITEM15_P26_S3	The fiscal years of the majority of our international subsidiaries end on September 30.
21510_17_ITEM15_P26_S4	Accordingly, the financial statements of these subsidiaries as of that date and for the years then ended have been used for our consolidated financial statements.
21510_17_ITEM15_P26_S5	Management believes that the impact of the use of different year-ends is immaterial to our consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.
21510_17_ITEM15_P27_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
21510_17_ITEM15_P27_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
21510_17_ITEM15_P28_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Coherent, Inc. and its direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company", "we", "our", "us" or "Coherent").
21510_17_ITEM15_P28_S1	Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
21510_17_ITEM15_P29_S0	We include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the respective dates of acquisition.
21510_17_ITEM15_P29_S1	We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our business acquisitions to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, based on their estimated fair values.
21510_17_ITEM15_P29_S2	The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.
21510_17_ITEM15_P30_S0	On November 7, 2016, we acquired Rofin-Sinar Technologies, Inc. and its direct and indirect subsidiaries ("Rofin").
21510_17_ITEM15_P30_S1	The significant accounting policies of Rofin have been aligned to conform to those of Coherent, and the consolidated financial statements include the results of Rofin as of the acquisition date.
21510_17_ITEM15_P31_S0	The carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments including accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
21510_17_ITEM15_P32_S0	Short-term investments are comprised of available-for-sale securities, which are carried at fair value.
21510_17_ITEM15_P32_S1	Other non-current assets include trading securities and life insurance contracts related to our deferred compensation plans; trading securities are carried at fair value and life insurance contracts are carried at cash surrender values, which due to their ability to be converted to cash at that amount, approximate their fair values.
21510_17_ITEM15_P33_S0	Foreign exchange contracts are stated at fair value based on prevailing financial market information.
21510_17_ITEM15_P33_S1	Short-term and long-term debt is carried at amortized cost, which approximates its fair value based on borrowing rates currently available to us for loans with similar terms.
21510_17_ITEM15_P34_S0	Cash Equivalents All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.
21510_17_ITEM15_P34_S1	At fiscal 2017 year-end, cash and cash equivalents included cash, money market funds, commercial paper and U.S. agency obligations.
21510_17_ITEM15_P35_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2.
21510_17_ITEM15_P36_S0	Financial instruments that may potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable.
21510_17_ITEM15_P36_S1	At fiscal 2017 year-end, the majority of our short-term investments were in U.S. Treasury and agency obligations and corporate notes and obligations.
21510_17_ITEM15_P36_S2	Cash equivalents and short-term investments are maintained with several financial institutions and may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such balances.
21510_17_ITEM15_P36_S3	At September 30, 2017 , we held cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments outside the U.S. in certain of our foreign operations totaling approximately $300.0 million , $263.2 million of which was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
21510_17_ITEM15_P37_S0	The majority of our accounts receivable are derived from sales to customers for commercial applications.
21510_17_ITEM15_P37_S1	We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition and limit the amount of credit extended when deemed necessary but generally require no collateral.
21510_17_ITEM15_P37_S2	In certain instances, we may require customers to issue a letter of credit.
21510_17_ITEM15_P37_S3	We maintain reserves for potential credit losses.
21510_17_ITEM15_P37_S4	Our products are broadly distributed and there was one customer who accounted for 19.0% and 18.0% of accounts receivable at fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 year-end.
21510_17_ITEM15_P37_S5	We had another customer who accounted for 18.7% of accounts receivable at fiscal 2016 year-end.
21510_17_ITEM15_P38_S0	Our primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate risk.
21510_17_ITEM15_P38_S1	Principal currencies hedged include the Euro, South Korean Won, Japanese Yen, Chinese Renminbi, Singapore Dollar, British Pound and Malaysian Ringgit.
21510_17_ITEM15_P39_S0	Our derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value, on a gross basis, and are included in other current assets and other current liabilities.
21510_17_ITEM15_P39_S1	Our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments are based on whether they meet the criteria for designation as a cash flow hedge.
21510_17_ITEM15_P39_S2	Changes in the fair value of these cash flow hedges that are highly effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same line item on the consolidated statements of operations as the impact of the hedged transaction during the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
21510_17_ITEM15_P40_S0	The ineffective portion of cash flow hedges are recognized immediately in other income and expenses.
21510_17_ITEM15_P41_S0	Derivatives that we designate as cash flow hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the same section as the underlying item, primarily within cash flows from operating activities.
21510_17_ITEM15_P41_S1	The changes in fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges are recognized immediately in other income (expense).
21510_17_ITEM15_P41_S2	We formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
21510_17_ITEM15_P42_S0	This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as cash-flow hedges to specific forecasted transactions.
21510_17_ITEM15_P42_S1	We also assess, both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items.
21510_17_ITEM15_P43_S0	Accounts Receivable Allowances Accounts receivable allowances reflect our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our accounts receivable balances, including both losses for uncollectible accounts receivable and sales returns.
21510_17_ITEM15_P44_S0	We regularly review allowances by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality, the age of the accounts receivable balances and current economic conditions that may affect a customer's ability to pay.
21510_17_ITEM15_P45_S0	Activity in accounts receivable allowance is as follows (in thousands):

21510_17_ITEM15_P47_S1	Inventories are as follows (in thousands):
21510_17_ITEM15_P48_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method.
21510_17_ITEM15_P48_S1	Cost, accumulated depreciation and amortization, and estimated useful lives are as follows (dollars in thousands):
21510_17_ITEM15_P49_S0	The fair value (the present value of estimated cash flows) of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.
21510_17_ITEM15_P49_S1	The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset.
21510_17_ITEM15_P49_S2	All of our existing asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return the property to its original condition upon lease termination at various sites and costs to clean up and dispose of certain fixed assets at our Sunnyvale, California site.
21510_17_ITEM15_P49_S3	We estimated that as of fiscal 2017 year-end, gross expected future cash flows of $6.1 million would be required to fulfill these obligations.
21510_17_ITEM15_P49_S4	The following table reconciles changes in our asset retirement liability for fiscal 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):
21510_17_ITEM15_P50_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2.
21510_17_ITEM15_P51_S0	At September 30, 2017 and October 1, 2016 , the asset retirement liability is included in Other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
21510_17_ITEM15_P52_S0	Long-lived Assets We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, whenever events or changes in business circumstances or our planned use of long-lived assets indicate that their carrying amounts may not be fully recoverable or that their useful lives are no longer appropriate.
21510_17_ITEM15_P52_S1	Reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying values of long-lived assets are impaired based on a comparison to the undiscounted expected future net cash flows.
21510_17_ITEM15_P52_S2	If the comparison indicates that impairment exists, long-lived assets that are classified as held and used are written down to their respective fair values.
21510_17_ITEM15_P53_S0	When long-lived assets are classified as held for sale, they are written down to their respective fair values less costs to sell.
21510_17_ITEM15_P53_S1	Significant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that is used in the preparation of expected undiscounted cash flows.
21510_17_ITEM15_P54_S0	For fiscal 2017 , we recorded a $2.9 million impairment charge on the net assets of several entities acquired in the acquisition of Rofin to write them down to reflect our best estimate of fair value, less costs to sell (See Note 18, "Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale").
21510_17_ITEM15_P54_S1	In fiscal 2016, there were no significant asset impairments recorded.
21510_17_ITEM15_P54_S2	In fiscal 2015, we recorded a $2.0 million impairment of our investment in SiOnyx in fiscal 2015.
21510_17_ITEM15_P54_S3	Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and written down when impaired (See Note 7, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets").
21510_17_ITEM15_P55_S0	In testing for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
21510_17_ITEM15_P55_S1	Moreover, an entity can bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to the impairment test, and then resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period.
21510_17_ITEM15_P55_S2	In both our fiscal 2017 and 2016 annual testing, we performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill for our OLS reporting unit using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and noted no impairment.
21510_17_ITEM15_P55_S3	For the ILS reporting unit, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the goodwill impairment test.
21510_17_ITEM15_P55_S4	Accordingly, we performed our impairment test using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and noted no impairment in both fiscal 2017 and 2016.
21510_17_ITEM15_P56_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets, including acquired existing technology, customer relationships, trade name and patents are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, currently 3 year to 15 years (See Note 7, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets").
21510_17_ITEM15_P56_S1	We provide warranties on the majority of our product sales and reserves for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale.
21510_17_ITEM15_P56_S2	The determination of such reserves requires us to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty.
21510_17_ITEM15_P56_S3	We currently establish warranty reserves based on historical warranty costs for each product line.
21510_17_ITEM15_P56_S4	The weighted average warranty period covered is approximately 15 months .
21510_17_ITEM15_P56_S5	If actual return rates and/or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates, adjustments to cost of sales may be required in future periods.
21510_17_ITEM15_P57_S0	Components of the reserve for warranty costs during fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 were as follows (in thousands):

21510_17_ITEM15_P59_S0	Loss Contingencies We are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business.
21510_17_ITEM15_P59_S1	We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset, or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies.
21510_17_ITEM15_P59_S2	An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.
21510_17_ITEM15_P59_S3	If we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined, then we disclose the range of the possible loss.
21510_17_ITEM15_P59_S4	We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted or a range of possible loss should be disclosed.
21510_17_ITEM15_P60_S0	When a sales arrangement contains multiple elements, such as products and/or services, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy.
21510_17_ITEM15_P60_S1	Using the selling price hierarchy, we determine the selling price of each deliverable using vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ), if it exists, and otherwise third-party evidence ( TPE ).
21510_17_ITEM15_P60_S2	If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exists, we use estimated selling price ( ESP ).
21510_17_ITEM15_P60_S3	We generally expect that we will not be able to establish TPE due to the nature of the markets in which we compete, and, as such, we typically will determine selling price using VSOE or if not available, ESP.
21510_17_ITEM15_P61_S0	Our basis for establishing VSOE of a deliverable's selling price consists of standalone sales transactions when the same or similar product or service is sold separately.
21510_17_ITEM15_P61_S1	However, when services are never sold separately, such as product installation services, VSOE is based on the product's estimated installation hours based on historical experience multiplied by the standard service billing rate.
21510_17_ITEM15_P62_S0	In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling price for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow price range, as defined by us.
21510_17_ITEM15_P62_S1	We also consider the geographies in which the products or services are sold, major product and service groups, and other environmental variables in determining VSOE.
21510_17_ITEM15_P62_S2	Absent the existence of VSOE and TPE, our determination of a deliverable's ESP involves evaluating several factors based on the specific facts and circumstances of these arrangements, which include pricing strategy and policies driven by geographies, market conditions, competitive landscape, correlation between proportionate selling price and list price established by management having the relevant authority, and other environmental variables in which the deliverable is sold.
21510_17_ITEM15_P63_S0	For multiple element arrangements which include extended maintenance contracts, we allocate and defer the amount of consideration equal to the separately stated price and recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
21510_17_ITEM15_P63_S1	We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered or the service has been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured.
21510_17_ITEM15_P63_S2	Revenue from product sales is recorded when all of the foregoing conditions are met and risk of loss and title passes to the customer.
21510_17_ITEM15_P63_S3	Sales to customers are generally not subject to any price protection or return rights.
21510_17_ITEM15_P64_S0	The majority of our sales are made to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), distributors, representatives and end-users in the non-scientific market.
21510_17_ITEM15_P64_S1	Sales made to these customers do not require installation of the products by us and are not subject to other post-delivery obligations, except in occasional instances where we have agreed to perform installation or provide training.
21510_17_ITEM15_P64_S2	In those instances, we defer revenue related to installation services or training until these services have been rendered.
21510_17_ITEM15_P64_S3	We allocate revenue from multiple element arrangements to the various elements based upon relative fair values.
21510_17_ITEM15_P64_S4	Our sales to distributors, representatives and end-user customers typically do not have customer acceptance provisions and only certain of our sales to OEM customers and integrators have customer acceptance provisions.

21510_17_ITEM15_P66_S1	For the few product sales that have customer acceptance provisions because of higher than published specifications, (1) the products are tested and accepted by the customer at our site or the customer accepts the results of our testing program prior to shipment to the customer, or (2) the revenue is deferred until customer acceptance occurs.
21510_17_ITEM15_P67_S0	Sales to end-users in the scientific market typically require installation and, thus, involve post-delivery obligations; however, our post-delivery installation obligations are not essential to the functionality of our products.
21510_17_ITEM15_P67_S1	We defer revenue related to installation services until completion of these services.
21510_17_ITEM15_P68_S0	For most products, training is not provided; therefore, no post-delivery training obligation exists.
21510_17_ITEM15_P68_S1	However, when training is provided to our customers, it is typically priced separately and is recognized as revenue as these services are provided.
21510_17_ITEM15_P69_S0	We record taxes collected on revenue-producing activities on a net basis.
21510_17_ITEM15_P69_S1	Research and Development Research and development expenses include salaries, contractor and consultant fees, supplies and materials, as well as costs related to other overhead such as depreciation, facilities, utilities and other departmental expenses.
21510_17_ITEM15_P69_S2	The costs we incur with respect to internally developed technology and engineering services are included in research and development expenses as incurred as they do not directly relate to any particular licensee, license agreement or license fee.
21510_17_ITEM15_P69_S3	We treat third party and government funding of our research and development activity, where we are the primary beneficiary of such work conducted, as a reduction of research and development cost.
21510_17_ITEM15_P69_S4	Research and development reimbursements of $2.9 million , $2.7 million and $2.5 million were offset against research and development costs in fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
21510_17_ITEM15_P70_S0	The functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are generally their respective local currencies.
21510_17_ITEM15_P70_S1	Accordingly, gains and losses from the translation of the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income ("OCI").
21510_17_ITEM15_P70_S2	Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in earnings.
21510_17_ITEM15_P71_S0	Comprehensive Income (Loss) Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources.
21510_17_ITEM15_P71_S1	Accumulated other comprehensive income (net of tax) at fiscal 2017 year-end is substantially comprised of accumulated translation adjustments of $16.3 million and deferred actuarial gains on pension plans of $3.6 million .
21510_17_ITEM15_P71_S2	Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (net of tax) at fiscal 2016 year-end is substantially comprised of accumulated translation adjustments of $(8.6) million and unrealized gain on marketable equity securities of $ 3.3 million .

21510_17_ITEM15_P73_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period, excluding unvested restricted stock.
21510_17_ITEM15_P73_S1	Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period increased by the effect of dilutive employee stock awards, including stock options, restricted stock awards and stock purchase contracts, using the treasury stock method.
21510_17_ITEM15_P73_S2	The following table presents information necessary to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share (in thousands, except per share data):
21510_17_ITEM15_P74_S0	There were 505 , 323 and 0 potentially dilutive securities excluded from the dilutive share calculation for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively, as their effect was anti-dilutive.
21510_17_ITEM15_P75_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation using the fair value of the awards granted.
21510_17_ITEM15_P75_S1	We value restricted stock units using the intrinsic value method, which is based on the fair market value price on the grant date.
21510_17_ITEM15_P75_S2	We use a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the fair value of performance restricted stock units.
21510_17_ITEM15_P76_S0	We amortize the fair value of stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods.
21510_17_ITEM15_P76_S1	See Note 12, "Employee Stock Award and Benefit Plans" for a description of our stock-based employee compensation plans and the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of stock-based employee compensation.
21510_17_ITEM15_P77_S0	We record costs related to shipping and handling of net sales in cost of sales for all periods presented.
21510_17_ITEM15_P77_S1	Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are included in net sales.
21510_17_ITEM15_P77_S2	Custom duties billed to customers are recorded in cost of sales.
21510_17_ITEM15_P78_S0	Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income tax provision (benefit) in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
21510_17_ITEM15_P78_S1	This process involves us estimating our current income tax provision (benefit) together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
21510_17_ITEM15_P78_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets.
21510_17_ITEM15_P79_S0	We account for uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740-10 Income Taxes , which creates a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.
21510_17_ITEM15_P79_S1	This standard provides a two-step approach for evaluating tax positions.
21510_17_ITEM15_P79_S2	The first step, recognition, occurs when a company concludes (based solely on the technical aspects of the matter) that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority.
21510_17_ITEM15_P79_S3	The second step, measurement, is only considered after step one has been satisfied and measures any tax benefit at the largest amount that is deemed more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the uncertainty.
21510_17_ITEM15_P79_S4	These determinations involve significant judgment by management.
21510_17_ITEM15_P79_S5	Tax positions that fail to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first subsequent interim period that they meet the more likely than not standard or when they are resolved through negotiation or litigation with factual interpretation, judgment and certainty.
21510_17_ITEM15_P80_S0	Tax laws and regulations themselves are complex and are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, evolution of regulations and court filings.
21510_17_ITEM15_P81_S0	Therefore, the actual liability for U.S.

21510_17_ITEM15_P83_S0	or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially to reverse previously recorded tax liabilities.
21510_17_ITEM15_P84_S0	We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized.
21510_17_ITEM15_P84_S1	While we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made.
21510_17_ITEM15_P84_S2	Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.
21510_17_ITEM15_P85_S0	Federal and state income taxes have not been provided on a portion of the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested.
21510_17_ITEM15_P85_S1	The total amount of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which we have not yet recorded federal and state income taxes was approximately $1,150 million and $574 million at fiscal 2017 and 2016 year-end, respectively.
21510_17_ITEM15_P85_S2	The amount of federal and state income taxes that would be payable upon repatriation of such earnings is not practicably determinable.
21510_17_ITEM15_P85_S3	We have not, nor do we anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the United States to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business.
21510_17_ITEM15_P85_S4	In January 2017, the FASB issued amended guidance that simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.
21510_17_ITEM15_P85_S5	Under the existing guidance, when computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, an entity is required to perform procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.
21510_17_ITEM15_P85_S6	Under the amendments in this update, an entity should simply perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.
21510_17_ITEM15_P85_S7	An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value.
21510_17_ITEM15_P85_S8	The new standard will become effective for our fiscal year 2021 which begins on October 4, 2020.
21510_17_ITEM15_P85_S9	We elected to early adopt the standard in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and the adoption resulted in no impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
21510_17_ITEM15_P86_S0	In November 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance that require a statement of cash flows to explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents.
21510_17_ITEM15_P86_S1	Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows.
21510_17_ITEM15_P86_S2	The new standard will become effective for our fiscal year beginning September 30, 2018.
21510_17_ITEM15_P86_S3	We elected to early adopt the standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 on a retrospective basis with no impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
21510_17_ITEM15_P87_S0	In April 2015, the FASB issued amended guidance that simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.
21510_17_ITEM15_P87_S1	The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amended guidance.
21510_17_ITEM15_P87_S2	The new standard became effective for our fiscal year beginning October 2, 2016.
21510_17_ITEM15_P87_S3	We elected to early adopt the standard in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and had recorded debt issuance costs of $5.2 million in Other assets as of October 1, 2016 for the debt commitment we entered into in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 because the debt was not outstanding as of October 1, 2016.
21510_17_ITEM15_P87_S4	The debt issuance costs related to the term loan facility were reclassified to debt in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 when we drew down the debt.
21510_17_ITEM15_P88_S0	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In August 2017, the FASB issued amended guidance to address current U.S. GAAP's limitation on how an entity can designate the hedged risk in certain cash flow and fair value hedging relationships.
21510_17_ITEM15_P88_S1	This amendment better aligns the entity's risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships through changes to both designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results.
21510_17_ITEM15_P88_S2	The amendment made specific improvements on hedge accounting for risk components in hedging relationships involving nonfinancial risk and interest rate risk for cash flow hedges of forecasted purchases or sales of a nonfinancial asset, cash flow hedges of interest rate risk of variable-rate financial instruments and fair value hedges of interest rate risk.

21510_17_ITEM15_P90_S1	The amended presentation and disclosure guidance is required only prospectively.
21510_17_ITEM15_P90_S2	The new standard will become effective for our fiscal year 2020 which begins on September 29, 2019.
21510_17_ITEM15_P90_S3	We are currently assessing the impact of this amended guidance.
21510_17_ITEM15_P91_S0	In May 2017, the FASB issued amended guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment require an entity to apply modification accounting.
21510_17_ITEM15_P91_S1	Under the new guidance, an entity should account for the effects of a modification unless, comparing to the original award prior to modification, the fair value, the vesting conditions and the classification as equity or as a liability of the modified award are all the same.
21510_17_ITEM15_P91_S2	The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively to an award modified on or after the adoption date.
21510_17_ITEM15_P91_S3	The new standard will become effective for our fiscal year 2019 which begins on September 30, 2018.
21510_17_ITEM15_P91_S4	We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial statements.
21510_17_ITEM15_P92_S0	In October 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance that improves the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.
21510_17_ITEM15_P92_S1	Under the new guidance, an entity should recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs.
21510_17_ITEM15_P92_S2	The new standard will become effective in the first quarter of our fiscal 2019.
21510_17_ITEM15_P92_S3	We are currently assessing the impact of this amended guidance and are planning to adopt it in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
21510_17_ITEM15_P92_S4	In May 2016, accounting guidance was issued to clarify the not yet effective revenue recognition guidance issued in May 2014.
21510_17_ITEM15_P92_S5	This additional guidance does not change the core principle of the revenue recognition guidance issued in May 2014, rather, it provides clarification of accounting for collections of sales taxes as well as recognition of revenue (i) associated with contract modifications, (ii) for noncash consideration, and (iii) based on the collectability of the consideration from the customer.
21510_17_ITEM15_P92_S6	The guidance also specifies when a contract should be considered completed for purposes of applying the transition guidance.
21510_17_ITEM15_P92_S7	The effective date and transition requirements for this guidance are the same as the effective date and transition requirements for the guidance previously issued in 2014, which is effective for our fiscal year 2019 which begins on September 30, 2018.
21510_17_ITEM15_P92_S8	We are currently evaluating the new guidance and have not determined the impact this standard may have on our financial statements nor have we decided upon the method of adoption.
21510_17_ITEM15_P93_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance that simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows.
21510_17_ITEM15_P93_S1	Under the new guidance, an entity recognizes all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement.
21510_17_ITEM15_P93_S2	This change eliminates the notion of the APIC pool and significantly reduces the complexity and cost of accounting for excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies.
21510_17_ITEM15_P93_S3	The new standard will become effective for our fiscal year beginning October 1, 2017.
21510_17_ITEM15_P93_S4	Upon our adoption in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we expect to recognize a windfall tax benefit as a cumulative effect adjustment increase to our opening retained earnings of approximately $20.0 million together with a comparable increase in deferred tax assets.
21510_17_ITEM15_P94_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.
21510_17_ITEM15_P94_S1	The new guidance clarifies the criteria for distinguishing between a finance lease and operating lease, as well as classification between the two types of leases, which is substantially unchanged from the previous lease guidance.
21510_17_ITEM15_P94_S2	Further, the new guidance requires a lessee to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments.
21510_17_ITEM15_P94_S3	For finance leases, a lessee should recognize interest on the lease liability separately from amortization of the right-of-use asset.
21510_17_ITEM15_P94_S4	For operating leases, a lessee should recognize a single lease cost, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term on a generally straight-line basis.
21510_17_ITEM15_P94_S5	For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities.
21510_17_ITEM15_P94_S6	The new standard will become effective for our fiscal year 2020 which begins on September 29, 2019.
21510_17_ITEM15_P94_S7	We are currently assessing the impact of this amended guidance and the timing of adoption.
21510_17_ITEM15_P95_S0	In January 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance that revises the recognition and measurement of financial instruments.

21510_17_ITEM15_P98_S0	BUSINESS COMBINATIONS Fiscal 2017 Acquisitions Rofin On November 7, 2016, we completed our acquisition of Rofin pursuant to the Merger Agreement dated March 16, 2016.
21510_17_ITEM15_P99_S0	Rofin is one of the world's leading developers and manufacturers of high-performance industrial laser sources and laser-based solutions and components.
21510_17_ITEM15_P99_S1	Rofin's operating results have been included primarily in our Industrial Lasers Systems segment.
21510_17_ITEM15_P99_S2	See Note 16, "Segment and Geographic Information".
21510_17_ITEM15_P99_S3	As a condition of the acquisition, we were required to divest and hold separate Rofin s low power CO 2 laser business based in Hull, United Kingdom (the "Hull Business"), and have reported this business separately as a discontinued operation until its divestiture (See Note 18, "Discontinued Operations").
21510_17_ITEM15_P99_S4	We completed the divestiture of the Hull Business on October 11, 2017, after receiving approval for the terms of the sale from the European Commission.
21510_17_ITEM15_P100_S0	The total purchase consideration has been allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on a valuation analysis.
21510_17_ITEM15_P100_S1	The total purchase consideration allocated to net assets acquired was approximately $936.3 million and consisted of the following (in thousands):
21510_17_ITEM15_P101_S0	The acquisition was an all-cash transaction at a price of $32.50 per share of Rofin common stock.
21510_17_ITEM15_P101_S1	We funded the payment of the aggregate consideration with a combination of our available cash on hand and the proceeds from the Euro Term Loan described in Note 9.
21510_17_ITEM15_P101_S2	The total payment of $15.3 million due to the cancellation of options held by employees of Rofin was allocated between total estimated merger consideration of $11.1 million and post-merger stock-based compensation expense of $4.2 million based on the portion of the total service period of the underlying options that had not been completed by the merger date.
21510_17_ITEM15_P101_S3	We recognized a gain of $5.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 on the increase in fair value from the date of purchase for the shares of Rofin we owned before the acquisition.
21510_17_ITEM15_P102_S0	Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total estimated acquisition consideration is allocated to the acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities of Rofin based on their fair values as of the acquisition date.
21510_17_ITEM15_P102_S1	Any excess of the acquisition consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill.
21510_17_ITEM15_P102_S2	We expect that all such goodwill will not be deductible for tax purposes.
21510_17_ITEM15_P103_S0	In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we re-evaluated the carrying value of the Hull Business that has been presented as assets held for sale since the acquisition.
21510_17_ITEM15_P103_S1	As a result, approximately $33.9 million of goodwill was reallocated from the assets held for sale to the remaining business acquired as we were within the remeasurement period.
21510_17_ITEM15_P103_S2	Our allocation of the purchase price is as follows (in thousands):
21510_17_ITEM15_P104_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 3.
21510_17_ITEM15_P105_S0	The fair value write-up of acquired finished goods and work-in-process inventory was $26.4 million which was amortized over the expected period during which the acquired inventory was sold, or 6 months.
21510_17_ITEM15_P105_S1	Accordingly, for the year ended September 30, 2017 , we recorded $26.4 million of incremental cost of sales associated with the fair value write-up of inventory acquired in the merger with Rofin.
21510_17_ITEM15_P105_S2	The fair value write-up of inventory acquired was fully amortized as of September 30, 2017 .
21510_17_ITEM15_P105_S3	The fair value write-up of acquired property, plant and equipment of $36.0 million will be amortized over the useful lives of the assets, ranging from 3 to 31 years.
21510_17_ITEM15_P105_S4	Property, plant and equipment is valued at its value-in-use, unless there was a known plan to dispose of the asset.
21510_17_ITEM15_P105_S5	The acquired existing technology, backlog, trademarks and patents are being amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the economic use of the asset, over their estimated useful lives of 3 to 5 years, 6 months, 3 years, and 5 years, respectively.
21510_17_ITEM15_P105_S6	Customer relationships are being amortized on an accelerated basis utilizing free cash flows over periods ranging from 5 to 10 years.
21510_17_ITEM15_P105_S7	The useful lives of in-process research and development will be defined in the future upon further evaluation of the status of these applications.
21510_17_ITEM15_P106_S0	The fair value of the acquired intangibles was determined using the income approach.
21510_17_ITEM15_P106_S1	In performing these valuations, the key underlying probability-adjusted assumptions of the discounted cash flows were projected revenues, gross margin expectations and operating cost estimates.
21510_17_ITEM15_P106_S2	The valuations were based on the information that was available as of the acquisition date and the expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by our management.
21510_17_ITEM15_P106_S3	There are inherent uncertainties and management judgment required in these determinations.
21510_17_ITEM15_P107_S0	This acquisition resulted in a purchase price that exceeded the estimated fair value of tangible and intangible assets, which was allocated to goodwill.
21510_17_ITEM15_P107_S1	We believe the amount of goodwill relative to identifiable intangible assets relates to several factors including: (1) potential buyer-specific synergies related to market opportunities for a combined product offering and (2) potential to leverage our sales force to attract new customers and revenue and cross sell to existing customers.
21510_17_ITEM15_P108_S0	In-process research and development ( IPR D ) consists of two projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility.

21510_17_ITEM15_P110_S1	The value assigned to IPR D was determined by considering the value of the products under development to the overall development plan, estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows to their present value.
21510_17_ITEM15_P110_S2	During the development period, these assets will not be amortized as charges to earnings; instead these assets will be subject to periodic impairment testing.
21510_17_ITEM15_P110_S3	Upon successful completion of the development process for the acquired IPR D projects, the assets would then be considered finite-lived intangible assets and amortization of the assets will commence.
21510_17_ITEM15_P110_S4	The projects have not been completed as of September 30, 2017 .
21510_17_ITEM15_P110_S5	We expensed $17.6 million of acquisition-related costs as selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations during the year ended September 30, 2017 .
21510_17_ITEM15_P110_S6	None of the goodwill was deductible for tax purposes.
21510_17_ITEM15_P110_S7	The results of this acquisition were included in our consolidated operations beginning on November 7, 2016.
21510_17_ITEM15_P110_S8	The amount of continuing Rofin net sales and net loss from continuing operations included in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended September 30, 2017 was approximately $434.9 million and $48.1 million , respectively.
21510_17_ITEM15_P111_S0	The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents our combined results of operations as if the acquisition of Rofin and the related issuance of our Euro Term Loan had occurred on October 4, 2015.
21510_17_ITEM15_P111_S1	The unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of what our consolidated results of operations actually would have been had the acquisition been completed on October 4, 2015.
21510_17_ITEM15_P111_S2	In addition, the unaudited pro forma financial information does not attempt to project the future results of operations of the combined company.
21510_17_ITEM15_P111_S3	The actual results may differ significantly from the pro forma results presented here due to many factors.
21510_17_ITEM15_P112_S0	The unaudited pro forma financial information above includes the net income of Rofin s low power CO 2 laser business based in Hull, United Kingdom, which is recorded as a discontinued operation in fiscal 2017.
21510_17_ITEM15_P113_S0	The unaudited pro forma financial information above reflects the following material adjustments:
21510_17_ITEM15_P114_S0	Incremental amortization and depreciation expense related to the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets and property, plant and equipment from the purchase price allocation.
21510_17_ITEM15_P115_S0	The exclusion of amortization of inventory step-up to its estimated fair value from fiscal 2017 and the addition of the amortization to fiscal 2016.
21510_17_ITEM15_P116_S0	The exclusion of revenue adjustments as a result of the reduction in customer deposits and deferred revenue related to its estimated fair value from fiscal 2017 and the addition of these adjustments to fiscal 2016.
21510_17_ITEM15_P117_S0	Incremental interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs related to our Euro Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility (as defined in Note 9, "Borrowings").
21510_17_ITEM15_P118_S0	The exclusion of acquisition costs incurred by both Coherent and Rofin from fiscal 2017 and the addition of these costs to fiscal 2016.
21510_17_ITEM15_P119_S0	The exclusion of a stock-based compensation charge related to the acceleration of Rofin options from fiscal 2017 and the addition of this charge to fiscal 2016.
21510_17_ITEM15_P120_S0	The exclusion of a gain on business combination for our previously owned shares of Rofin from fiscal 2017 and the addition of this gain to fiscal 2016.

21510_17_ITEM15_P124_S0	On July 24, 2015, we acquired certain assets of Raydiance, Inc. ("Raydiance") for approximately $5.0 million , excluding transaction costs.
21510_17_ITEM15_P125_S0	Raydiance manufactured complete tools and lasers for ultrafast processing systems and subsystems in the precision micromachining processing market.
21510_17_ITEM15_P125_S1	The Raydiance assets have been included in our OEM Laser Sources segment.
21510_17_ITEM15_P125_S2	Our allocation of the purchase price is as follows (in thousands):
21510_17_ITEM15_P126_S0	The purchase price allocated to goodwill was finalized in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, with an increase of $0.4 million and a corresponding decrease of $0.4 million to tangible assets, and has been updated from the preliminary allocation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
21510_17_ITEM15_P126_S1	Results of operations for the business have been included in our consolidated financial statements subsequent to the date of acquisition and pro forma results of operations in accordance with authoritative guidance for prior periods have not been presented because the effect of the acquisition was not material to our prior period consolidated financial results.
21510_17_ITEM15_P127_S0	The identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over their respective useful lives o f three to five years.
21510_17_ITEM15_P127_S1	None of the goodwill from this purchase is deductible for tax purposes.
21510_17_ITEM15_P127_S2	We expensed $0.1 million of acquisition-related costs as selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations for our fiscal year 2015.
21510_17_ITEM15_P127_S3	On July 27, 2015, we acquired the assets and certain liabilities of the Tinsley Optics ("Tinsley") business from L-3 Communications Corporation for approximately $4.3 million , excluding transaction costs.
21510_17_ITEM15_P128_S0	Tinsley is a specialized manufacturer of high precision optical components and subsystems sold primarily in the aerospace and defense industry.

21510_17_ITEM15_P130_S0	The purchase price was lower than the fair value of net assets purchased, resulting in a gain of $1.3 million recorded as a separate line item in our consolidated statements of operations for our fiscal year 2015.
21510_17_ITEM15_P130_S1	The Company reassessed the recognition and measurement of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed and concluded that all acquired assets and assumed liabilities were recognized and that the valuation procedures and resulting measures were appropriate.
21510_17_ITEM15_P130_S2	Results of operations for the business have been included in our consolidated financial statements subsequent to the date of acquisition and pro forma results of operations in accordance with authoritative guidance for prior periods have not been presented because the effect of the acquisition was not material to our prior period consolidated financial results.
21510_17_ITEM15_P131_S0	The gain from the bargain purchase is not subject to income taxation.
21510_17_ITEM15_P131_S1	We expensed $0.4 million of acquisition-related costs as selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations for our fiscal year 2015.
21510_17_ITEM15_P132_S0	We measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value.
21510_17_ITEM15_P132_S1	The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets.
21510_17_ITEM15_P132_S2	We recognize transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter.
21510_17_ITEM15_P132_S3	There were no transfers between levels during the periods presented.
21510_17_ITEM15_P133_S0	As of September 30, 2017 and October 1, 2016 , we did not have any assets or liabilities valued based on Level 3 valuations.
21510_17_ITEM15_P134_S0	We measure the fair value of outstanding debt obligations for disclosure purposes on a recurring basis.
21510_17_ITEM15_P134_S1	As of September 30, 2017, the current and long-term portion of long-term obligations of $5.1 million and $589.0 million , respectively, are reported at amortized cost.
21510_17_ITEM15_P134_S2	These outstanding obligations are classified as Level 2 as they are not actively traded and are valued using a discounted cash flow model that uses observable market inputs.

21510_17_ITEM15_P137_S1	(2) Valuations are based upon quoted market prices in active markets involving similar assets.
21510_17_ITEM15_P137_S2	The market inputs used to value these instruments generally consist of market yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.
21510_17_ITEM15_P137_S3	Pricing sources include industry standard data providers, security master files from large financial institutions, and other third party sources which are input into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine a daily market value.
21510_17_ITEM15_P137_S4	This creates a consensus price or a weighted average price for each security.
21510_17_ITEM15_P137_S5	(3) The principal market in which we execute our foreign currency contracts is the institutional market in an over-the-counter environment with a relatively high level of price transparency.
21510_17_ITEM15_P137_S6	The market participants usually are large commercial banks.
21510_17_ITEM15_P138_S0	Our foreign currency contracts valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and quoted pricing intervals from public data sources and do not involve management judgment.

21510_17_ITEM15_P140_S1	Securities traded on a national exchange are stated at the last reported sales price on the day of valuation; other securities traded in over-the-counter markets and listed securities for which no sale was reported on that date are stated as the last quoted bid price.
21510_17_ITEM15_P141_S0	SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS We consider all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.
21510_17_ITEM15_P141_S1	Investments classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of related income taxes, recorded as a separate component of OCI in stockholders' equity until realized.
21510_17_ITEM15_P141_S2	Interest and amortization of premiums and discounts for debt securities are included in interest income.
21510_17_ITEM15_P141_S3	Gains and losses on securities sold are determined based on the specific identification method and are included in other income (expense).

21510_17_ITEM15_P146_S0	During fiscal 2017 , we received proceeds totaling $0.1 million from the sale of available-for-sale securities and realized no gross gains or losses.
21510_17_ITEM15_P146_S1	During fiscal 2016 , we received proceeds totaling $126.0 million from the sale of available-for-sale securities and realized gross gains of less than $0.1 million .
21510_17_ITEM15_P147_S0	DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES We maintain operations in various countries outside of the United States and have foreign subsidiaries that manufacture and sell our products in various global markets.
21510_17_ITEM15_P147_S1	The majority of our sales are transacted in U.S. dollars.
21510_17_ITEM15_P147_S2	However, we do generate revenues in other currencies, primarily the Euro, Japanese Yen, South Korean Won and Chinese Renminbi (RMB).
21510_17_ITEM15_P147_S3	As a result, our earnings, cash flows and cash balances are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
21510_17_ITEM15_P147_S4	We attempt to limit these exposures through financial market instruments.
21510_17_ITEM15_P147_S5	We utilize derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts with maturities of two months or less, to manage our exposure associated with anticipated cash flows and net asset and liability positions denominated in foreign currencies.
21510_17_ITEM15_P147_S6	Gains and losses on the forward contracts are mitigated by gains and losses on the underlying instruments.
21510_17_ITEM15_P148_S0	We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
21510_17_ITEM15_P149_S0	The credit risk amounts represent the Company s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency rates at each respective date.
21510_17_ITEM15_P150_S0	On August 1, 2016, we purchased forward contracts totaling 670.0 million Euros, with a value date of November 30, 2016, to limit our foreign exchange risk related to the commitment of our Euro Term Loan (denominated in Euros) in an amount of the Euro equivalent of $750.0 million to finance the U.S. dollar payment for our acquisition of Rofin.
21510_17_ITEM15_P150_S1	In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we recognized an unrealized loss of $2.2 million on these forward contracts.
21510_17_ITEM15_P150_S2	In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we settled these forward contracts at a net gain of $9.1 million , resulting in a realized gain of $11.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
21510_17_ITEM15_P151_S0	Non-Designated Derivatives The outstanding notional contract and fair value asset (liability) amounts of non-designated hedge contracts, with maximum maturity of two months, are as follows (in thousands):

21510_17_ITEM15_P153_S0	The fair value of our derivative instruments is included in prepaid expenses and other assets and in other current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
21510_17_ITEM15_P153_S1	During fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, we recognized a gain of $17.8 million , a loss of $10.5 million and a loss of $4.3 million , respectively, in other income (expense) for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments.
21510_17_ITEM15_P154_S0	Designated Derivatives Cash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of the hedge when we enter into contracts for specific future transactions.
21510_17_ITEM15_P154_S1	Cash flow hedges are evaluated for effectiveness quarterly.
21510_17_ITEM15_P155_S0	The effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is reported as a component of OCI in stockholder's equity and is reclassified into earnings when the underlying transaction affects earnings.
21510_17_ITEM15_P155_S1	We had no cash flow hedges outstanding at September 30, 2017 or October 1, 2016 .
21510_17_ITEM15_P156_S0	Changes in the fair value of currency forward contracts due to changes in time value are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness and recognized in other income (expense) as incurred.
21510_17_ITEM15_P157_S0	We classify the cash flows from the foreign exchange forward contracts that are accounted for as cash flow hedges in the same section as the underlying item, primarily within cash flows from operating activities since we do not designate our cash flow hedges as investing or financing activities.
21510_17_ITEM15_P157_S1	In fiscal 2014, we had entered into certain derivative forward contracts to sell Japanese Yen and buy Euro to hedge revenue exposures related to our photonics-based solutions in Asia.
21510_17_ITEM15_P157_S2	In order to facilitate the hedge, we transacted with counterparties in the U.S. directly and then allocated the hedge contracts to our affiliates through a back-to-back relationship with our German subsidiary.
21510_17_ITEM15_P157_S3	The German subsidiary designated these hedge contracts as cash flow hedges under ASC 815.
21510_17_ITEM15_P157_S4	The hedges were settled in fiscal 2016.
21510_17_ITEM15_P157_S5	During fiscal 2017, we did not have any activities related to designated cash flow hedges.
21510_17_ITEM15_P157_S6	During fiscal 2016, we recorded losses in OCI and in other income (expense) and reclassified losses from OCI into revenue related to the accounting for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges.
21510_17_ITEM15_P157_S7	These losses and reclassifications were not material.
21510_17_ITEM15_P157_S8	In fiscal 2015, we recorded a gain of $0.6 million in OCI and a $0.1 million loss in other income (expense) as well as reclassified $0.2 million of gains from OCI into revenue and $1.7 million of losses into cost of sales related to the accounting for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges.
21510_17_ITEM15_P157_S9	During the fiscal year ended October 1, 2016 , we recognized a loss of less than $0.1 million in other income (expense) as ineffectiveness related to a portion of an anticipated hedged transaction that failed to occur within the original hedge period plus two months.
21510_17_ITEM15_P157_S10	The remainder of the hedged transaction occurred as expected and effective amounts were recognized in revenue or cost of sales.
21510_17_ITEM15_P157_S11	The amounts that will be reclassified from OCI to earnings are generally offset by the recognition of the hedged transactions (e.g., anticipated cost of sales) in earnings, thereby achieving the realization of prices contemplated by the underlying risk management strategies, and will vary from the expected amounts presented above as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates.
21510_17_ITEM15_P158_S0	Master Netting Arrangements To mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions, we enter into master netting arrangements that allow each counterparty in the arrangements to net settle amounts of multiple and separate derivative transactions under certain conditions.
21510_17_ITEM15_P158_S1	We present the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities within the our consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis even when derivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation.
21510_17_ITEM15_P158_S2	The impact of netting derivative assets and liabilities is not material to our financial position for any of the periods presented.
21510_17_ITEM15_P158_S3	Our derivative contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features and do not require collateral or other security to be furnished by us or the counterparties.
21510_17_ITEM15_P159_S0	GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have occurred, and we write down these assets when impaired.
21510_17_ITEM15_P159_S1	We perform our annual impairment tests during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter, with any resulting impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.

21510_17_ITEM15_P161_S0	As a result of the acquisition of Rofin in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we reorganized our prior two reporting segments (Specialty Laser Systems and Commercial Lasers and Components) into two new reporting segments for the combined company: OEM Laser Sources ( OLS ) and Industrial Lasers Systems ( ILS ).
21510_17_ITEM15_P161_S1	This segment reorganization was based upon the organizational structure of the combined company and how the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") receives and utilizes information provided to allocate resources and make decisions.
21510_17_ITEM15_P162_S0	In our fiscal 2017 annual testing, we performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill for our OLS reporting unit during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount.
21510_17_ITEM15_P162_S1	In assessing the qualitative factors, we considered the impact of these key factors: macroeconomic conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency, market and industry conditions, our operating and competitive environment, regulatory and political developments, the overall financial performance of the reporting unit including cost factors and budgeted-to-actual revenue results.
21510_17_ITEM15_P162_S2	We also considered our market capitalization, stock price performance and the significant excess between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the OLS reporting unit.
21510_17_ITEM15_P162_S3	Based on our assessment, goodwill in the OLS reporting unit was not impaired as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.
21510_17_ITEM15_P162_S4	As such, it was not necessary to perform the goodwill impairment test at that time.
21510_17_ITEM15_P162_S5	For the ILS reporting unit, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the goodwill impairment test.
21510_17_ITEM15_P162_S6	We performed our test using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and noted no impairment.
21510_17_ITEM15_P162_S7	We determined the fair value of the ILS reporting unit for the test using a 50-50% weighting of the Income (discounted cash flow) approach and Market (market comparable) approach.
21510_17_ITEM15_P162_S8	Management completed and reviewed the results of the impairment analysis and concluded that an impairment charge was not required as the estimated fair value of the ILS reporting unit was significantly in excess of its carrying value.
21510_17_ITEM15_P162_S9	Between the completion of that testing and the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we noted no indications of impairment or triggering events with either reporting unit to cause us to review goodwill for potential impairment.
21510_17_ITEM15_P163_S0	The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment for fiscal 2017 and 2016 are as follows (in thousands):
21510_17_ITEM15_P164_S0	(1) Gross amount of goodwill for our ILS segment was $328.5 million at September 30, 2017 and $17.4 million at October 1, 2016 , respectively.
21510_17_ITEM15_P164_S1	At both September 30, 2017 and October 1, 2016 , the accumulated impairment loss for the ILS reporting unit was $13.0 million reflecting an impairment charge in fiscal 2009.
21510_17_ITEM15_P164_S2	(2) Gross amount of goodwill for our OLS segment was $110.9 million and $105.7 million at September 30, 2017 and October 1, 2016 , respectively.
21510_17_ITEM15_P164_S3	At both September 30, 2017 and October 1, 2016 , the accumulated impairment loss for the OLS reporting unit was $8.7 million reflecting impairment charges in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2009.
21510_17_ITEM15_P165_S0	We evaluate long-lived assets and amortizable intangible assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances or our planned use of assets indicate that their carrying amounts may not be fully recoverable or that their useful lives are no longer appropriate.
21510_17_ITEM15_P165_S1	Reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying values of assets are impaired based on comparison to the undiscounted expected future cash flows identifiable to such long-lived and amortizable intangible assets.
21510_17_ITEM15_P165_S2	If the comparison indicates that impairment exists, the impaired asset is written down to its fair value.
21510_17_ITEM15_P165_S3	In fiscal 2016 , we did not have any impairment of intangible assets as a result of the impairment analysis.

21510_17_ITEM15_P210_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 12.
21510_17_ITEM15_P211_S0	Historically option grants to employees vested over the four years from the original grant date.
21510_17_ITEM15_P211_S1	Since adoption of the 2011 Plan, no stock options have been granted to employees.
21510_17_ITEM15_P211_S2	Some vested options made to one non-employee director under a prior stock plan remain outstanding.
21510_17_ITEM15_P211_S3	Non-employee directors are automatically granted time-based restricted stock units upon first joining the Board of Directors and then upon reelection.
21510_17_ITEM15_P211_S4	New non-employee directors initially receive an award of restricted stock units valued at approximately $225,000 which vest over a two year period.
21510_17_ITEM15_P211_S5	The annual grant for non-employee directors is a value of approximately $225,000 in shares of restricted stock units that vest on February 15 of the calendar year following the grant.
21510_17_ITEM15_P211_S6	Restricted stock awards and restricted stock units are typically subject to vesting restrictions either time-based or market-based conditions for vesting.
21510_17_ITEM15_P211_S7	Until restricted stock vests, shares (including those issuable upon vesting of the applicable restricted stock unit) are subject to forfeiture if employment or service to the Company terminates prior to the release of restrictions and cannot be transferred.
21510_17_ITEM15_P212_S0	The service based restricted stock awards generally vest within three years from the date of grant.
21510_17_ITEM15_P213_S0	The service based restricted stock unit awards are generally subject to annual vesting over three years from the date of grant.
21510_17_ITEM15_P214_S0	The performance restricted stock unit award grants are generally either subject to annual vesting over three years from the date of grant or subject to a single vest measurement three years from the date of grant, depending upon achievement of performance measurements based on the performance of the Company's total shareholder returns (as defined in the plan) compared with the performance of the Russell 1000 Index.
21510_17_ITEM15_P215_S0	We recognize compensation expense for all share-based payment awards based on the fair value of such awards.
21510_17_ITEM15_P215_S1	The expense is recognized on a straight-line basis per tranche over the respective requisite service period of the awards.
21510_17_ITEM15_P216_S0	Determining Fair Value Employee Stock Purchase Plan Valuation and amortization method We estimate the fair value of employee stock purchase shares using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing formula.
21510_17_ITEM15_P216_S1	This fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the purchase period.
21510_17_ITEM15_P217_S0	The expected term represents the period of our employee stock purchase plan.
21510_17_ITEM15_P217_S1	Our process for computing expected volatility considers both historical volatility and market-based implied volatility; however our estimate of expected forfeitures is based on historical employee data and could differ from actual forfeitures.
21510_17_ITEM15_P218_S0	The risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation method is based on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term.
21510_17_ITEM15_P219_S0	The fair values of shares purchased under the employee stock purchase plan for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 were estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:
21510_17_ITEM15_P220_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 12.
21510_17_ITEM15_P221_S0	Time-based restricted stock units are fair valued at the closing market price on the date of grant.
21510_17_ITEM15_P222_S0	Performance Restricted Stock Units We grant performance restricted stock units to officers and certain employees.
21510_17_ITEM15_P222_S1	The performance stock unit agreements provide for the award of performance stock units with each unit representing the right to receive one share of our common stock to be issued after the applicable award vesting period.
21510_17_ITEM15_P222_S2	The final number of units awarded, if any, for these performance grants will be determined as of the vesting dates, based upon our total shareholder return over the performance period compared to the Russell 1000 Index and could range from no units to a maximum of twice the initial award units.
21510_17_ITEM15_P222_S3	The weighted average fair value for these performance units was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model incorporating the following weighted average assumptions:
21510_17_ITEM15_P223_S0	We recognize the estimated cost of these awards, as determined under the simulation model, over the related service period of approximately 3 years, with no adjustment in future periods based upon the actual shareholder return over the performance period.
21510_17_ITEM15_P223_S1	The following table shows total stock-based compensation expense and related tax benefits included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):
21510_17_ITEM15_P224_S0	As a result of our acquisition of Rofin on November 7, 2016, we made a payment of $15.3 million due to the cancellation of options held by employees of Rofin.
21510_17_ITEM15_P224_S1	The payment was allocated between total estimated merger consideration of $11.1 million and post-merger stock-based compensation expense of $4.2 million , based on the portion of the total service period of the underlying options that have not been completed by the merger date.
21510_17_ITEM15_P224_S2	Total stock-based compensation cost capitalized as part of inventory during fiscal 2017 was $3.6 million ; $3.3 million was amortized into income during fiscal 2017 , which includes amounts capitalized in fiscal 2017 and amounts carried over from fiscal 2016 .
21510_17_ITEM15_P224_S3	Total stock-based compensation cost capitalized as part of inventory during fiscal 2016 was $2.7 million ; $2.6 million was amortized into income during fiscal 2016 , which includes amounts capitalized in fiscal 2016 and amounts carried over from fiscal 2015 .
21510_17_ITEM15_P224_S4	At fiscal 2017 year-end, the total compensation cost related to unvested stock-based awards granted to employees under our stock plans but not yet recognized was approximately $31.7 million .
21510_17_ITEM15_P224_S5	This cost will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.5 years.
21510_17_ITEM15_P224_S6	The stock option exercise tax benefits are reported in the statement of cash flows.
21510_17_ITEM15_P224_S7	The tax benefits result from tax deductions in excess of the stock-based compensation cost recognized and are determined on a grant-by-grant basis.
21510_17_ITEM15_P224_S8	During fiscal 2017 , we recorded approximately $1.6 million of excess tax benefits as cash flows from financing activities.
21510_17_ITEM15_P224_S9	In fiscal 2016 and 2015 , we did not generate any excess tax benefits as cash flows from financing activities.

21510_17_ITEM15_P228_S0	Restricted Stock Units are converted into the right to receive common stock upon vesting; prior to issuance, the Company permits the employee holders to satisfy their tax withholding requirements by net settlement, whereby the Company withholds a portion of the shares to cover the applicable taxes based on the fair market value of the Company's stock at the vesting date.
21510_17_ITEM15_P228_S1	The number of shares withheld to cover tax payments was 131,000 in fiscal 2017 , 89,000 in fiscal 2016 and 91,000 in fiscal 2015 ; tax payments made were $15.7 million , $5.4 million and $5.3 million , respectively.
21510_17_ITEM15_P229_S0	DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS As a result of the Rofin acquisition, we have assumed all assets and liabilities of Rofin s defined benefit plans for the Rofin-Sinar Laser, GmbH ("RSL") and Rofin-Sinar Inc. ("RS Inc.") employees.
21510_17_ITEM15_P230_S0	The U.S. plan began in fiscal year 1995 and is partially funded.
21510_17_ITEM15_P230_S1	Any new employees hired after January 1, 2007, are not eligible for the RS Inc. pension plan.
21510_17_ITEM15_P231_S0	As is the customary practice with German companies, the German pension plan is unfunded.
21510_17_ITEM15_P231_S1	Any new employees hired after 2000 are not eligible for the RSL pension plan.
21510_17_ITEM15_P231_S2	The measurement date of these pension plans is September 30.
21510_17_ITEM15_P231_S3	For these pension plans, actuarial gains and losses are deferred into OCI and amortized over future periods.
21510_17_ITEM15_P232_S0	Effective January 1, 2012, the RS Inc. defined benefit plan was amended to exclude highly compensated employees, as defined by the Internal Revenue Service, from receiving future years of service under the RS Inc. defined benefit plan.
21510_17_ITEM15_P232_S1	A non-qualified defined benefit plan was created to replace the benefits lost by the employees that were otherwise excluded from the qualified defined benefit plan.
21510_17_ITEM15_P233_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 13.
21510_17_ITEM15_P234_S0	In addition, we have defined benefit plans in South Korea, Japan, Spain and Italy, covering all full-time employees with at least one year of service, and a defined benefit plan in Germany covering two individuals.
21510_17_ITEM15_P234_S1	As is the customary practice with European and Asian companies, the plans are unfunded.
21510_17_ITEM15_P234_S2	We have elected to recognize all actuarial gains and losses on these plans immediately, as incurred.
21510_17_ITEM15_P234_S3	The measurement date of these defined benefit plans is September 30.
21510_17_ITEM15_P235_S0	For financial reporting purposes, the calculation of net periodic pension costs is based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations, an assumed rate of return on pension assets and an assumed rate of compensation increase for employees covered by the plan.
21510_17_ITEM15_P235_S1	All of these assumptions were based upon management's judgment, considering all known trends and uncertainties.
21510_17_ITEM15_P235_S2	Actual results that differ from these assumptions would impact future expense recognition and the cash funding requirements of our defined benefit plans.
21510_17_ITEM15_P236_S0	Components of net periodic cost are as follows for the years ended September 30, 2017 and October 1, 2016 (in thousands):

21510_17_ITEM15_P241_S0	The weighted-average rates used to determine the net periodic benefit costs are as follows:
21510_17_ITEM15_P242_S0	We recognize the over (under) funded status of the defined benefit plans in our consolidated balance sheets.
21510_17_ITEM15_P242_S1	We also recognize, in other comprehensive income (loss), certain gains and losses that arise for the period but are deferred under current pension accounting rules.
21510_17_ITEM15_P243_S0	A one percent change in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would not have a material impact on the projected benefit obligation or the net periodic benefit cost.
21510_17_ITEM15_P244_S0	Expected benefit payments for each of the next five fiscal years and the five years aggregated thereafter is as follows (in thousands):

21510_17_ITEM15_P247_S0	We employ a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equity, debt securities and government securities are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk.
21510_17_ITEM15_P247_S1	The intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses by maximizing investment returns within that prudent level of risk.
21510_17_ITEM15_P247_S2	Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks as well as growth, value and small and large capitalizations.
21510_17_ITEM15_P247_S3	Additionally, cash balances are maintained at levels adequate to meet near-term plan expenses and benefit payments.
21510_17_ITEM15_P247_S4	Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through semi-annual investment portfolio reviews.
21510_17_ITEM15_P247_S5	Investments in our defined benefit plan are stated at fair value.
21510_17_ITEM15_P248_S0	Level 1 assets are valued using quoted market prices that represent the asset value of the shares held by the trusts.
21510_17_ITEM15_P248_S1	The level 2 assets are investments in pooled funds, which are valued using a model to reflect the valuation of their underlying assets that are publicly traded with observable values.
21510_17_ITEM15_P248_S2	The fair value of level 3 pension plan assets are measured by compiling the portfolio holdings and independently valuing the securities in those portfolios.
21510_17_ITEM15_P248_S3	The fair values of our pension plan assets, by level within the fair value hierarchy, at September 30, 2017 are as follows:

21510_17_ITEM15_P256_S1	These amounts are partially offset by Rofin transaction costs not deductible for tax purposes, tax costs of Rofin restructuring, ASC 740-10 (formerly FIN48) tax liabilities for transfer pricing, stock-based compensation not deductible for tax purposes and limitations on the deductibility of compensation under IRC Section 162(m).
21510_17_ITEM15_P257_S0	In October 2016, Coherent Singapore received an amended Pioneer Status tax exemption from the Singapore authorities effective from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2021.
21510_17_ITEM15_P257_S1	The tax holiday continues to be conditional upon our meeting certain revenue, business spending and employment thresholds.
21510_17_ITEM15_P257_S2	The impact of this tax exemption decreased Singapore income taxes by approximately $1.1 million and $0.7 million in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively.
21510_17_ITEM15_P257_S3	There is no tax benefit for fiscal 2015 due to the utilization of net operating loss.
21510_17_ITEM15_P258_S0	The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in thousands):
21510_17_ITEM15_P259_S0	In determining our fiscal 2017 and 2016 tax provisions under ASC Subtopic 740, we calculated the deferred tax assets and liabilities for each separate tax entity.
21510_17_ITEM15_P259_S1	We then considered a number of factors including the positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of our deferred tax assets to determine whether a valuation allowance should be recognized with respect to our deferred tax assets.
21510_17_ITEM15_P259_S2	We determined that a valuation allowance was appropriate for a portion of the deferred tax assets of our California and certain state research and development tax credits, foreign tax attributes and foreign net operating losses at fiscal 2017 and 2016 year-ends.
21510_17_ITEM15_P259_S3	During fiscal 2017 , we increased our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by $11.1 million to $28.7 million , primarily due to the increase in California and other states research and development tax credits and the release of R D tax reserves for California and other states, which are not expected to be recognized.
21510_17_ITEM15_P260_S0	The Company had U.S. federal deferred tax assets related to research and development credits, foreign tax credits and other tax attributes that can be used to offset federal taxable income in future periods.
21510_17_ITEM15_P260_S1	These credit carryforwards will expire if they are not used within certain time periods.
21510_17_ITEM15_P260_S2	As of September 30, 2017, management determined that there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not sufficient taxable income will exist in the future allowing us to recognize these deferred tax assets.
21510_17_ITEM15_P261_S0	The net deferred tax asset is classified on the consolidated balance sheets as follows (in thousands):

21510_17_ITEM15_P275_S0	SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION As a result of the acquisition of Rofin-Sinar Technologies Inc. ("Rofin") in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 (see discussion below), we reorganized our prior two reporting segments (Specialty Laser Systems and Commercial Lasers and Components) into two new reporting segments for the combined company: OEM Laser Sources ( OLS ) and Industrial Lasers Systems ( ILS ).
21510_17_ITEM15_P275_S1	This segment reorganization was based upon the organizational structure of the combined company and how the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") receives and utilizes information provided to allocate resources and make decisions.
21510_17_ITEM15_P275_S2	Accordingly, our segment information was restated retroactively in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
21510_17_ITEM15_P275_S3	This segmentation reflects the go-to-market strategies and synergies for our broad portfolio of laser technologies and products.
21510_17_ITEM15_P276_S0	deliver cost-effective, highly reliable photonics solutions, the OLS business segment is focused on high performance laser sources and complex optical sub-systems, typically used in microelectronics manufacturing, medical diagnostics and therapeutic medical applications, as well as in scientific research.
21510_17_ITEM15_P276_S1	Our ILS business segment delivers high performance laser sources, sub-systems and tools primarily used for industrial laser materials processing, serving important end markets like automotive, machine tool, consumer goods and medical device manufacturing.
21510_17_ITEM15_P276_S2	Rofin's operating results have been included primarily in our Industrial Lasers Systems segment.
21510_17_ITEM15_P277_S0	We have identified OLS and ILS as operating segments for which discrete financial information is available.
21510_17_ITEM15_P277_S1	Both units have dedicated engineering, manufacturing, product business management and product line management functions.
21510_17_ITEM15_P278_S0	A small portion of our outside revenue is attributable to projects and recently developed products for which a segment has not yet been determined.
21510_17_ITEM15_P279_S0	The associated direct and indirect costs are presented in the category of Corporate and other, along with other corporate costs as described below.
21510_17_ITEM15_P280_S0	Our Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the CODM as he assesses the performance of the segments and decides how to allocate resources to the segments.
21510_17_ITEM15_P281_S0	Income from operations is the measure of profit and loss that our CODM uses to assess performance and make decisions.
21510_17_ITEM15_P281_S1	As assets are not a measure used to assess the performance of the company by the CODM, asset information is not tracked or compiled by segment and is not available to be reported in our disclosures.
21510_17_ITEM15_P282_S0	Income from operations represents the net sales less the cost of sales and direct operating expenses incurred within the operating segments as well as allocated expenses such as shared sales and manufacturing costs.
21510_17_ITEM15_P282_S1	We do not allocate to our operating segments certain operating expenses which we manage separately at the corporate level.
21510_17_ITEM15_P282_S2	These unallocated costs include stock-based compensation and corporate functions (certain research and development, management, finance, legal and human resources) and are included in the results below under Corporate and other in the reconciliation of operating results.
21510_17_ITEM15_P282_S3	Management does not consider unallocated Corporate and other costs in its measurement of segment performance.
21510_17_ITEM15_P283_S0	The following table provides net sales and income from continuing operations for our operating segments and a reconciliation of our total income from continuing operations to income from continuing operations before income taxes (in thousands):

21510_17_ITEM15_P289_S0	In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we began the implementation of planned restructuring activities in connection with the acquisition of Rofin.
21510_17_ITEM15_P289_S1	These activities in fiscal 2017 primarily relate to exiting our legacy high power fiber laser product line, change of control payments to Rofin officers, the exiting of two product lines acquired in the acquisition of Rofin, realignment of our supply chain due to segment reorganization and consolidation of sales and distribution offices.
21510_17_ITEM15_P289_S2	These activities resulted in charges primarily for employee termination, other exit related costs associated with the write-off of property and equipment and inventory and early lease termination costs.
21510_17_ITEM15_P289_S3	The following table presents our current liability as accrued on our balance sheets for restructuring charges.

21510_17_ITEM15_P291_S4	Restructuring charges are recorded in cost of sales, research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations.
21510_17_ITEM15_P292_S0	DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations are comprised of Rofin s low power CO 2 laser business based in Hull, United Kingdom (the "Hull Business"), that we acquired as part of our acquisition of Rofin.
21510_17_ITEM15_P292_S1	As a condition of the acquisition, we were required to divest and hold separate the Hull Business and will report this business separately as a discontinued operation until it is divested.
21510_17_ITEM15_P292_S2	In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we entered into an agreement with a potential purchaser of the Hull Business and submitted our proposed purchaser to the European Commission for its review and approval, including the terms under which the purchase and operation of the Hull Business will occur.
21510_17_ITEM15_P292_S3	We completed the divestiture of the Hull Business on October 11, 2017, after receiving approval for the terms of the sale from the European Commission.

21510_17_ITEM15_P295_S0	In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, management decided to sell several entities that we acquired in the Rofin acquisition.
21510_17_ITEM15_P295_S1	Although the sale was not completed as of the end of fiscal 2017, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $2.9 million to operating expense in our results of operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 to reduce our carrying value in these entities to fair value.
21510_17_ITEM15_P295_S2	Current assets and current liabilities classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2017 related to continuing operations are as follows (in thousands):

21510_17_ITEM15_P298_S0	The Company hereby grants to the Employee an award of Restricted Stock Units ( RSUs ), as set forth in the Notice of Grant, subject to the terms and conditions in this Agreement and in the Company s 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan ).
21510_17_ITEM15_P298_S1	Initially capitalized terms herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Plan or as defined herein, as applicable.
21510_17_ITEM15_P299_S0	Each RSU represents the right to receive a Share on the vesting date.
21510_17_ITEM15_P299_S1	Unless and until the RSUs vest, the Employee will have no right to receive Shares under such RSUs.
21510_17_ITEM15_P299_S2	Prior to actual distribution of Shares pursuant to any vested RSUs, such RSUs will represent an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable (if at all) only from the general assets of the Company.
21510_17_ITEM15_P300_S0	Vesting Schedule; Assumption or Substitution Calculation .
21510_17_ITEM15_P300_S1	The RSUs shall vest as follows:
21510_17_ITEM15_P301_S0	Up to the Maximum Amount will vest and be settled, based upon the extent, if any, to which the performance metric has been achieved.
21510_17_ITEM15_P302_S0	The performance metric is the relative performance of Company stock against the Russell 1000 (^RUI) Index (the Russell 1000 Index ) over a three-year period, with the target Company stock performance equivalent to the performance of the Russell 1000 Index over such period.
21510_17_ITEM15_P302_S1	To determine relative performance, the baseline metrics are the 90 trading day average closing price of the Company and the Russell 1000 Index, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, or such other reliable source as is determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion, with the last of the 90 trading days falling on November 3, 2017.
21510_17_ITEM15_P302_S2	This 90 day average establishes both the Company baseline stock price (the Company Baseline Stock Price ) and the Russell 1000 Index baseline (the Russell 1000 Baseline ) against which future Company stock and Russell 1000 Index performance will be compared.
21510_17_ITEM15_P303_S0	Next, the Company will measure the 90 trading day average closing price of the Company and the Russell 1000 Index, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, or such other reliable source as is determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion, with the last trading day of such 90-trading day period ending on November 3, 2020 (establishing both the Company Closing Price and the Russell 1000 Index Closing Price ).
21510_17_ITEM15_P304_S0	The Company will then measure Company performance by dividing the Company Closing Price by the Company Baseline Stock Price, with the quotient expressed as a percentage of the Company Baseline Stock Price (the Company Percentage Performance ).
21510_17_ITEM15_P304_S1	The Company will then measure Russell 1000 Index Performance over the same period by dividing the Russell 1000 Index Closing Price by the Russell 1000 Index Baseline with the quotient expressed as a percentage of the Russell 1000 Index Baseline (the Russell 1000 Index Percentage Performance ).
21510_17_ITEM15_P305_S0	The Company will then subtract the Russell 1000 Index Percentage Performance from the Company Percentage Performance, then add 100 to the result, with the final result constituting the relative Company performance as a percentage (the Relative Performance Percentage ).
21510_17_ITEM15_P306_S0	For example, if the Relative Performance Percentage is 75% or less, no RSUs shall vest.
21510_17_ITEM15_P306_S1	If the Relative Performance Percentage equals 76%, then 4% of the Target Amount shall vest.
21510_17_ITEM15_P306_S2	If the Relative Performance Percentage equals 85%, then 40% of the Target Amount shall vest.
21510_17_ITEM15_P306_S3	If the Relative Performance Percentage equals 100%, then the Target Amount shall vest.
21510_17_ITEM15_P306_S4	If the Relative Performance Percentage equals 150% or more, then 200% of the Target Amount shall vest (i.e., the Maximum Amount shall vest).
21510_17_ITEM15_P306_S5	Relative Performance Percentages shall result in incremental vesting on a straight-line basis within tiers based on full percentage Relative Performance Percentages as set forth below:
21510_17_ITEM15_P307_S0	The Company Closing Price shall be automatically adjusted to account for any Company stock split or similar change in capitalization effected without receipt of consideration by the Company set forth in Plan Section 19(a) in the same manner as set forth in Plan Section 19(a).
21510_17_ITEM15_P307_S1	In making determinations of the number of Shares that vest hereunder, all Relative Performance Percentage fractional percentages and Share numbers below .5 shall be rounded down to the nearest whole percentage or Share number, respectively and all Relative Performance Percentage fractional percentages and Share numbers of .5 or greater shall be rounded up to the nearest whole percentage or Share number, respectively.
21510_17_ITEM15_P307_S2	All vesting and delivery of Shares hereunder, except pursuant to assumed or substituted awards in a change of control as specified in the following paragraph, shall be subject to the prior written or electronic certification of the Compensation Committee of the Board as to the extent to which the applicable performance milestones have been achieved.
21510_17_ITEM15_P308_S0	In the event the Company is acquired in a merger or asset sale pursuant to which this RSU is assumed or substituted pursuant to Plan Section 19(c) (a Change of Control ), then if the performance period has not been completed as of the date of the Change of Control, the Company Closing Price shall be deemed to be the price per share received by the Company s stockholders in the Change of Control.
21510_17_ITEM15_P308_S1	Relative performance for such uncompleted performance period shall then be measured against the Russell 1000 Index performance from the Russell 1000 Index Baseline through the 90 trading day average closing price of the Russell 1000 Index in the period ending on the date of the Change of Control.
21510_17_ITEM15_P308_S2	The Company s stock performance relative to the Russell 1000 Index shall then be determined consistently with the methodology specified herein for completed performance period.
21510_17_ITEM15_P308_S3	The number of Shares subject to this RSU so determined shall then continue to vest based upon Employee s continuing as a Service Provider to the Company, the acquirer, or their Parents or Subsidiaries through November 3, 2020, subject to accelerated vesting as set forth in the Company s Change of Control Severance Plan (but only for participants in such plan), as amended from time to time.
21510_17_ITEM15_P309_S0	Vesting = 170% of the Target Amount vesting, subject to Employee s continuing as a Service Provider through November 3, 2020 and further subject to accelerated vesting as set forth in the Company s Change of Control Severance Plan (but only for participants in such plan), as amended from time to time.
21510_17_ITEM15_P310_S0	Forfeiture upon Termination as a Service Provider .
21510_17_ITEM15_P310_S1	Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement or the Notice of Grant, if the Employee terminates service as a Service Provider for any or no reason prior to vesting, the unvested RSUs awarded by this Agreement will thereupon be forfeited at no cost to the Company, subject to accelerated vesting as set forth in the Company s Change of Control Severance Plan (but only for participants in such plan), as amended from time to time.
21510_17_ITEM15_P311_S0	Any RSUs that vest in accordance with paragraph 3 will be distributed to the Employee (or in the event of the Employee s death, to his or her estate) in Shares.
21510_17_ITEM15_P312_S0	Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph 5, no Shares shall be distributed to Employee unless and until the Employee shall have delivered to the Company or its designated Subsidiary the full amount of any federal, state or local income or other taxes which the Company or such Subsidiary may be required by law to withhold with respect to such Shares.
21510_17_ITEM15_P312_S1	The Employee may elect to satisfy any such statutory minimum tax withholding requirement by having the Company withhold Shares otherwise deliverable to the Employee or by delivering to the Company already-owned Shares, subject to the absolute discretion of the Company to disallow satisfaction of such withholding by the delivery or withholding of stock.
21510_17_ITEM15_P313_S0	deliverable hereunder unless and until certificates representing such Shares will have been issued, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Employee or Employee s broker.
21510_17_ITEM15_P314_S0	a. The Company (and not Employee s employer) is granting the RSU.
21510_17_ITEM15_P314_S1	The Company will administer the Plan from outside Employee s country of residence if the Employee s country of residence is outside the United States and United States of America law will govern all RSUs granted under the Plan.
21510_17_ITEM15_P315_S0	b. That benefits and rights provided under the Plan are wholly discretionary and, although provided by the Company, do not constitute regular or periodic payments.
21510_17_ITEM15_P316_S0	c. The benefits and rights provided under the Plan are not to be considered part of Employee s salary or compensation for purposes of calculating any severance, resignation, redundancy or other end of service payments, vacation, bonuses, long-term service awards, indemnification, pension or retirement benefits, or any other payments, benefits or rights of any kind.
21510_17_ITEM15_P317_S0	d. Employee waives any and all rights to compensation or damages as a result of the termination of employment or other service with the Company for any reason whatsoever insofar as those rights result or may result from:
21510_17_ITEM15_P318_S0	2 Employee ceasing to have any rights under, or ceasing to be entitled to any rights under the Plan as a result of such termination.
21510_17_ITEM15_P319_S0	The grant of the RSU, and any future grant of RSUs under the Plan is entirely voluntary, and at the complete discretion of the Company.
21510_17_ITEM15_P320_S0	Neither the grant of the RSU nor any future grant of an RSU by the Company will be deemed to create any obligation to grant any further RSUs, whether or not such a reservation is explicitly stated at the time of such a grant.
21510_17_ITEM15_P321_S0	The Company has the right, at any time to amend, suspend or terminate the Plan.

21510_18_ITEM1_P0_S0	Business Overview Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30.
21510_18_ITEM1_P0_S1	Fiscal years 2018 , 2017 and 2016 ended on September 29 , September 30 , and October 1 , respectively, and are referred to in this annual report as fiscal 2018 , fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 for convenience.
21510_18_ITEM1_P0_S2	Each of fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 included 52 weeks.
21510_18_ITEM1_P1_S0	We are one of the world's leading providers of lasers, laser-based technologies and laser-based system solutions in a broad range of commercial, industrial and scientific applications.
21510_18_ITEM1_P1_S1	We design, manufacture, service and market lasers and related accessories for a diverse group of customers.
21510_18_ITEM1_P1_S2	Since inception in 1966, we have grown through internal expansion and through strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies, intellectual property, manufacturing processes and product offerings.
21510_18_ITEM1_P1_S3	We are organized into two reporting segments: OEM Laser Sources ("OLS") and Industrial Lasers Systems ("ILS"), based on the organizational structure of the company and how the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") receives and utilizes information provided to allocate resources and make decisions.
21510_18_ITEM1_P1_S4	This segmentation reflects the go-to-market strategies and synergies for our broad portfolio of laser technologies and products.
21510_18_ITEM1_P1_S5	While both segments deliver cost-effective, highly reliable photonics solutions, the OLS business segment is focused on high performance laser sources and complex optical sub-systems typically used in microelectronics manufacturing, medical diagnostics and therapeutic medical applications, as well as in scientific research.
21510_18_ITEM1_P2_S0	Our ILS business segment delivers high performance laser sources, sub-systems and tools primarily used for industrial laser materials processing, serving important end markets like automotive, machine tool, consumer goods and medical device manufacturing.
21510_18_ITEM1_P3_S0	Income from continuing operations is the measure of profit and loss that our CODM uses to assess performance and make decisions.
21510_18_ITEM1_P3_S1	Income from continuing operations represents the sales less the cost of sales and direct operating expenses incurred within the operating segments as well as allocated expenses such as shared sales and manufacturing costs.
21510_18_ITEM1_P3_S2	We do not allocate to our operating segments certain operating expenses, which we manage separately at the corporate level.
21510_18_ITEM1_P3_S3	These unallocated costs include stock-based compensation and corporate functions (certain advanced research and development, management, finance, legal and human resources) and are included in Corporate and other.
21510_18_ITEM1_P3_S4	Management does not consider unallocated Corporate and other costs in its measurement of segment performance.
21510_18_ITEM1_P4_S0	We were originally incorporated in California on May 26, 1966 and reincorporated in Delaware on October 1, 1990.
21510_18_ITEM1_P4_S1	Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and we are a member of the Standard Poor's MidCap 400 Index and the Russell 1000 Index.

21510_18_ITEM1_P6_S1	On March 8, 2018, we acquired privately held O.R. Lasertechnologie GmbH and certain assets of its U.S.-based affiliate (collectively "OR Laser") for approximately $47.4 million, excluding transaction costs.
21510_18_ITEM1_P7_S0	OR Laser produces laser-based material processing equipment for a variety of uses, including additive manufacturing, welding, cladding, marking, engraving and drilling.
21510_18_ITEM1_P7_S1	See Note 3, "Business Combinations" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of this annual report.
21510_18_ITEM1_P8_S0	On February 6, 2018, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $100.0 million of our common stock from time to time through January 31, 2019.
21510_18_ITEM1_P9_S0	months ended June 30, 2018, we repurchased and retired 574,946 shares of outstanding common stock under this program at an average price of $173.91 per share for a total of $100.0 million.
21510_18_ITEM1_P9_S1	During fiscal 2018, we made payments on our senior secured term loan facility ("Euro Term Loan") of a total of 141.7 million Euros, including voluntary payments of a total of 135.0 million Euros.
21510_18_ITEM1_P10_S0	On November 7, 2016, we completed our acquisition of Rofin Sinar Technologies, Inc. ("Rofin") pursuant to the Merger Agreement dated March 16, 2016.
21510_18_ITEM1_P11_S0	Rofin was one of the world's leading developers and manufacturers of high-performance industrial laser sources and laser-based solutions and components.
21510_18_ITEM1_P11_S1	As a condition of the acquisition, we were required to divest and hold separate Rofin's low power CO 2 laser business based in Hull, United Kingdom (the "Hull Business"), and reported this business separately as a discontinued operation until its divestiture.
21510_18_ITEM1_P11_S2	We completed the divestiture of the Hull Business on October 11, 2017, after receiving approval for the terms of the sale from the European Commission.
21510_18_ITEM1_P11_S3	On April 27, 2018, we completed the sale of several entities that we acquired in our acquisition of Rofin.
21510_18_ITEM1_P12_S0	A laser emits an intense coherent beam of light with some unique and highly useful properties.
21510_18_ITEM1_P12_S1	Most importantly, a laser is orders of magnitude brighter than any lamp.
21510_18_ITEM1_P12_S2	As a result of its coherence, the beam can be focused to a very small and intense spot, useful for applications requiring very high power densities including cutting and other materials processing procedures.
21510_18_ITEM1_P12_S3	The laser's high spatial resolution is also useful for microscopic imaging and inspection applications.
21510_18_ITEM1_P13_S0	Laser light can be monochromatic all of the beam energy is confined to a narrow wavelength band.
21510_18_ITEM1_P13_S1	Some lasers can be used to create ultrafast output a series of pulses with pulse durations as short as attoseconds (10 -18 seconds).
21510_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	There are many types of lasers and one way of classifying them is by the material or medium used to create the lasing action.
21510_18_ITEM1_P14_S1	This can be in the form of a gas, liquid, semiconductor, solid state crystal or fiber.
21510_18_ITEM1_P14_S2	Lasers can also be classified by their output wavelength: ultraviolet, visible, infrared or wavelength tunable.
21510_18_ITEM1_P14_S3	We manufacture all of these laser types.
21510_18_ITEM1_P14_S4	There are also many options in terms of pulsed output versus continuous wave, pulse duration, output power, beam dimensions, etc.
21510_18_ITEM1_P14_S5	In fact, each application has its own specific requirements in terms of laser performance.
21510_18_ITEM1_P14_S6	The broad technical depth at Coherent enables us to offer a diverse set of product lines characterized by lasers targeted at growth opportunities and key applications.
21510_18_ITEM1_P14_S7	In all cases, we aim to be the supplier of choice by offering a high-value combination of superior technical performance and high reliability.
21510_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	Photonics has taken its place alongside electronics as a critical enabling technology for the twenty-first century.
21510_18_ITEM1_P15_S1	Photonics based solutions are entrenched in a broad array of industries that include microelectronics, flat panel displays, machine tool, automotive, and medical diagnostics, with adoption continuing in ever more diverse applications.
21510_18_ITEM1_P15_S2	Growth in these applications stems from two sources.
21510_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	First, there are many applications where the laser is displacing conventional technology because it can do the job faster, better or more economically (e.g. sheet metal cutting).
21510_18_ITEM1_P16_S1	Second, there are new applications where the laser is the enabling tool that makes the work possible, as in the conversion of amorphous silicon into poly crystalline silicon at low temperatures, where lasers are used in the manufacturing of high resolution flexible OLED displays found in the latest smart phones, tablets and laptop computers.
21510_18_ITEM1_P16_S2	Key laser applications include: semiconductor inspection; manufacturing of advanced printed circuit boards ("PCBs"); flat panel display manufacturing; solar cell production; medical and bio-instrumentation; materials processing; metal cutting and welding; industrial process and quality control; marking; imaging and printing; graphic arts and display; and research and development.
21510_18_ITEM1_P16_S3	For example, ultraviolet ("UV") lasers are enabling the continuous move towards miniaturization, which drives innovation and growth in many markets.
21510_18_ITEM1_P16_S4	In addition, the advent of industrial grade ultrafast lasers continues to open up new applications for laser processing.
21510_18_ITEM1_P17_S0	Coherent occupies a unique position in the industry thanks to the breadth and depth of our product and technology portfolio, which includes lasers, optics, laser beam delivery components and laser systems.
21510_18_ITEM1_P17_S1	Working closely with our customers we have developed specialized solutions that include lasers, delivery and process optics in complete assemblies (sub-systems or "rails"), and for certain applications and markets we have also developed parts handling and automation to build complete laser production systems or tools.
21510_18_ITEM1_P17_S2	We strive to develop innovative and proprietary products and solutions that meet the needs of our customers and that are based on our core expertise in lasers and optical technologies.
21510_18_ITEM1_P17_S3	In pursuit of our strategy, we intend to:
21510_18_ITEM1_P18_S0	Leverage our technology portfolio and application engineering to lead the proliferation of photonics into broader markets We will continue to identify opportunities in which our technology portfolio and application engineering can be used to offer innovative solutions and gain access to new markets.
21510_18_ITEM1_P18_S1	We plan to utilize our expertise to increase our market share in the mid to high power material processing applications.
21510_18_ITEM1_P19_S0	Streamline our manufacturing structure and improve our cost structure We will focus on optimizing the mix of products that we manufacture internally and externally.
21510_18_ITEM1_P19_S1	We will utilize vertical integration where our internal manufacturing process is considered proprietary and seek to leverage external sources when the capabilities and cost structure are well developed and on a path towards commoditization.
21510_18_ITEM1_P20_S0	Focus on long-term improvement of adjusted EBITDA, in dollars and as a percentage of net sales We define adjusted EBITDA as operating income adjusted for depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, major restructuring costs and certain other non-operating income and expense items, such as costs related to our acquisition of Rofin.
21510_18_ITEM1_P20_S1	Key initiatives for EBITDA improvements include utilization of our Asian manufacturing locations, optimizing our supply chain and continued leveraging of our infrastructure.
21510_18_ITEM1_P21_S0	Optimize our leadership position in existing markets There are a number of markets where we have historically been at the forefront of technological development and product deployment and from which we have derived a substantial portion of our revenues.
21510_18_ITEM1_P21_S1	We plan to optimize our financial returns from these markets.
21510_18_ITEM1_P22_S0	Maintain and develop additional strong collaborative customer and industry relationships We believe that the Coherent brand name and reputation for product quality, technical performance and customer satisfaction will help us to further develop our loyal customer base.
21510_18_ITEM1_P22_S1	We plan to maintain our current customer relationships and develop new ones with customers who are industry leaders and work together with these customers to design and develop innovative product systems and solutions as they develop new technologies.
21510_18_ITEM1_P23_S0	Develop and acquire new technologies and market share We will continue to enhance our market position through our existing technologies and develop new technologies through our internal research and development efforts, as well as through the acquisition of additional complementary technologies, intellectual property, manufacturing processes and product offerings.
21510_18_ITEM1_P23_S1	APPLICATIONS Our products address a broad range of applications that we group into the following markets: Microelectronics, Materials Processing, OEM Components and Instrumentation and Scientific and Government Programs.
21510_18_ITEM1_P23_S2	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentages of total net sales by market application:
21510_18_ITEM1_P24_S0	Microelectronics Nowhere is the trend towards miniaturization and higher performance more prevalent than in the Microelectronics market where smart phones, tablets, personal computers ("PC's"), televisions ("TV's") and "wearables" are driving advances in displays, integrated circuits and PCBs.
21510_18_ITEM1_P25_S0	In response to market demands and consumer expectations, semiconductor and device manufacturers are continually seeking to improve their process and design technologies in order to manufacture smaller, more powerful and more reliable devices at lower cost.
21510_18_ITEM1_P25_S1	New laser applications and new laser technologies are a key element in delivering higher resolution and higher precision at lower manufacturing cost.
21510_18_ITEM1_P26_S0	We support three major markets in the microelectronics industry: (1) flat panel display ("FPD") manufacturing, (2) advanced packaging and interconnects ("API") and (3) semiconductor front-end ("SEMI").
21510_18_ITEM1_P27_S0	Microelectronics flat panel display manufacturing The high-volume consumer market is driving the production of FPDs in applications such as mobile phones, tablets, laptop computers, TVs and wearables.
21510_18_ITEM1_P28_S0	There are several types of established and emerging displays based on quite different technologies, including liquid crystal ("LCD") and organic light emitting diodes ("OLED").
21510_18_ITEM1_P28_S1	Each of these technologies utilize laser applications in their manufacturing process to enable improved yields, higher process speed, improved battery life, lower cost and/or superior display brightness, resolution and refresh rates.
21510_18_ITEM1_P29_S0	Several display types require a high-density pattern of silicon thin film transistors ("TFTs").
21510_18_ITEM1_P29_S1	If this silicon is polycrystalline as opposed to amorphous, the display performance is greatly enhanced.
21510_18_ITEM1_P29_S2	In the past, these polysilicon layers could only be produced on expensive special glass at high temperatures.
21510_18_ITEM1_P29_S3	However, excimer-based processes, such as excimer laser annealing ("ELA") have allowed high-volume production of low-temperature polysilicon ("LTPS") on conventional glass substrates as well as flexible displays based on plastic substrates.
21510_18_ITEM1_P29_S4	Our excimer lasers provide a unique solution for LTPS because they are the only industrial-grade excimer lasers optimized for this application.
21510_18_ITEM1_P29_S5	The current state-of-the-art product for this application is our excimer Vyper laser and Linebeam systems.
21510_18_ITEM1_P29_S6	These systems deliver power ranges of 1200W to 3600W, depending on the system, enabling a critical manufacturing process step with Generation 4, 5, 5.5 and 6 substrates.
21510_18_ITEM1_P29_S7	These systems are integral to the manufacturing process on all leading LTPS-based smart phone displays, with the highest commercially available pixel densities of greater than 300 pixels per inch (ppi), with the current trends going to even higher ppi (~500 ppi) for high end smart phones, and hold the potential for deployment in tablet, laptop and OLED TV displays.
21510_18_ITEM1_P29_S8	Excimer based LTPS is also enabling flexible OLED displays which have recently undergone rapid growth as they have been adopted into smart phones.
21510_18_ITEM1_P30_S0	A modern flat panel display incorporates a number of different layers, some of which are thin films that need to be cut or structured.
21510_18_ITEM1_P30_S1	As film thicknesses decrease over time, lasers are becoming the tool of choice to process these materials.
21510_18_ITEM1_P30_S2	Our DIAMOND CO 2 and Rapid series ultrafast lasers are used for cutting FPD films.
21510_18_ITEM1_P30_S3	We have developed a proprietary technology for cutting of brittle materials such as glass and sapphire without debris and with zero kerf called SMART Cleave TM , which is used for cutting brittle materials used in displays.
21510_18_ITEM1_P30_S4	This technology uses ultrafast lasers coupled with proprietary optics.
21510_18_ITEM1_P30_S5	Our AVIA, Rapid, Monaco and DIAMOND CO 2 and CO lasers are also used in other production processes for FPDs.
21510_18_ITEM1_P30_S6	These processes include drilling, cutting, patterning, marking and yield improvement.
21510_18_ITEM1_P30_S7	Microelectronics advanced packaging and interconnects After a wafer is patterned, there are then a host of other processes, referred to as back-end processing, which finally result in a packaged encapsulated silicon chip.
21510_18_ITEM1_P30_S8	Ultimately, these chips are then assembled into finished products.
21510_18_ITEM1_P31_S0	The advent of high-speed logic and high-memory content devices has caused chip manufacturers to look for alternative technologies to improve performance and lower process costs.
21510_18_ITEM1_P31_S1	This search includes new types of materials, such as low-k and thinner silicon.
21510_18_ITEM1_P31_S2	Our AVIA, Rapid, Monaco and Matrix lasers provide economical methods of cutting and scribing these wafers while delivering higher yields than traditional mechanical methods.
21510_18_ITEM1_P31_S3	There are similar trends in chip packaging and PCB manufacturing requiring more compact packaging and denser interconnects.
21510_18_ITEM1_P32_S0	In many cases, lasers present enabling technologies.
21510_18_ITEM1_P32_S1	For instance, lasers are now the only economically practical method for drilling microvias in chip substrates and in both rigid and flexible PCBs.
21510_18_ITEM1_P32_S2	These microvias are tiny interconnects that are essential for enabling high-density circuitry commonly used in smart phones, tablets and advanced computing systems.
21510_18_ITEM1_P33_S0	Our DIAMOND CO 2 and AVIA diode pumped solid state ("DPSS") lasers are the lasers of choice in this application.
21510_18_ITEM1_P33_S1	The ability of these lasers to operate at very high repetition rates translates into faster drilling speeds and increased throughput in microvia processing applications.
21510_18_ITEM1_P33_S2	In addition, multi-layer circuit boards require more flexible production methods than conventional printing technologies can offer, which has led to widespread adoption of laser direct imaging ("LDI").
21510_18_ITEM1_P33_S3	Our Paladin laser is used for this application.
21510_18_ITEM1_P34_S0	Microelectronics semiconductor front-end The term "front-end" refers to the production of semiconductor devices which occurs prior to packaging.
21510_18_ITEM1_P34_S1	As semiconductor device geometries decrease in size, devices become increasingly susceptible to smaller defects during each phase of the manufacturing process and these defects can negatively impact yield.
21510_18_ITEM1_P35_S0	One of the semiconductor industry's responses to the increasing vulnerability of semiconductor devices to smaller defects has been to use defect detection and inspection techniques that are closely linked to the manufacturing process.
21510_18_ITEM1_P36_S0	Detecting the presence of defects is only the first step in preventing their recurrence.
21510_18_ITEM1_P36_S1	After detection, defects must be examined in order to identify their size, shape and the process step in which the defect occurred.
21510_18_ITEM1_P37_S0	Identification of the sources of defects in the lengthy and complex semiconductor manufacturing process has become essential for maintaining high yield production.
21510_18_ITEM1_P37_S1	Semiconductor manufacturing has become an around-the-clock operation and it is important for products used for inspection, measurement and testing to be reliable and to have long lifetimes.
21510_18_ITEM1_P38_S0	Our Azure, Paladin, Excimer and ion lasers are used to detect and characterize defects in semiconductor chips.
21510_18_ITEM1_P39_S0	Materials processing The materials processing segment is comprised of four major markets: (1) automotive, (2) machine tool, (3) medical device and (4) consumer goods, as well a number of smaller markets.
21510_18_ITEM1_P39_S1	It is the most diverse of all the segments we serve and a large cross section of our products are used in this segment.
21510_18_ITEM1_P39_S2	Our sales in this segment include laser sources, laser sources with beam delivery optics (laser rails), beam delivery components, laser diagnostic equipment and complete laser systems (tools).
21510_18_ITEM1_P39_S3	At a high level, the drivers for laser deployment within the materials processing segment are faster processing with higher yields, processing of new and novel materials, more environmentally friendly processes and higher precision.

21510_18_ITEM1_P41_S0	In the machine tool industry lasers have been the solution of choice for cutting metal for some time.
21510_18_ITEM1_P41_S1	Traditionally this was a market for high power CO 2 lasers, but with the advent of high power fiber lasers, a transition away from CO 2 took place in many applications.
21510_18_ITEM1_P41_S2	That transition is substantially done since fiber lasers are used in the majority of metal cutting applications.
21510_18_ITEM1_P41_S3	We serve this market with our high power fiber and CO 2 lasers.
21510_18_ITEM1_P41_S4	As a fully vertically integrated fiber and laser diode supplier, we are able to produce all key components in-house.
21510_18_ITEM1_P41_S5	We have a complete line of high power fiber lasers in power levels up to 10 kW. We offer lasers with different performance points in terms of power levels and beam profiles to address specific applications, including single mode lasers and advanced beam shaping options, e.g. the ARM advanced high power fiber laser where the beam parameters can be optimized to reach higher quality welds and translate into higher customer yields.
21510_18_ITEM1_P42_S0	Additive manufacturing or 3D printing is another growing market where lasers have seen rapid growth.
21510_18_ITEM1_P42_S1	We serve this market with laser selective laser melting (SLM) systems for 3D printing of metal parts called Laser Creator as well as CO 2 and DPSS lasers.
21510_18_ITEM1_P43_S0	The medical device market is characterized by its need for high precision manufacturing with high levels of quality control which lends itself very well to laser manufacturing.
21510_18_ITEM1_P43_S1	Applications include fine cutting and welding in addition to corrosive resistant marking.

21510_18_ITEM1_P44_S2	We also support the laser-based instrumentation market with a range of laser-related components, including diode lasers and optical fibers.
21510_18_ITEM1_P44_S3	Our OEM component business includes sales to other, less integrated laser manufacturers participating in OEM markets such as materials processing, scientific, and medical.
21510_18_ITEM1_P45_S0	Laser applications for bio-instrumentation include bio-agent detection for point source and standoff detection of pathogens or other bio-toxins; confocal microscopy for biological imaging that allows researchers and clinicians to visualize cellular and subcellular structures and processes with an incredible amount of detail; DNA sequencing where lasers provide automation and data acquisition rates that would be impossible by any other method; drug discovery genomic and proteomic analyses that enable drug discovery to proceed at very high throughput rates; and flow cytometry for analyzing single cells or populations of cells in a heterogeneous mixture, including blood samples.
21510_18_ITEM1_P45_S1	Our OBIS, Flare, Galaxy, Sapphire, BioRay and Genesis lasers are used in several bio-instrumentation applications.
21510_18_ITEM1_P45_S2	Medical Therapy We sell a variety of components and lasers to medical laser companies for use in end-user applications such as ophthalmology, aesthetic, surgical, therapeutic and dentistry.

21510_18_ITEM1_P45_S4	We have a leading position in Lasik and photorefractive keratectomy surgery methods with our ExciStar XS excimer laser platform.
21510_18_ITEM1_P45_S5	We also provide ultrafast lasers for use in cataract surgery and optical fibers for surgical applications.
21510_18_ITEM1_P45_S6	The unique ability of our optically pumped semiconductor lasers ("OPSL") technology to match a wavelength to an application has led to the development of a high-power yellow (577nm) laser for the treatment of eye related diseases, such as Age Related Macular Degeneration and retinal diseases associated with diabetes.
21510_18_ITEM1_P45_S7	The 577nm wavelength was designed to match the peak in absorption of oxygenated hemoglobin thereby allowing treatment to occur at a lower power level, and thus reducing stress and heat-load placed on the eye with traditional green-based (530nm) solid state lasers.
21510_18_ITEM1_P45_S8	Other applications where our OBIS, Genesis and Sapphire series of lasers are used include the retinal scanning market in diagnostic imaging systems as well as new ground breaking in-vivo imaging.

21510_18_ITEM1_P46_S1	These have included ultrafast lasers, DPSS lasers, continuous-wave ("CW") systems, excimer gas lasers and water-cooled ion gas lasers.
21510_18_ITEM1_P46_S2	Our portfolio of lasers that address the scientific research market is broad and includes our Chameleon, Chameleon Discovery, COMPexPro, Astrella, Revolution, Fidelity, Legend, Libra, Monaco, Vitara, Mephisto, Mira, Genesis and Verdi lasers.
21510_18_ITEM1_P46_S3	Many of the innovations and products pioneered in the scientific marketplace have become commercial successes for both our OEM customers and us.
21510_18_ITEM1_P46_S4	We have a large installed base of scientific lasers which are used in a wide range of applications spanning virtually every branch of science and engineering.
21510_18_ITEM1_P46_S5	These applications include biology and life science, engineering, physical chemistry and physics.
21510_18_ITEM1_P46_S6	Most of these applications require the use of ultrafast lasers that enable the generation of pulses short enough to be measured in femto- or attoseconds (10 -15 to 10 -18 seconds).
21510_18_ITEM1_P46_S7	Because of these very short pulse durations, ultrafast lasers enable the study of fundamental physical and chemical processes with temporal resolution unachievable with any other tool.
21510_18_ITEM1_P46_S8	These lasers also deliver very high peak power and large bandwidths, which can be used to generate many exotic effects.
21510_18_ITEM1_P46_S9	Some of these are now finding their way into mainstream applications, such as microscopy or materials processing.
21510_18_ITEM1_P46_S10	The use of ultrafast lasers such as the Chameleon, Fidelity and Monaco in microscopy is now a common occurrence in bio-imaging labs, and they have become a crucial tool in modern neuroscience research.
21510_18_ITEM1_P46_S11	FUTURE TRENDS Microelectronics Lasers are widely used in mass production microelectronics applications largely because they enable entirely new application capabilities that cannot be realized by any other known means.
21510_18_ITEM1_P46_S12	These laser-based fabrication and testing methods provide a level of precision, typically on a micrometer and nanometer level, that are unique, faster, are touch free, deliver superior end products, increase yields, and/or reduce production costs.
21510_18_ITEM1_P46_S13	We anticipate this trend to continue, driven primarily by the increasing sophistication and miniaturization of consumer electronic goods and their convergence via the internet, resulting in increasing demand for better displays, more bandwidth and memory, and all packaged into devices which are lighter, thinner and consume less power.
21510_18_ITEM1_P46_S14	Although this market follows the macro-economic trends and carries inherent risks, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to capitalize on the current market trends.
21510_18_ITEM1_P47_S0	Excimer laser based LTPS is a key technology for producing high resolution OLED displays in general and flexible OLED displays in particular.
21510_18_ITEM1_P47_S1	Demand for CO 2 , Avia, Matrix, Rapid, Monaco, Helios and direct diode lasers correlate with the need for related FPD touch panel, film cutting, light guide technology, repair and frit welding applications.
21510_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	The trend for thinner and lighter devices is impacting the glass substrates used in today's mobile devices requiring thinner glass with higher degrees of mechanical strength and scratch resistance.
21510_18_ITEM1_P48_S1	Mechanical means of cutting these glass and sapphire pieces are no longer adequate to meet future requirements and we expect lasers to play an increased role.
21510_18_ITEM1_P48_S2	Our CO, CO 2, Monaco and Rapid lasers together with our proprietary SmartCleave technology are well positioned to take advantage of this trend.
21510_18_ITEM1_P48_S3	Semiconductor devices look set to continue Moore's Law, shrinking device geometries for at least another decade, as well as expanding vertically into new 3D structures.
21510_18_ITEM1_P48_S4	As a result we believe our many UV laser sources (such as Azure, Paladin, Avia, Rapid, ExiStar and Matrix) will continue to find increasing adoption, since their unique optical properties align well with the process demands of a nanometer scale world.
21510_18_ITEM1_P48_S5	These same lasers, plus Monaco, Rapid, CO and CO 2 are also widely adopted for back end Advanced Packaging and Interconnect (API) applications.
21510_18_ITEM1_P48_S6	With dimension roadmaps showing a decade of dimension shrink on PCBs, interconnects, Silicon LED scribe widths and wafer thickness, we believe that our portfolio of lasers aligns well with these demands as well as new processes that could be enabled by our lasers, to meet the increasing demands and decreasing tolerances of these markets.
21510_18_ITEM1_P48_S7	While we anticipate investment in OLED technology to continue, we expect a softening of the demand in fiscal 2019 and a recovery from anticipated 2019 demand levels in fiscal 2020, with additional vendors supplying OLED displays for consumer products.
21510_18_ITEM1_P49_S0	Materials processing The materials processing segment is the most diverse of all the segments we serve and a large cross section of our products are used in this segment.
21510_18_ITEM1_P49_S1	We sell laser sources, laser rails, beam delivery components, laser diagnostic equipment and complete laser tools.
21510_18_ITEM1_P49_S2	There are many drivers at play, but at a high level they involve faster processing with higher yields, processing of new materials, more environmentally friendly processes and higher precision.
21510_18_ITEM1_P50_S0	The automotive industry is undergoing rapid changes that present opportunities for further use of lasers.
21510_18_ITEM1_P50_S1	Trends such as reduction in emissions from lighter cars and electric vehicles require new materials and new processes for welding, cutting and drilling.
21510_18_ITEM1_P50_S2	We believe this will lead to further adoption of lasers and tools based on high power fiber and diode lasers, as well as ultrafast and CO 2 lasers.
21510_18_ITEM1_P50_S3	For example, the trend toward lighter weight cars requires more aluminum welding, an application in which our ARM laser technology offers competitive advantages versus alternative solutions.
21510_18_ITEM1_P50_S4	We see similar opportunities for electric vehicle and battery applications.
21510_18_ITEM1_P50_S5	We expect to see continued growth for high power fiber lasers in the machine tool industry used in metal cutting applications.
21510_18_ITEM1_P50_S6	In addition, we see additional opportunities in newer applications such as laser cladding and heat treatment.
21510_18_ITEM1_P50_S7	In the consumer goods market, we serve a large variety of applications in packaging, digital printing, jewelry, textiles, security and consumer electronics.

21510_18_ITEM1_P50_S11	This market is set to continue to grow in the foreseeable future as the population becomes older and advanced medical procedures spread outside the traditional markets in US, Europe and Japan.
21510_18_ITEM1_P50_S12	In 3D printing we expect continued growth, particularly in the area of metal additive manufacturing where we supply SLM tools.
21510_18_ITEM1_P51_S0	The bio instrumentation market's most important areas: microscopy, flow cytometry and DNA sequencing, are all enjoying solid research funding on a worldwide basis with some local variations.
21510_18_ITEM1_P52_S0	In this field, our OPSL technology gives us differentiated products at a number of important wavelengths.
21510_18_ITEM1_P52_S1	This advantage coupled with strong focus on meeting our customers' demands for more compact and cost effective sources has resulted in growth for us in this market and we expect that to continue.
21510_18_ITEM1_P52_S2	Our OPSL technology resulted in the first truly continuous wave solid-state UV laser which enables the use of UV in a clinical as well as a research environment.
21510_18_ITEM1_P53_S0	In the medical therapeutic area, we see stable business with several opportunities for growth.
21510_18_ITEM1_P53_S1	We supply excimer lasers used in refractive eye surgery and are actively involved in further developments in laser vision correction including the use of ultrafast lasers in applications such as laser cataract surgery where higher precision and use of advanced implants enable better and more reliable patient outcomes.
21510_18_ITEM1_P53_S2	We also have opportunities in dental procedures for both hard and soft tissue ablation, with greatly improved patient comfort and outcome.
21510_18_ITEM1_P54_S0	since the wavelength is particularly suitable for the treatment of blood vessels.

21510_18_ITEM1_P56_S0	Scientific research and government programs Worldwide scientific funding is expected to be relatively stable, with some regions growing and others just holding their current level.
21510_18_ITEM1_P57_S0	Bright spots include the strong push in neuroscience to better understand how the brain functions.
21510_18_ITEM1_P57_S1	Lasers play a very important role in imaging brain structure as well as tracking activity in animal brains using techniques such as optogenetics.
21510_18_ITEM1_P57_S2	We believe that our current and upcoming products are well positioned to take advantage of this exciting opportunity.
21510_18_ITEM1_P57_S3	In physics and chemistry applications, our recent product introductions of high performance and industrially hardened ultrafast products have been very well received.
21510_18_ITEM1_P57_S4	While this is a very competitive market, we expect that our new products will position us for growth.
21510_18_ITEM1_P57_S5	MARKET APPLICATIONS We design, manufacture and market lasers, laser tools, precision optics and related accessories for a diverse group of customers.
21510_18_ITEM1_P58_S0	DPSS Excimer OPSL Ultrafast *Coherent sells its laser measurement and control products into a number of these applications.
21510_18_ITEM1_P59_S0	In addition to products we provide, we invest routinely in the core technologies needed to create substantial differentiation for our products in the marketplace.
21510_18_ITEM1_P59_S1	Our semiconductor, crystal, fiber and large form factor optics facilities all maintain an external customer base providing value-added solutions.

21510_18_ITEM1_P61_S0	DPSS lasers use semiconductor lasers to pump a crystal to produce a laser beam.
21510_18_ITEM1_P61_S1	By changing the energy, optical components and the types of crystals used in the laser, different wavelengths and types of laser light can be produced.
21510_18_ITEM1_P62_S0	The efficiency, reliability, longevity and relatively low cost of DPSS lasers make them ideally suited for a wide range of OEM and end-user applications, particularly those requiring 24-hour operations.
21510_18_ITEM1_P63_S0	Our DPSS systems are compact and self-contained sealed units.
21510_18_ITEM1_P63_S1	Unlike conventional tools and other lasers, our DPSS lasers require minimal maintenance since they do not have internal controls or components that require adjusting and cleaning to maintain consistency.
21510_18_ITEM1_P63_S2	They are also less affected by environmental changes in temperature and humidity, which can alter alignment and inhibit performance in many systems.
21510_18_ITEM1_P64_S0	We manufacture a variety of types of DPSS lasers for different applications including semiconductor inspection; advanced packaging and interconnects; laser pumping; spectroscopy; bio-agent detection; DNA sequencing; drug discovery; flow cytometry; forensics; computer-to-plate printing; entertainment lighting (display); medical; rapid prototyping and marking, welding, engraving, cutting and drilling.
21510_18_ITEM1_P65_S0	Fiber Lasers, Fiber Components and Fiber Assemblies Fiber lasers use semiconductor lasers to pump a doped optical fiber to produce a laser beam.
21510_18_ITEM1_P65_S1	The unique features of a fiber laser make them suitable for producing high power, continuous wave laser beams.
21510_18_ITEM1_P65_S2	Our fiber laser design has several unique features including a modular design for improved serviceability and diode bar based pumping.
21510_18_ITEM1_P65_S3	Due to packaging efficiency, diode bars reduce the overall cost of a fiber laser.
21510_18_ITEM1_P66_S0	Some of the most critical components inside a fiber laser include the gain fiber itself and the diodes providing the pump power.
21510_18_ITEM1_P66_S1	We plan to continue to drive cost reduction in our diode laser pumps and demonstrate the scalability of the platform and as a result, expect to be well positioned as a fiber laser supplier.
21510_18_ITEM1_P67_S0	This platform addresses the large growing high power metal cutting and joining market.
21510_18_ITEM1_P68_S0	We are the world's leading OEM supplier of Active Fiber for fiber lasers - selected for our combination of high performance and consistent quality.

21510_18_ITEM1_P68_S3	In addition, many of the fiber components offered in the broader market, such as Fiber Bragg Gratings and Fiber Combiners, have Coherent fiber in them.
21510_18_ITEM1_P69_S0	Gas lasers (CO, CO 2 , Excimer, Ion) The breadth of our gas laser portfolio is industry leading, encompassing CO, CO 2 , excimer and ion laser technologies.
21510_18_ITEM1_P70_S0	Gas lasers derive their name from the use of one or more gases as a lasing medium.
21510_18_ITEM1_P70_S1	They collectively span an extremely diverse and useful emission range, from the very deep ultraviolet to the far infrared.
21510_18_ITEM1_P70_S2	This diverse range of available wavelengths, coupled with high optical output power, and an abundance of other attractive characteristics, makes gas lasers extremely useful and popular for a variety of microelectronics, scientific, medical therapeutic and materials processing applications.
21510_18_ITEM1_P71_S0	Our OPSL platform is a surface emitting semiconductor laser that is energized or pumped by a semiconductor laser.
21510_18_ITEM1_P71_S1	The use of optical pumping circumvents inherent power scaling limitations of electrically pumped lasers, enabling very high powered devices.
21510_18_ITEM1_P71_S2	A wide range of wavelengths can be achieved by varying the semiconductor materials used in the device and changing the frequency of the laser beam using techniques common in solid state lasers.
21510_18_ITEM1_P71_S3	The platform leverages high reliability technologies developed for telecommunications and produces a compact, rugged, high power, single-mode laser.
21510_18_ITEM1_P71_S4	Our OPSL products are well suited to a wide range of applications, including the bio-instrumentation, medical therapeutics and graphic arts and display markets.
21510_18_ITEM1_P72_S0	Semiconductor lasers High power edge emitting semiconductor diode lasers use the same principles as widely-used CD and DVD lasers, but produce significantly higher power levels.
21510_18_ITEM1_P72_S1	The advantages of this type of laser include smaller size, longer life, enhanced reliability and greater efficiency.
21510_18_ITEM1_P73_S0	We manufacture a wide range of discrete semiconductor laser products with wavelengths ranging from 650nm to over 1000nm and output powers ranging from 1W to over 100W, with highly integrated products in the kW range.
21510_18_ITEM1_P74_S0	packaged and fiber coupled single emitters and bars, monolithic stacks and fully integrated modules with microprocessor controlled units that contain power supplies and active coolers.
21510_18_ITEM1_P75_S0	Our semiconductor lasers are used internally as the pump lasers in DPSS, fiber and OPSL products that are manufactured by us, as well as a wide variety of external medical, OEM, military and industrial applications, including aesthetic (hair removal, cosmetic dentistry), graphic arts, counter measures, rangefinders, target designators, cladding, hardening, brazing and welding.
21510_18_ITEM1_P76_S0	Lasers Ultrafast lasers are lasers generating light pulses with durations of a few femtoseconds (10 -15 seconds) to a few tens of picoseconds (10 -12 seconds).
21510_18_ITEM1_P76_S1	These types of lasers are used for medical, advanced microelectronics and materials processing applications as well as scientific research.
21510_18_ITEM1_P76_S2	UF laser oscillators generate a train of pulses at 50-100 MHz, with peak powers of tens of kilowatts, and UF laser amplifiers generate pulses at 1-2000 kHz, with peak powers up to several Terawatts.
21510_18_ITEM1_P76_S3	The extremely short duration of UF laser pulses enables temporally resolving fast events like the dynamics of atoms or electrons.
21510_18_ITEM1_P76_S4	In addition, the high peak power enables so-called non-linear effects where several photons can be absorbed by a molecule at the same time.
21510_18_ITEM1_P76_S5	This type of process enables applications like multi-photon excitation microscopy or ablation of materials with high precision and minimal thermal damage.
21510_18_ITEM1_P77_S0	The use of our ultrafast lasers in applications outside science has been growing rapidly over the last several years, particularly in microelectronics and materials processing applications.
21510_18_ITEM1_P78_S0	Integrated Laser Solutions: Rails and Tools In most cases, our lasers are integrated into machine tools or systems to perform a specific task, e.g. manufacturing of electronic components or performing a procedure on a patient.
21510_18_ITEM1_P78_S1	Inside the tool the laser is typically combined with delivery optics and beam steering devices, such as galvos, to deliver the laser beam to the workpiece.
21510_18_ITEM1_P78_S2	In addition to offering laser sources, we also offer solutions comprising beam delivery optics, mechanics and control electronics including software.
21510_18_ITEM1_P78_S3	We believe that these 'sub-systems' or 'rails' allow us to leverage our expertise in laser processing and optical design into superior solutions for our customers, with applications that can offer higher value and/or faster time to market.
21510_18_ITEM1_P78_S4	We have developed proprietary hardware, firmware and software in this area.
21510_18_ITEM1_P79_S0	Rail products often include vision systems, process monitoring and monitoring of the system itself.
21510_18_ITEM1_P79_S1	Our rail products include: PowerLine series for marking; the StarFiber for welding and cutting; the PWS welding system; the QFS laser scribing system; and the PerfoLas and StarShape CO 2 laser based systems.
21510_18_ITEM1_P79_S2	In select cases we also offer complete laser systems or 'tools' which include the laser rail as well as a material handling system inside a class 1 laser safety housing, ready to be used in production or development environments.
21510_18_ITEM1_P79_S3	Our laser tools products include: the Laser Creator 3D metal printing system; the Performance, Select and Integral series of manual welding systems; the Exact and MPS series of modular and highly configurable laser processing systems; the EasyMark, EasyJewel, LabelMarker Advanced and Combiline laser marking systems; the META laser cutting tools; and the PWS mini welding system.

21510_18_ITEM1_P81_S2	The length of warranties offered on our products and services varies, but primarily ranges from 12 to 24 months.
21510_18_ITEM1_P81_S3	Warranty reserves, as reflected on our consolidated balance sheets, have generally been sufficient to cover product warranty repair and replacement costs.
21510_18_ITEM1_P81_S4	The weighted average warranty period covered in our reserve is approximately 15 months.
21510_18_ITEM1_P82_S0	MANUFACTURING Since the acquisition of Rofin in November 2016, we have integrated Rofin into our organizational structure and both organizations are operating as one company with common objectives, goals and processes.
21510_18_ITEM1_P82_S1	Strategies are being implemented to improve operating leverage, to execute synergies and to enhance our customers' experience.
21510_18_ITEM1_P82_S2	Common policies and guidelines have been communicated, key management and operating processes have been implemented and ERP systems at all of Rofin's sites in Asia and North America, and certain sites in Europe, have been integrated onto our Oracle ERP and Agile planning platforms, consistent with the rest of Coherent.
21510_18_ITEM1_P82_S3	This integration process will continue into fiscal 2019.
21510_18_ITEM1_P83_S0	Strategies One of our core manufacturing strategies is to tightly control our supply of key parts, components, sub-assemblies and outsourcing partners.
21510_18_ITEM1_P83_S1	We primarily utilize vertical integration when we have proprietary internal capabilities that are not cost-effectively available from external sources.
21510_18_ITEM1_P83_S2	We believe this is essential to maintaining high quality products and enable rapid development and deployment of new products and technologies.
21510_18_ITEM1_P83_S3	We provide customers with products manufactured at the highest level of quality, leveraging Coherent's quality processes that are International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") certified at our principal manufacturing sites.
21510_18_ITEM1_P83_S4	Committed to quality and customer satisfaction, we design and produce many of our own components and sub-assemblies in order to retain quality and performance control.
21510_18_ITEM1_P83_S5	We have also outsourced certain components, sub-assemblies and finished goods where we can maintain our high quality standards while improving our cost structure.
21510_18_ITEM1_P83_S6	As part of our strategy to increase our market share and customer support in Asia as well as our continuing efforts to manage costs, we have transferred the production of additional products into both of our Singapore and Malaysia factories.
21510_18_ITEM1_P83_S7	With the acquisition of Rofin, we now have a manufacturing footprint in Nanjing, China.
21510_18_ITEM1_P83_S8	We are transferring additional products and volume to Nanjing as well as consolidating our China repair activities in that facility.
21510_18_ITEM1_P83_S9	We have significantly increased our tube refurbishment capacity and footprint in our South Korea operations, which has allowed us to reduce service response time and inventories, providing benefits to us and to our customers.
21510_18_ITEM1_P83_S10	We have also increased our sourcing of materials from Asia through our International Procurement Office in Singapore, which has enabled us to reduce material costs on a global basis.
21510_18_ITEM1_P84_S0	We have designed and implemented proprietary manufacturing tools, equipment and techniques in an effort to provide products that differentiate us from our competitors.
21510_18_ITEM1_P84_S1	These proprietary manufacturing techniques are utilized in a number of our product lines including our gas laser production, crystal growth, beam alignment as well as the wafer growth for our semiconductor, optically pumped semiconductor laser product family and fiber component and fiber laser product family.
21510_18_ITEM1_P85_S0	Raw materials or sub-components required in the manufacturing process are generally available from several sources.

21510_18_ITEM1_P87_S2	Substantially all of our legacy Rofin facilities are either ISO 9001 certified or are in the process of being certified.
21510_18_ITEM1_P87_S3	We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights.
21510_18_ITEM1_P87_S4	As of September 29, 2018 , we held approximately 725 U.S. and foreign patents, which expire in calendar years 2018 through 2037 (depending on the payment of maintenance fees) and we have approximately 245 additional pending patent applications that have been filed.
21510_18_ITEM1_P87_S5	The issued patents cover various products in all of the major markets that we serve.
21510_18_ITEM1_P87_S6	Some of our products are designed to include intellectual property licensed from third parties.
21510_18_ITEM1_P87_S7	It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to aspects of our products, processes and services.
21510_18_ITEM1_P87_S8	While we have generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained on reasonable terms in the future or at all.
21510_18_ITEM1_P87_S9	For a discussion of the importance to our business of, and the risks attendant to intellectual property rights, see "Risk Factors" in Item 1A "If we are unable to protect our proprietary technology, our competitive advantage could be harmed" and "We may, in the future, be subject to claims or litigation from third parties, for claims of infringement of their proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of competitors or other rights holders.
21510_18_ITEM1_P87_S10	These claims could result in costly litigation and the diversion of our technical and management personnel.
21510_18_ITEM1_P88_S0	COMPETITION Competition in the various photonics markets in which we provide products is very intense.
21510_18_ITEM1_P88_S1	We compete against a number of large public and private companies including IPG Photonics Corporation, Lumentum Holdings Inc., MKS Instruments, Inc., Novanta Inc., nLIGHT, Inc. and TRUMPF GmbH, as well as other smaller companies.
21510_18_ITEM1_P88_S2	In addition, from time to time our customers may also decide to vertically integrate and build their own photonics products.
21510_18_ITEM1_P89_S0	Other considerations by our customers include warranty, global service and support and distribution.
21510_18_ITEM1_P89_S1	At fiscal 2018 year-end, our backlog of orders scheduled for shipment (within one year) was $759.9 million compared to $1,040.0 million at fiscal 2017 year-end.
21510_18_ITEM1_P89_S2	By segment, backlog for OLS was $488.8 million and $801.4 million , respectively, at fiscal 2018 and 2017 year-ends.
21510_18_ITEM1_P89_S3	Backlog for ILS was $271.1 million and $238.6 million , respectively, at fiscal 2018 and 2017 year-ends.
21510_18_ITEM1_P89_S4	The decrease in OLS backlog from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 year-end was primarily due to the timing of large excimer laser annealing system shipments, net of orders, for the flat panel display market.
21510_18_ITEM1_P89_S5	The increase in ILS backlog from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 year-end was primarily from orders in the materials processing and high power fiber laser markets.
21510_18_ITEM1_P89_S6	Orders used to compute backlog are generally cancellable and, depending on the notice period, are subject to rescheduling by our customers.
21510_18_ITEM1_P89_S7	We have not historically experienced a significant rate of cancellation or rescheduling, however the rate of cancellations or rescheduling may increase in the future.
21510_18_ITEM1_P90_S0	Subsequent to year-end, one customer indicated its intent to cancel three purchase orders which included orders shippable within 12 months of $38.2 million and were included in backlog as of fiscal 2018 year-end.
21510_18_ITEM1_P90_S1	We reached agreement with this customer for compensation for such cancellation.
21510_18_ITEM1_P91_S0	We have historically generally experienced decreased revenue in the first fiscal quarter compared to other quarters in our fiscal year due to the impact of time off and business closures at our facilities and those of many of our customers due to year-end holidays.
21510_18_ITEM1_P91_S1	For example over the past 10 years, excluding certain recovery years, our first fiscal quarter revenues have ranged 2%-12% below the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal years.
21510_18_ITEM1_P91_S2	This historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's future net sales or financial performance.
21510_18_ITEM1_P92_S0	As of fiscal 2018 year-end, we had 5,418 employees.
21510_18_ITEM1_P92_S1	Approximately 694 of our employees are involved in research and development; 3,496 of our employees are involved in operations, manufacturing, service and quality assurance; and 1,228 of our employees are involved in sales, order administration, marketing, finance, information technology, general management and other administrative functions.
21510_18_ITEM1_P92_S2	Our success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain employees.
21510_18_ITEM1_P92_S3	We face competition in this regard from other companies, research and academic institutions, government entities and other organizations.
21510_18_ITEM1_P92_S4	We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
21510_18_ITEM1_P93_S0	ACQUISITIONS On March 8, 2018, we acquired privately held OR Laser for approximately $47.4 million, excluding transaction costs.

21510_18_ITEM1_P95_S0	In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we began the implementation of planned restructuring activities in connection with the acquisition of Rofin.
21510_18_ITEM1_P95_S1	These activities to date primarily have related to exiting our legacy high power fiber laser product line, change of control payments to Rofin officers, the exiting of two product lines acquired in the acquisition of Rofin, realignment of our supply chain due to segment reorganization and consolidation of sales and distribution offices as well as certain manufacturing sites.
21510_18_ITEM1_P95_S2	These activities resulted in charges primarily for employee termination, other exit related costs associated with the write-off of property and equipment and inventory and early lease termination costs.
21510_18_ITEM1_P95_S3	The fiscal 2018 severance related costs are primarily comprised of severance pay for employees being terminated due to the consolidation of certain manufacturing sites.
21510_18_ITEM1_P95_S4	The fiscal 2018 asset write-offs are primarily comprised of inventory and equipment write-offs due to the consolidation of certain manufacturing sites.
21510_18_ITEM1_P95_S5	We plan to continue additional restructuring activities in fiscal 2019 related to our acquisition of Rofin.
21510_18_ITEM1_P96_S0	Environmental regulation Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, handling and disposal of regulated materials, chemicals, various radioactive materials and certain waste products.
21510_18_ITEM1_P96_S1	In the United States, we are subject to the federal regulation and control of the Environmental Protection Agency.
21510_18_ITEM1_P96_S2	Comparable authorities are involved in other countries.
21510_18_ITEM1_P96_S3	Such rules are subject to change by the governing agency and we monitor those changes closely.
21510_18_ITEM1_P96_S4	We expect all operations to meet the legal and regulatory environmental requirements and believe that compliance with those regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive and financial position.
21510_18_ITEM1_P96_S5	Although we believe that our safety procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of such materials comply with the standards required by federal and state laws and regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials.
21510_18_ITEM1_P96_S6	In the event of such an accident involving such materials, we could be liable for damages and such liability could exceed the amount of our liability insurance coverage and the resources of our business.
21510_18_ITEM1_P97_S0	We face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations due to the evolving nature of environmental compliance regulations and standards, as well as specific customer compliance requirements.
21510_18_ITEM1_P97_S1	These regulations and standards have an impact on the material composition of our products entering specific markets.
21510_18_ITEM1_P97_S2	Such legislation has gone into effect at various time across the worldwide markets.
21510_18_ITEM1_P97_S3	For example, in the European Union ("EU"), the Restriction of the use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS) went into effect in 2006, and was subsequently revised in 2011 (as RoHS 2) and again in 2015 (as RoHS 2 amended) and will be in effect in 2019.
21510_18_ITEM1_P97_S4	The Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) went into effect in 2007, and is updated with additional substances every 6 months.
21510_18_ITEM1_P98_S0	China enacted the Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products Regulation (China-RoHS) in 2007, which was revised and renamed in 2016 as the Administrative Measures for the Restriction of the Use of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Products (known as China RoHS 2).
21510_18_ITEM1_P98_S1	Another example is the US Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Conflict Minerals Act) which requires manufacturers to provide disclosures about the use of specified conflict minerals emanating from the DRC and nine adjoining countries (Covered Countries).
21510_18_ITEM1_P99_S0	In addition to these regulations and directives, we may face costs and liabilities in connection with product take-back legislation.
21510_18_ITEM1_P99_S1	For example, beginning in 2006 (with several subsequent revisions), the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive 2012/19/EU made producers of electrical goods financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, recovery, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products.
21510_18_ITEM1_P99_S2	Similar laws are now pending in various jurisdictions around the world, including the United States.
21510_18_ITEM1_P100_S0	Environmental liabilities Our operations are subject to various laws and regulations governing the environment, including the discharge of pollutants and the management and disposal of hazardous substances.
21510_18_ITEM1_P100_S1	As a result of our historic as well as on-going operations, we could incur substantial costs, including remediation costs.
21510_18_ITEM1_P100_S2	The costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to predict.
21510_18_ITEM1_P100_S3	Our accruals for such costs and liabilities may not be adequate because the estimates on which the accruals are based depend on a number of factors including the nature of the matter, the complexity of the site, site geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) at multi-party sites and the number and financial viability of other PRPs.
21510_18_ITEM1_P101_S0	Regulatory Compliance Lasers that are manufactured or sold in the United States are classified under the applicable rules and regulations of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health ("CDRH") of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA").
21510_18_ITEM1_P101_S1	A similar classification system is applied in the European markets.
21510_18_ITEM1_P102_S0	CDRH regulations require a self-certification procedure pursuant to which a manufacturer must submit a filing to the CDRH with respect to each product incorporating a laser, make periodic reports of sales and purchases, and comply with product labeling standards, product safety and design features and informational requirements.
21510_18_ITEM1_P102_S1	The CDRH is empowered to seek fines and other remedies for violations of their requirements.
21510_18_ITEM1_P102_S2	We believe that our products are in material compliance with the applicable rules and regulations of CDRH relating to lasers manufactured or sold in the United States.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our operating results, including net sales, net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA in dollars and as a percentage of net sales, as well as our stock price have varied in the past, and our future operating results will continue to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations based upon numerous factors, including those discussed in this Item 1A and throughout this report.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Our stock price will continue to be subject to daily variations as well.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Our future operating results and stock price may not follow any past trends or meet our guidance and expectations.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Our net sales and operating results, such as adjusted EBITDA percentage, net income (loss) and operating expenses, and our stock price have varied in the past and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year in the future.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P0_S4	We believe a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, could cause these variations and make them difficult to predict, including:
21510_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	distraction of management related to acquisition, integration or divestment activities.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	In addition, we often recognize a substantial portion of our sales in the last month of our fiscal quarters.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Our expenses for any given quarter are typically based on expected sales and if sales are below expectations in any given quarter, the adverse impact of the shortfall on our operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P1_S3	We also base our manufacturing on our forecasted product mix for the quarter.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P1_S4	If the actual product mix varies significantly from our forecast, we may not be able to fill some orders during that quarter, which would result in delays in the shipment of our products.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Accordingly, variations in timing of sales, particularly for our higher priced, higher margin products, can cause significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Due to these and other factors, such as varying product mix, we believe that quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year comparisons of our historical operating results may not be meaningful.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P1_S7	You should not rely on our results for any quarter or year as an indication of our future performance.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P1_S8	Our operating results in future quarters and years may be below public market analysts' or investors' expectations, which would likely cause the price of our stock to fall.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P1_S9	In addition, over the past several years, U.S. and global equity markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the stock prices of many technology companies both in and outside our industry.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P1_S10	There has not always been a direct correlation between this volatility and the performance of particular companies subject to these stock price fluctuations.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P1_S11	These factors, as well as general economic and political conditions or investors' concerns regarding the credibility of corporate financial statements, may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our stock in the future.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P1_S12	We depend on sole source or limited source suppliers, as well as on our own production capabilities, for some of the key components and materials, including exotic materials, certain cutting-edge optics and crystals, used in our products, which make us susceptible to supply shortages or price fluctuations that could adversely affect our business, particularly our ability to meet our customers' delivery requirements.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We currently purchase several key components and materials used in the manufacture of our products from sole source or limited source suppliers.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	In particular, from time-to-time our customers require us to ramp up production and/or accelerate delivery schedules of our products.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Our key suppliers may not have the ability to increase their production in line with our customers' demands.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P2_S3	This can become acute during times of high growth in our customers' businesses.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Our failure to timely receive these key components and materials would likely cause delays in the shipment of our products, which would likely negatively impact both our customers and our business.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Some of these suppliers are relatively small private companies that may discontinue their operations at any time and which may be particularly susceptible to prevailing economic conditions.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Some of our suppliers are located in regions which may be susceptible to natural disasters, such as the flooding in Thailand and the earthquake, tsunami and resulting nuclear disaster in Japan and severe flooding and power loss in the Eastern part of the United States in recent years.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We typically purchase our components and materials through purchase orders or agreed upon terms and conditions, and we do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with many of these suppliers.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P3_S3	For certain long-lead time supplies or in order to lock-in pricing, we may be obligated to place non-cancellable purchase orders or otherwise assume liability for a large amount of the ordered supplies, which limits our ability to adjust down our inventory liability in the event of market downturns or other customer cancellations or rescheduling of their purchase orders for our products.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Some of our products, particularly in the flat panel display industry, require designs and specifications that are at the cutting-edge of available technologies and change frequently to meet rapidly evolving market demands.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	By their very nature, the types of components used in such products can be difficult and unpredictable to manufacture and may only be available from a single supplier, which increases the risk that we may not obtain such components in a timely manner.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Identifying alternative sources of supply for certain components could be difficult and costly, result in management distraction in assisting our current and future suppliers to meet our and our customers' technical requirements, and cause delays in shipments of our products while we identify, evaluate and test the products of alternative suppliers.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Any such delay in shipment would result in a delay or cancellation of our ability to convert such order into revenues.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Furthermore, financial or other difficulties faced by these suppliers or significant changes in demand for these components or materials could limit their availability.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P4_S5	We continue to consolidate our supply base and move supplier locations.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	products as a "safety stock" during the transition, which may cause the amount of inventory reflected on our balance sheet to increase.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Additionally, many of our customers rely on sole source suppliers.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P5_S2	In the event of a disruption of our customers' supply chain, orders from our customers could decrease or be delayed.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these components or materials, or the inability to obtain these components and materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time, or our failure to properly manage these moves, would impair our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and could cause customers to cancel orders.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Furthermore, we have historically relied exclusively on our own production capability to manufacture certain strategic components, crystals, semiconductor lasers, fiber, lasers and laser-based systems.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P5_S5	We also manufacture certain large format optics.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P5_S6	Because we manufacture, package and test these components, products and systems at our own facilities, and such components, products and systems are not readily available from other sources, any interruption in manufacturing would adversely affect our business.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P5_S7	Since many of our products have lengthy qualification periods, our ability to introduce multiple suppliers for parts may be limited.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P5_S8	In addition, our failure to achieve adequate manufacturing yields of these items at our manufacturing facilities may materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P5_S9	We participate in the microelectronics market, which requires significant research and development expenses to develop and maintain products and a failure to achieve market acceptance for our products could have a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P5_S10	The microelectronics market is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product introductions, the volatility of product supply and demand, changing customer requirements and evolving industry standards.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P5_S11	The nature of this market requires significant research and development expenses to participate, with substantial resources invested in advance of material sales of our products to our customers in this market.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P5_S12	Additionally, our product offerings may become obsolete given the frequent introduction of alternative technologies.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P5_S13	In the event either our customers' or our products fail to gain market acceptance, or the microelectronics market fails to grow, it would likely have a significant negative effect on our business and results of operations.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We participate in the flat panel display market, which has a relatively limited number of end customer manufacturers.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our backlog, timing of net sales and results of operations could be negatively impacted in the event our customers reschedule or cancel orders.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	In the flat panel display market, there are a relatively limited number of manufacturers who are the end customers for our annealing products.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	In fiscal 2018, Advanced Process Systems Corporation, an integrator in the flat panel display market based in South Korea, contributed more than 10% of our revenue.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Given macroeconomic conditions, varying consumer demand and technical process limitations at manufacturers, our customers may seek to reschedule or cancel orders.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, a customer requested a change of delivery date resulting in a significant order being rescheduled from the first to the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In addition, subsequent to year-end, one customer indicated its intent to cancel three purchase orders which included backlog shippable within 12 months of $38.2 million as well as some additional orders which were unscheduled.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	These larger flat panel-related systems have large average selling prices.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Any rescheduling or canceling of such orders by our customers will likely have a significant impact on our quarterly or annual net sales and results of operations and could negatively impact inventory values and backlog.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Additionally, challenges in meeting evolving technological requirements for these complex products by us and our suppliers could also result in delays in shipments and rescheduled or cancelled orders by our customers.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P9_S3	This could negatively impact our backlog, timing of net sales and results of operations.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P9_S4	As of September 29, 2018 , flat panel display systems represented 32% of our backlog, compared to 59% at September 30, 2017 .
21510_18_ITEM1A_P9_S5	Since our backlog includes higher average selling price flat panel display systems compared to other products in our backlog, any delays or cancellation of shipments could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P9_S6	We may not be able to integrate the business of Rofin successfully with our own, realize the anticipated benefits of the merger or manage our expanded operations, any of which would adversely affect our results of operations.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P9_S7	We have devoted, and expect to continue to devote, significant management attention and resources to integrating our business practices with those of Rofin.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P9_S8	Such integration efforts are costly due to the large number of processes, policies, procedures, locations, operations, technologies and systems to be integrated, including purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, service, operations, payroll, pricing, marketing and employee benefits.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P9_S9	Integration expenses could, particularly in the short term, exceed the savings we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale, which could result in significant charges to earnings that we cannot currently quantify.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P9_S10	Potential difficulties that we may encounter as part of the integration process include the following:
21510_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, our business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures or policies.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger, or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, difficulties in implementing our Enterprise Management Systems at one of our manufacturing sites located in Germany, which was historically part of Rofin, resulted in a shortage of manufacturing parts and shippable inventory to meet demands, resulting in a reduction of revenue for the quarter.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P10_S3	If we are unable to timely resolve these implementation issues, or if similar difficulties arise in the future at another site, we may in the future experience a shortage of parts and inventory or otherwise be unable to meet demand, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Following the merger, the size and complexity of the business of the combined company has increased significantly.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage this expanded business, which has and will pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P11_S2	There can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected synergies and benefits anticipated from the merger.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Charges to earnings resulting from the application of the purchase method of accounting to the Rofin acquisition may adversely affect our results of operations.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we have accounted for the Rofin acquisition using the purchase method of accounting.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Under the purchase method of accounting, we allocated the total purchase price of Rofin's net tangible and identifiable intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	The excess of the purchase price over net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P12_S3	We have incurred and will continue to incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P12_S4	In addition, to the extent the value of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives becomes impaired, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P12_S5	These depreciation, amortization and potential impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our indebtedness following the merger is substantially greater than our indebtedness prior to the merger.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	This increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect us, including by decreasing our business flexibility, and will increase our borrowing costs.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P13_S2	In November 2016 we entered into the Credit Agreement which provided for a 670 million Euro term loan, all of which was drawn, and a $100 million revolving credit facility, under which a 10 million Euro letter of credit was issued.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P13_S3	As of September 29, 2018, 371.6 million Euros were outstanding under the term loan and 10.0 million Euros were outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P13_S4	We may incur additional indebtedness in the future by accessing the revolving credit facility and/or entering into new financing arrangements.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal of our current indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations and the ongoing interest rate environment.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P13_S6	There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, including covenants regarding the payment of taxes and other obligations, maintenance of insurance, reporting requirements and compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and negative covenants, including covenants limiting the ability of us and our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur debt, grant liens, make investments, make certain restricted payments, transact with affiliates, and sell assets.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The Credit Agreement also requires us and our subsidiaries to maintain a senior secured net leverage ratio as of the last day of each fiscal quarter of less of than or equal to 3.50 to 1.00.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default that include, among other things, payment defaults, cross defaults with certain other indebtedness, violation of covenants, inaccuracy of representations and warranties in any material respect, change in control of us and Coherent Holding BV Co. K.G. (formerly Coherent Holding GmbH), judgment defaults, and bankruptcy and insolvency events.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	the other loan documents and applicable law.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The acceleration of such obligations is automatic upon the occurrence of a bankruptcy and insolvency event of default.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P16_S2	There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources or we will be able to arrange financing to repay our borrowings at such time.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Our substantially increased indebtedness and higher debt-to-equity ratio as a result of the merger in comparison to that prior to the merger will have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and will increase our borrowing costs.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P16_S4	In addition, the amount of cash required to service our increased indebtedness levels and thus the demands on our cash resources will be greater than the amount of cash flows required to service our indebtedness or that of Rofin individually prior to the merger.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P16_S5	The increased levels of indebtedness could also reduce funds available for our investments in product development as well as capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases and other activities and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P16_S6	Some of our laser systems are complex in design and may contain defects that are not detected until deployed by our customers, which could increase our costs and reduce our net sales.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Lasers and laser systems are inherently complex in design and require ongoing regular maintenance.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The manufacture of our lasers, laser products and systems involves a highly complex and precise process.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P17_S2	As a result of the technological complexity of our products, in particular our excimer laser annealing tools used in the flat panel display market, changes in our or our suppliers' manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective materials by us or our suppliers could result in a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and product reliability.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P17_S3	To the extent that we do not achieve and maintain our projected yields or product reliability, our business, operating results, financial condition and customer relationships would be adversely affected.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P17_S4	We provide warranties on a majority of our product sales, and reserves for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P17_S5	The determination of such reserves requires us to make estimates of failure rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P17_S6	We typically establish warranty reserves based on historical warranty costs for each product line.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P17_S7	If actual return rates and/or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates, adjustments to cost of sales may be required in future periods which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P17_S8	Our customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated, including under the end user's peak stress conditions.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P17_S9	In addition, some of our products are combined with products from other vendors, which may contain defects.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P17_S10	As a result, should problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P17_S11	If we are unable to identify and fix defects or other problems, we could experience, among other things:
21510_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	legal actions by our customers and/or their end users.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Continued volatility in the advanced packaging and semiconductor manufacturing markets could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P18_S3	A portion of our net sales in the microelectronics market depends on the demand for our products by advanced packaging applications and semiconductor equipment companies.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P18_S4	These markets have historically been characterized by sudden and severe cyclical variations in product supply and demand, which have often severely affected the demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment, including laser-based tools and systems.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P18_S5	The timing, severity and duration of these market cycles are difficult to predict, and we may not be able to respond effectively to these cycles.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P18_S6	The continuing uncertainty in these markets severely limits our ability to predict our business prospects or financial results in these markets.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P18_S7	During industry downturns, our net sales from these markets may decline suddenly and significantly.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P18_S8	Our ability to rapidly and effectively reduce our cost structure in response to such downturns is limited by the fixed nature of many of our expenses in the near term and by our need to continue our investment in next-generation product technology and to support and service our products.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P18_S9	In addition, due to the relatively long manufacturing lead times for some of the systems and subsystems we sell to these markets, we may incur expenditures or purchase raw materials or components for products we cannot sell.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Accordingly, downturns in the semiconductor capital equipment market may materially harm our operating results.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Conversely, when upturns in these markets occur, we must be able to rapidly and effectively increase our manufacturing capacity to meet increases in customer demand that may be extremely rapid, and if we fail to do so we may lose business to our competitors and our relationships with our customers may be harmed.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Worldwide economic conditions and related uncertainties could negatively impact demand for our products and results of operations.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets, depressed consumer confidence, government economic policies, negative economic conditions, volatile corporate profits and reduced capital spending could negatively impact demand for our products.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P20_S2	In particular, it is difficult to develop and implement strategy, sustainable business models and efficient operations, as well as effectively manage supply chain relationships in the face of such conditions including uncertainty regarding the ability of some of our suppliers to continue operations and provide us with uninterrupted supply flow.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Our ability to maintain our research and development investments in our broad product offerings may be adversely impacted in the event that our future sales decline or remain flat.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Spending and the timing thereof by consumers and businesses have a significant impact on our results and, where such spending is delayed or cancelled, it could have a material negative impact on our operating results.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Current global economic conditions remain uncertain and challenging.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Weakness in our end markets could negatively impact our net sales, gross margin and operating expenses, and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Uncertainty in global fiscal policy has likely had an adverse impact on global financial markets and overall economic activity in recent years.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Should this uncertain financial policy recur, it would likely negatively impact global economic activity.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Any weakness in global economies would also likely have negative repercussions on U.S. and global credit and financial markets, and further exacerbate sovereign debt concerns in the European Union.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P22_S3	All of these factors would likely adversely impact the global demand for our products and the performance of our investments, and would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets, as has occurred in recent years, could result in tighter credit markets and lower levels of liquidity in some financial markets.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	There could be a number of follow-on effects from a tightened credit environment on our business, including the insolvency of key suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and/or manufacture products resulting in product delays; inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and/or customer insolvencies; and failure of financial institutions negatively impacting our treasury functions.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P23_S2	In the event our customers are unable to obtain credit or otherwise pay for our shipped products it could significantly impact our ability to collect on our outstanding accounts receivable.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments; impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments; interest rates; cash balances; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Volatility in the financial markets and any overall economic uncertainty increase the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Uncertainty about global economic conditions could also continue to increase the volatility of our stock price.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P23_S6	In addition, political and social turmoil related to international conflicts, terrorist acts, civil unrest and mass migration may put further pressure on economic conditions in the United States and the rest of the world.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P23_S7	Unstable economic, political and social conditions make it difficult for our customers, our suppliers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P23_S8	If such conditions persist, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P23_S9	Additionally, unstable economic conditions can provide significant pressures and burdens on individuals, which could cause them to engage in inappropriate business conduct.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P23_S10	Our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are managed through various banks around the world and volatility in the capital and credit market conditions could cause financial institutions to fail or materially harm service levels provided by such banks, both of which could have an adverse impact on our ability to timely access funds.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P23_S11	World capital and credit markets have been and may continue to experience volatility and disruption.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P23_S12	In some cases, the markets have exerted downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers, as well as pressured the solvency of some financial institutions.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P23_S13	These financial institutions, including banks, have had difficulty timely performing regular services and in some cases have failed or otherwise been largely taken over by governments.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We maintain our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments with a number of financial institutions around the world.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Should some or all of these financial institutions fail or otherwise be unable to timely perform requested services, we would likely have a limited ability to timely access our cash deposited with such institutions, or, in extreme circumstances the failure of such institutions could cause us to be unable to access cash for the foreseeable future.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	If we are unable to quickly access our funds when we need them, we may need to increase the use of our existing credit lines or access more expensive credit, if available.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	to access our cash or if we access existing or additional credit or are unable to access additional credit, it could have a negative impact on our operations, including our reported net income.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	In addition, the willingness of financial institutions to continue to accept our cash deposits will impact our ability to diversify our investment risk among institutions.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P25_S2	We are exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Although we have not recognized any material losses on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, future declines in their market values could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Given the global nature of our business, we have investments both domestically and internationally.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	There has recently been growing pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, particularly in Europe where a significant portion of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are invested, which results in corresponding pressure on the valuation of the securities issued by such nations.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Additionally, our overall investment portfolio is often concentrated in government-issued securities such as U.S. Treasury securities and government agencies, corporate notes, commercial paper and money market funds.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, financial results, or other factors.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Additionally, liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations could result in decreased values for our investments in certain government securities.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P27_S4	As a result, the value or liquidity of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments could decline or become materially impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P27_S5	Our future success depends on our ability to increase our sales volumes and decrease our costs to offset potential declines in the average selling prices ("ASPs") of our products and, if we are unable to realize greater sales volumes and lower costs, our operating results may suffer.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P27_S6	Our ability to increase our sales volume and our future success depends on the continued growth of the markets for lasers, laser systems and related accessories, as well as our ability to identify, in advance, emerging markets for laser-based systems and to manage our manufacturing capacity to meet customer demands.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P27_S7	We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify, on a timely basis, new high-growth markets in the future.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P27_S8	Moreover, we cannot assure you that new markets will develop for our products or our customers' products, or that our technology or pricing will enable such markets to develop.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P27_S9	Future demand for our products is uncertain and will depend to a great degree on continued technological development and the introduction of new or enhanced products.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P27_S10	If this does not continue, sales of our products may decline and our business will be harmed.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P27_S11	We have in the past experienced decreases in the ASPs of some of our products.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P27_S12	As competing products become more widely available, the ASPs of our products may decrease.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P27_S13	If we are unable to offset any decrease in our ASPs by increasing our sales volumes, our net sales will decline.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P27_S14	In addition, to maintain our gross margins, we must continue to reduce the cost of manufacturing our products while maintaining their high quality.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	From time to time, our products, like many complex technological products, may fail in greater frequency than anticipated.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	This can lead to further charges, which can result in higher costs, lower gross margins and lower operating results.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Furthermore, as ASPs of our current products decline, we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements with higher margins.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P28_S3	If we cannot maintain our gross margins, our operating results could be seriously harmed, particularly if the ASPs of our products decrease significantly.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Our future success depends on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new and enhanced products that meet the needs of our customers.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Our current products address a broad range of commercial and scientific research applications in the photonics markets.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P28_S6	We cannot assure you that the market for these applications will continue to generate significant or consistent demand for our products.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P28_S7	Demand for our products could be significantly diminished by disrupting technologies or products that replace them or render them obsolete.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P28_S8	Furthermore, the new and enhanced products in certain markets generally continue to be smaller in size and have lower ASPs, and therefore, we have to sell more units to maintain revenue levels.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P28_S9	Accordingly, we must continue to invest in research and development in order to develop competitive products.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P28_S10	Our future success depends on our ability to anticipate our customers' needs and develop products that address those needs.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P28_S11	Introduction of new products and product enhancements will require that we effectively transfer production processes from research and development to manufacturing and coordinate our efforts with those of our suppliers to achieve volume production rapidly.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P28_S12	If we fail to transfer production processes effectively, develop product enhancements or introduce new products in sufficient quantities to meet the needs of our customers as scheduled, our net sales may be reduced and our business may be harmed.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P28_S13	We face risks associated with our foreign operations and sales that could harm our financial condition and results of operations.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	For fiscal 2018 , fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 , 84% , 83% and 76% , respectively, of our net sales were derived from customers outside of the United States.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We anticipate that foreign sales, particularly in Asia, will continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales in the foreseeable future.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P29_S2	A global economic slowdown or a natural disaster could have a negative effect on various foreign markets in which we operate, such as the earthquake, tsunami and resulting nuclear disaster in Japan and the flooding in Thailand in recent years.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Such a slowdown may cause us to reduce our presence in certain countries, which may negatively affect the overall level of business in such countries.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our foreign sales are primarily through our direct sales force.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Additionally, some foreign sales are made through foreign distributors and representatives.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Our foreign operations and sales are subject to a number of risks, including:
21510_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our business could also be impacted by international conflicts, terrorist and military activity including, in particular, any such conflicts on the Korean peninsula, civil unrest and pandemic illness which could cause a slowdown in customer orders, cause customer order cancellations or negatively impact availability of supplies or limit our ability to timely service our installed base of products.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	We are also subject to the risks of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, which could materially adversely affect the sales price of our products in foreign markets, as well as the costs and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P31_S2	While we use forward exchange contracts and other risk management techniques to hedge our foreign currency exposure, we remain exposed to the economic risks of foreign currency fluctuations.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P31_S3	If we are unable to protect our proprietary technology, our competitive advantage could be harmed.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Maintenance of intellectual property rights and the protection thereof is important to our business.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P31_S5	We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P31_S6	Our patent applications may not be approved, any patents that may be issued may not sufficiently protect our intellectual property and any issued patents may be challenged by third parties.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P31_S7	Other parties may independently develop similar or competing technology or design around any patents that may be issued to us.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P31_S8	We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P31_S9	Further, we may be required to enforce our intellectual property or other proprietary rights through litigation, which, regardless of success, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management's attention.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	pertinent to our business and it is not possible for us to know whether there are patent applications pending that our products might infringe upon since these applications are often not publicly available until a patent is issued or published.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	We may, in the future, be subject to claims or litigation from third parties, for claims of infringement of their proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of competitors or other rights holders.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P32_S2	These claims could result in costly litigation and the diversion of our technical and management personnel.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Adverse resolution of litigation may harm our operating results or financial condition.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	In recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States and around the world involving patents and other intellectual property rights.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P33_S1	This has been seen in our industry, for example in the concluded patent-related litigation between IMRA America, Inc. ("Imra") and IPG Photonics Corporation and in Imra's concluded patent-related litigation against two of our German subsidiaries.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	From time to time, like many other technology companies, we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights, copyrights, trademark rights or other intellectual property rights which such third parties believe may cover certain of our products, processes, technologies or information.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	In the future, we may be a party to litigation to protect our intellectual property or as a result of an alleged infringement of others' intellectual property whether through direct claims or by way of indemnification claims of our customers, as, in some cases, we contractually agree to indemnify our customers against third-party infringement claims relating to our products.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P34_S2	These claims and any resulting lawsuit, if successful, could subject us to significant liability for damages or invalidation of our proprietary rights.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P34_S3	These lawsuits, regardless of their success, would likely be time-consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Any potential intellectual property litigation could also force us to do one or more of the following:
21510_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	redesign the products that use the technology.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P35_S1	If we are forced to take any of these actions or are otherwise a party to lawsuits of this nature, we may incur significant losses and our business may be seriously harmed.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P35_S2	We do not have insurance to cover potential claims of this type.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P35_S3	If our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Factors that may be considered in determining whether a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable include declines in our stock price and market capitalization or future cash flows projections.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P36_S3	A decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in market conditions, particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we used to calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units, could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an impairment charge.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Any such material charges, whether related to goodwill or purchased intangible assets, may have a material negative impact on our financial and operating results.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P36_S5	We depend on skilled personnel to operate our business effectively in a rapidly changing market, and if we are unable to retain existing or hire additional personnel when needed, our ability to develop and sell our products could be harmed.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P36_S6	Our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel will be a critical factor in determining whether we will be successful in the future.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Recruiting and retaining highly skilled personnel in certain functions continues to be difficult.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P37_S1	At certain locations where we operate, the cost of living is extremely high and it may be difficult to retain key employees and management at a reasonable cost.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P37_S2	We may not be successful in attracting, assimilating or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs, which could adversely affect our growth and our business.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P37_S3	Our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and support personnel, any of whom may leave and our ability to effectively transition to their successors.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P37_S4	Our inability to retain or to effectively transition to their successors could harm our business and our results of operations.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P37_S5	The long sales cycles for our products may cause us to incur significant expenses without offsetting net sales.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P37_S6	Customers often view the purchase of our products as a significant and strategic decision.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P37_S7	As a result, customers typically expend significant effort in evaluating, testing and qualifying our products before making a decision to purchase them, resulting in a lengthy initial sales cycle.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We may also expend significant management efforts, increase manufacturing capacity and order long lead-time components or materials prior to receiving an order.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Even after this evaluation process, a potential customer may not purchase our products.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P38_S2	As a result, these long sales cycles may cause us to incur significant expenses without ever receiving net sales to offset such expenses.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The markets in which we sell our products are intensely competitive and increased competition could cause reduced sales levels, reduced gross margins or the loss of market share.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Competition in the various photonics markets in which we provide products is very intense.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P39_S2	We compete against a number of large public and private companies, including IPG Photonics Corporation, Lumentum Holdings Inc., MKS Instruments, Inc., Novanta Inc., nLIGHT, Inc. and TRUMPF GmbH, as well as other smaller companies.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Some of our competitors are large companies that have significant financial, technical, marketing and other resources.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P39_S4	These competitors may be able to devote greater resources than we can to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P39_S5	Some of our competitors are much better positioned than we are to acquire other companies in order to gain new technologies or products that may displace our product lines.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P39_S6	Any of these acquisitions could give our competitors a strategic advantage.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P39_S7	Any business combinations or mergers among our competitors, forming larger companies with greater resources, could result in increased competition, price reductions, reduced margins or loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P39_S8	Additional competitors may enter the markets in which we serve, both foreign and domestic, and we are likely to compete with new companies in the future.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P39_S9	We may encounter potential customers that, due to existing relationships with our competitors, are committed to the products offered by these competitors.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P39_S10	Further, our current or potential customers may determine to develop and produce products for their own use which are competitive to our products.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P39_S11	Such vertical integration could reduce the market opportunity for our products.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P39_S12	As a result of the foregoing factors, we expect that competitive pressures may result in price reductions, reduced margins, loss of sales and loss of market share.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P39_S13	In addition, in markets where there are a limited number of customers, competition is particularly intense.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P39_S14	If we fail to accurately forecast component and material requirements for our products, we could incur additional costs and incur significant delays in shipments, which could result in a loss of customers.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P39_S15	We use rolling forecasts based on anticipated product orders and material requirements planning systems to determine our product requirements.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P39_S16	It is very important that we accurately predict both the demand for our products and the lead times required to obtain the necessary components and materials.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P39_S17	We depend on our suppliers for most of our product components and materials.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P39_S18	Lead times for components and materials that we order vary significantly and depend on factors including the specific supplier requirements, the size of the order, contract terms and current market demand for components.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P39_S19	For substantial increases in our sales levels of certain products, some of our suppliers may need at least nine months lead-time.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P39_S20	If we overestimate our component and material requirements, we may have excess inventory, which would increase our costs.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P39_S21	If we underestimate our component and material requirements, we may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt and delay delivery of our products to our customers.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P39_S22	Any of these occurrences would negatively impact our net sales, business or operating results.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P39_S23	Our reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing may adversely impact our financial results and operations due to our decreased control over the performance and timing of certain aspects of our manufacturing.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P39_S24	Our manufacturing strategy includes partnering with contract manufacturers to outsource non-core subassemblies and less complex turnkey products, including some performed at international sites located in Asia and Eastern Europe.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P39_S25	Our ability to resume internal manufacturing operations for certain products and components in a timely manner may be eliminated.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P39_S26	The cost, quality, performance and availability of contract manufacturing operations are and will be essential to the successful production and sale of many of our products.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P39_S27	Our financial condition or results of operation could be adversely impacted if any contract manufacturer or other supplier is unable for any reason, including as a result of the impact of worldwide economic conditions, to meet our cost, quality, performance, and availability standards.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P39_S28	We may not be able to provide contract manufacturers with product volumes that are high enough to achieve sufficient cost savings.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P39_S29	If shipments fall below forecasted levels, we may incur increased costs or be required to take ownership of the inventory.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P39_S30	Also, our ability to control the quality of products produced by contract manufacturers may be limited and quality issues may not be resolved in a timely manner, which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P39_S31	If we fail to effectively manage our growth or, alternatively, our spending during downturns, our business could be disrupted, which could harm our operating results.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P39_S32	Growth in sales, combined with the challenges of managing geographically dispersed operations, can place a significant strain on our management systems and resources, and our anticipated growth in future operations could continue to place such a strain.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P39_S33	The failure to effectively manage our growth could disrupt our business and harm our operating results.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in evolving markets requires an effective planning and management process.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P40_S1	In economic downturns, we must effectively manage our spending and operations to ensure our competitive position during the downturn, as well as our future opportunities when the economy improves, remain intact.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P40_S2	The failure to effectively manage our spending and operations could disrupt our business and harm our operating results.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Historically, acquisitions have been an important element of our strategy.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P41_S1	However, we may not find suitable acquisition candidates in the future and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Any acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P41_S3	We have in the past made strategic acquisitions of other corporations and entities, including OR Laser in March 2018 and Rofin in November 2016, as well as asset purchases, and we continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions of complementary companies, products and technologies.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P41_S4	In the event of any future acquisitions, we could:
21510_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	incur expenses related to impairment of goodwill and amortization.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Acquisitions also involve numerous risks, including:
21510_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	the failure to complete acquisitions even after signing definitive agreements which, among other things, would result in the expensing of potentially significant professional fees and other charges in the period in which the acquisition or negotiations are terminated.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify appropriate acquisition candidates, to integrate any businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future or achieve the anticipated benefits of such transactions, which may harm our business.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Our market is unpredictable and characterized by rapid technological changes and evolving standards demanding a significant investment in research and development, and, if we fail to address changing market conditions, our business and operating results will be harmed.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The photonics industry is characterized by extensive research and development, rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Because this industry is subject to rapid change, it is difficult to predict its potential size or future growth rate.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Our success in generating net sales in this industry will depend on, among other things:
21510_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	our ability to accurately predict and develop our products to meet industry standards.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We cannot assure you that our expenditures for research and development will result in the introduction of new products or, if such products are introduced, that those products will achieve sufficient market acceptance or to generate sales to offset the costs of development.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Our failure to address rapid technological changes in our markets could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P46_S2	We are exposed to lawsuits in the normal course of business which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P46_S3	We are exposed to lawsuits in the normal course of our business, including product liability claims, if personal injury, death or commercial losses occur from the use of our products.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	As a public company our stock price fluctuates for a variety of different reasons, some of which may be related to broader industry and/or market factors.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P47_S1	As a result, from time-to-time we may be subject to the risk of litigation due to the fluctuation in stock price or other governance or market-related factors.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P47_S2	While we typically maintain business insurance, including directors' and officers' policies, litigation can be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations, including the potential impact of indemnification obligations for individuals named in any such lawsuits.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P47_S3	We may not, however, be able to secure insurance coverage on terms acceptable to us in the future.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P47_S4	Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P47_S5	An unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit, including a recall or redesign of products if ultimately determined to be defective, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P47_S6	We use standard laboratory and manufacturing materials that could be considered hazardous and we could be liable for any damage or liability resulting from accidental environmental contamination or injury.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P47_S7	Although most of our products do not incorporate hazardous or toxic materials and chemicals, some of the gases used in our excimer lasers and some of the liquid dyes used in some of our scientific laser products are highly toxic.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P47_S8	In addition, our operations involve the use of standard laboratory and manufacturing materials that could be considered hazardous.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P47_S9	Also, if a facility fire were to occur at our Sunnyvale, California site and were to spread to a reactor used to grow semiconductor wafers, it could release highly toxic emissions.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P47_S10	We believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with all federal, state and offshore regulations and standards.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P47_S11	However, the risk of accidental environmental contamination or injury from such materials cannot be entirely eliminated.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P47_S12	In the event of such an accident involving such materials, we could be liable for damages and such liability could exceed the amount of our liability insurance coverage and the resources of our business which could have an adverse effect on our financial results or our business as a whole.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P47_S13	Compliance or the failure to comply with current and future environmental regulations could cause us significant expense.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process or requiring design changes or recycling of products we manufacture.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P48_S1	If we fail to comply with any present and future regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities, the suspension of production or a prohibition on the sale of products we manufacture.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P48_S2	In addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment, or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations, including expenses associated with the recall of any non-compliant product and the management of historical waste.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P48_S3	From time to time new regulations are enacted, and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P48_S4	We continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P48_S5	These regulations include, for example, the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical substances ("REACH"), the Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive ("RoHS") and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive ("WEEE") enacted in the European Union, which regulate the use of certain hazardous substances in, and require the collection, reuse and recycling of waste from, certain products we manufacture.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P48_S6	This and similar legislation that has been or is in the process of being enacted in Japan, China, South Korea and various states of the United States may require us to re-design our products to ensure compliance with the applicable standards, for example by requiring the use of different types of materials.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P48_S7	These redesigns or alternative materials may detrimentally impact the performance of our products, add greater testing lead-times for product introductions or have other similar effects.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P48_S8	We believe we comply with all such legislation where our products are sold and we will continue to monitor these laws and the regulations being adopted under them to determine our responsibilities.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P48_S9	In addition, we are monitoring legislation relating to the reduction of carbon emissions from industrial operations to determine whether we may be required to incur any additional material costs or expenses associated with our operations.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P48_S10	We are not currently aware of any such material costs or expenses.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The SEC has promulgated rules requiring disclosure regarding the use of certain "conflict minerals" mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and procedures regarding a manufacturer's efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	or contractual obligations could result in our being directly or indirectly liable for costs, fines or penalties and third-party claims, and could jeopardize our ability to conduct business in the United States and foreign countries.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Our and our customers' operations would be seriously harmed if our logistics or facilities or those of our suppliers, our customers' suppliers or our contract manufacturers were to experience catastrophic loss.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Our operations, logistics and facilities and those of our customers, suppliers and contract manufacturers could be subject to a catastrophic loss from fire, flood, earthquake, volcanic eruption, work stoppages, power outages, acts of war, pandemic illnesses, energy shortages, theft of assets, other natural disasters or terrorist activity.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	A substantial portion of our research and development activities, manufacturing, our corporate headquarters and other critical business operations are located near major earthquake faults in Santa Clara, California, an area with a history of seismic events.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Any such loss or detrimental impact to any of our operations, logistics or facilities could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and net sales and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P51_S2	While we have obtained insurance to cover most potential losses, after reviewing the costs and limitations associated with earthquake insurance, we have decided not to procure such insurance.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P51_S3	We believe that this decision is consistent with decisions reached by numerous other companies located nearby.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P51_S4	We cannot assure you that our existing insurance coverage will be adequate against all other possible losses.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P51_S5	Difficulties with our enterprise resource planning ("ERP") system and other parts of our global information technology system could harm our business and results of operation.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P51_S6	If our network security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer's data or our data or our information technology systems, we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Like many modern multinational corporations, we maintain a global information technology system, including software products licensed from third parties.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Any system, network or Internet failures, misuse by system users, the hacking into or disruption caused by the unauthorized access by third parties or loss of license rights could disrupt our ability to timely and accurately manufacture and ship products or to report our financial information in compliance with the timelines mandated by the SEC.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Any such failure, misuse, hacking, disruptions or loss would likely cause a diversion of management's attention from the underlying business and could harm our operations.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P52_S3	In addition, a significant failure of our global information technology system could adversely affect our ability to complete an evaluation of our internal controls and attestation activities pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Our information systems are subject to attacks, interruptions and failures.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P53_S1	As part of our day-to-day business, we store our data and certain data about our customers in our global information technology system.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P53_S2	While our system is designed with access security, if a third party gains unauthorized access to our data, including any regarding our customers, such a security breach could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, loss of business, litigation and possible liability.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P53_S3	Our security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P53_S4	Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers' data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P53_S5	Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P53_S6	Any unauthorized access could result in a loss of confidence by our customers, damage our reputation, disrupt our business, lead to legal liability and negatively impact our future sales.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P53_S7	Additionally, such actions could result in significant costs associated with loss of our intellectual property, impairment of our ability to conduct our operations, rebuilding our network and systems, prosecuting and defending litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages or taking other remedial steps.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P53_S8	Changes in tax rates, tax liabilities or tax accounting rules could affect future results.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries and jurisdictions.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Significant judgment is required to determine our worldwide tax liabilities.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P54_S2	A number of factors may affect our future effective tax rates including, but not limited to:
21510_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	changes in generally accepted accounting principles.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P55_S1	As indicated above, we are engaged in discussions with various tax authorities regarding the appropriate level of profitability for Coherent entities and this may result in changes to our worldwide tax liabilities.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P55_S2	In addition, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and other tax authorities.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P55_S3	We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P55_S4	Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P56_S0	From time to time the United States, foreign and state governments make substantive changes to tax rules and the application of rules to companies.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P56_S1	For example, the Tax Act has a significant impact on the taxation of Coherent including the U.S. tax treatment of our foreign operations.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P56_S2	The recent U.S. tax law changes are subject to further interpretations from the U.S. federal and state governments and regulatory organizations, such as the Treasury Department and/or the Internal Revenue Service.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P56_S3	Updated guidance and interpretations could change the provisional tax liabilities or the accounting treatment of them.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We may pay the transition tax calculated under the Tax Act over a period of up to eight years.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Federal securities laws, rules and regulations, as well as the rules and regulations of self-regulatory organizations such as NASDAQ and the NYSE, require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures, impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements, set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers, chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P59_S1	These laws, rules and regulations have increased and will continue to increase the scope, complexity and cost of our corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices, which could harm our results of operations and divert management's attention from business operations.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P60_S1	New or changed laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P60_S2	As a result, their application in practice may evolve over time.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We are committed to maintaining high standards of ethics, corporate governance and public disclosure.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Complying with evolving interpretations of new or changed legal requirements may cause us to incur higher costs as we revise current practices, policies and procedures, and may divert management time and attention from revenue generating to compliance activities.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P61_S2	If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, our reputation may also be harmed.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Governmental regulations, including tariffs and duties, affecting the import or export of products could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P62_S0	The United States, Germany, the European Union, the United Kingdom, China, South Korea and many other foreign governments impose tariffs and duties on the import and export of products, including some of those which we sell.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P63_S0	repair work as well as on certain of our products which are manufactured by our foreign subsidiaries.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P63_S1	These products can be subject to a duty on the product value.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Additionally, the United States and various foreign governments have imposed tariffs, controls, export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies, especially encryption technology.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P63_S3	From time to time, government agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology, such as requiring the escrow and governmental recovery of private encryption keys.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P63_S4	Governmental regulation of encryption technology and regulation of imports or exports, or our failure to obtain required import or export licenses or other approvals for our products, could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our net sales.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P64_S0	The U.S. has recently instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or termination of trade agreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the United States, including, in particular, on Chinese goods, economic sanctions on individuals, corporations or countries and other government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries where we conduct our business.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P64_S1	These policy changes and proposals could require time-consuming and expensive alterations to our business operations and may result in greater restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade, which could negatively impact our competitiveness in jurisdictions around the world as well as lead to an increase in costs in our supply chain.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Given that we are a multinational corporation, with manufacturing located both in the United States and internationally, we may face additional susceptibility to negative impacts from these tariffs or change in trade policies regarding our inter-company trade practices.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P64_S3	For example, we have recently seen a drop in export demand for our Chinese customers particularly in the materials processing space.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P64_S4	As a result, some of these customers are reevaluating expansion plans and delaying and, in limited cases, cancelling orders.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P64_S5	In addition, new tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governments, including the Chinese government (which has imposed retaliatory tariffs on a range of U.S. goods including certain photonics products), have instituted or are considering imposing trade sanctions on certain U.S. manufactured goods.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P64_S6	Such changes by the United States and other countries have the potential to adversely impact U.S. and worldwide economic conditions, our industry and the global demand for our products, and as a result, could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P65_S0	As a multinational corporation, we may be subject to audits by tax, export and customs authorities, as well as other government agencies.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P65_S1	For example, we were audited in South Korea for customs duties and value added tax for the period from March 2009 to March 2014.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P65_S2	We were liable for additional payments, duties, taxes and penalties of $1.6 million, which we paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2016.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P65_S3	Any future audits could lead to assessments that could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P66_S0	In addition, compliance with the directives of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls ("DDTC") may result in substantial expenses and diversion of management's attention.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Any failure to adequately address the directives of DDTC could result in civil fines or suspension or loss of our export privileges, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P66_S2	Failure to maintain effective internal controls may cause a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements or to cause us to delay filing our periodic reports with the SEC and adversely affect our stock price.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P67_S0	The SEC, as directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on Form 10-K that contain an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P67_S1	In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P67_S2	Although we test our internal control over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with the Section 404 requirements, our failure to maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements or a delay in our ability to timely file our periodic reports with the SEC, which ultimately could negatively impact our stock price.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P67_S3	Provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law, and our Change-of-Control Severance Plan, may have anti-takeover effects that could prevent or delay a change in control.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P67_S4	Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as the terms of our Change-of-Control Severance Plan, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition, make a merger or acquisition more costly for a potential acquirer, or make removal of incumbent directors or officers more difficult.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P67_S5	These provisions may discourage takeover attempts and bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P68_S0	establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P69_S0	We are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a merger, asset or stock sale or other transaction with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date such person became an interested stockholder, unless prior approval of our board of directors is obtained or as otherwise provided.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P69_S1	These provisions of Delaware law also may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us without obtaining the prior approval of our board of directors, which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P70_S0	In addition, we have adopted a change of control severance plan, which provides for the payment of a cash severance benefit to each eligible employee based on the employee's position.
21510_18_ITEM1A_P70_S1	If a change of control occurs, our successor or acquirer will be required to assume and agree to perform all of our obligations under the change of control severance plan which may discourage potential acquirers or result in a lower stock price.
21510_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	_________________________________________ (1) This facility is utilized primarily by our ILS operating segment.
21510_18_ITEM2_P1_S0	(2) This facility is utilized primarily by our OLS operating segment.
21510_18_ITEM2_P2_S0	* We currently plan to renew leases on buildings as they expire, as necessary.
21510_18_ITEM2_P2_S1	We maintain other sales and service offices under varying leases expiring from fiscal 2019 through 2023 in Japan, China, Taiwan, South Korea, Canada, France, Italy, Germany, Belgium, Spain, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.
21510_18_ITEM2_P2_S2	We consider our facilities to be both suitable and adequate to provide for current and near term requirements and that the productive capacity in our facilities is substantially being utilized or we have plans to utilize it.
21510_18_ITEM3_P0_S0	Although we do not expect that such legal claims and litigation will ultimately have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, an adverse result in one or more matters could negatively affect our results in the period in which they occur.
21510_18_ITEM3_P1_S0	The United States and many foreign governments impose tariffs and duties on the import and export of certain products we sell or regulate the export of certain products we sell.
21510_18_ITEM3_P1_S1	From time to time our customs compliance, product classifications, duty calculations and payments are reviewed or audited by government agencies.
21510_18_ITEM3_P1_S2	For example, one of the company s German subsidiaries is currently under review by applicable German authorities regarding certain historical exports of products.
21510_18_ITEM3_P1_S3	Historically these reviews, even where violations have been cited and fines or other actions have been taken, have not resulted in materially negative consequences to the company.
21510_18_ITEM3_P1_S4	In the future any results of such matters could, however, have materially negative effects on the company.
21510_18_ITEM3_P2_S0	Income Tax Audits We are subject to taxation and file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions.
21510_18_ITEM3_P2_S1	Our most significant tax jurisdictions are the U.S. and Germany.
21510_18_ITEM3_P2_S2	For U.S. federal and German income tax purposes, all years prior to fiscal 2015 and 2010, respectively, are closed to examination.
21510_18_ITEM3_P2_S3	In our other major foreign jurisdictions and our major state jurisdictions, the years prior to fiscal 2012 and 2014, respectively, are closed.
21510_18_ITEM3_P2_S4	Earlier years in our various jurisdictions may remain open for adjustment to the extent that we have tax attribute carryforwards from those years.
21510_18_ITEM3_P3_S0	In the U.S., a legacy Rofin entity is under audit for fiscal 2016.
21510_18_ITEM3_P3_S1	In Germany, various Coherent and legacy Rofin entities are under audit for the years 2010 through 2016.
21510_18_ITEM3_P4_S0	The timing and the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year.
21510_18_ITEM3_P4_S1	Management believes that it has adequately provided for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.
21510_18_ITEM3_P5_S0	We regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions.
21510_18_ITEM3_P5_S1	Although the timing of resolution, settlement and closure of audits is not certain, we do not believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months.
21510_18_ITEM5_P0_S0	The number of stockholders of record as of November 23, 2018 was 526 .
21510_18_ITEM5_P1_S0	While we paid a cash dividend in fiscal 2013 and may elect to pay dividends in the future, we have no present intention to declare cash dividends.
21510_18_ITEM5_P1_S1	Our line of credit agreement, signed on November 7, 2016, includes certain restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends.
21510_18_ITEM5_P1_S2	There were no sales of unregistered securities in fiscal 2018 .

21510_18_ITEM5_P5_S0	The information contained above under the caption "Company Stock Price Performance" shall not be deemed to be "soliciting material" or to be "filed" with the SEC, nor will such information be incorporated by reference into any future SEC filing except to the extent that we specifically incorporate it by reference into such filing.
21510_18_ITEM6_P0_S0	We derived the consolidated statement of operations data for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of fiscal 2018 and 2017 year-end from our audited consolidated financial statements, and accompanying notes, contained in this annual report.
21510_18_ITEM6_P0_S1	The consolidated statements of operations data for fiscal 2015 and 2014 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 year-end are derived from our audited consolidated financial statements which are not included in this annual report.
21510_18_ITEM6_P1_S0	* In November 2015, the FASB issued amended guidance that clarifies that in a classified statement of financial position, an entity shall classify deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent amounts.
21510_18_ITEM6_P1_S1	The new guidance superseded ASC 740-10-45-5 which required the valuation allowance for a particular tax jurisdiction be allocated between current and noncurrent deferred tax assets for that tax jurisdiction on a pro rata basis.
21510_18_ITEM6_P1_S2	We elected to early adopt the standard retrospectively in fiscal 2016, which resulted in the reclassification of current deferred income tax assets to non-current deferred income tax assets and non-current deferred income tax liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015.
21510_18_ITEM6_P1_S3	The impact of the reclassifications to deferred tax assets and liabilities for fiscal 2014 were immaterial.
21510_18_ITEM6_P1_S4	_______________________________________________________________________________ (1) Includes $2.9 million of after-tax restructuring charges, $0.8 million impairment and other charges, $0.7 million of after-tax acquisition costs, $0.6 million of after-tax amortization of purchase accounting step-up, $26.7 million of tax charges due to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act transition tax and deferred tax remeasurement, $3.3 million tax charge due to an increase in valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and $12.8 million of tax benefit from the adoption of new rules for accounting for excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies for employee stock-based compensation.

21510_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS Below is a summary of some of the quantitative performance indicators (as defined below) that are evaluated by management to assess our financial performance.
21510_18_ITEM7_P0_S1	Some of the indicators are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered as an alternative to any other measure for determining operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
21510_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	Definitions and analysis of these performance indicators are as follows: Net Sales Net sales include sales of lasers, laser tools, related accessories and service.
21510_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	Net sales for fiscal 2018 increased 10.1% in our OLS segment and increased 10.9% in our ILS segment from fiscal 2017 .
21510_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	due to Rofin net sales since the acquisition on November 7, 2016.
21510_18_ITEM7_P2_S1	For a description of additional reasons for changes in net sales refer to the "Results of Operations" section below.
21510_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	Gross Profit as a Percentage of Net Sales Gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit percentage") is calculated as gross profit for the period divided by net sales for the period.
21510_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	Gross profit percentage for OLS decreased to 52.7% in fiscal 2018 from 53.6% in fiscal 2017 and increased from 48.3% in fiscal 2016 .
21510_18_ITEM7_P3_S2	Gross profit percentage for ILS increased to 26.7% in fiscal 2018 from 24.4% in fiscal 2017 and from 26.0% in fiscal 2016 .
21510_18_ITEM7_P3_S3	For a description of the reasons for changes in gross profit refer to the "Results of Operations" section below.
21510_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	Research and Development as a Percentage of Net Sales Research and development as a percentage of net sales ("R D percentage") is calculated as research and development expense for the period divided by net sales for the period.
21510_18_ITEM7_P4_S1	Management considers R D percentage to be an important indicator in managing our business as investing in new technologies is a key to future growth.
21510_18_ITEM7_P4_S2	R D percentage increased slightly to 7.0% in fiscal 2018 from 6.9% in fiscal 2017 and decreased from 9.5% in fiscal 2016 .
21510_18_ITEM7_P4_S3	For a description of the reasons for changes in R D spending refer to the "Results of Operations" section below.
21510_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows primarily represents the excess of cash collected from billings to our customers and other receipts over cash paid to our vendors for expenses and inventory purchases to run our business.
21510_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	We believe that cash flows from operations is an important performance indicator because cash generation over the long term is essential to maintaining a healthy business and providing funds to help fuel growth.
21510_18_ITEM7_P5_S2	For a description of the reasons for changes in Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities refer to the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section below.
21510_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	Days Sales Outstanding in Receivables We calculate days sales outstanding ("DSO") in receivables as net receivables at the end of the period divided by net sales during the period and then multiplied by the number of days in the period, using 360 days for years.
21510_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	DSO in receivables indicates how well we are managing our collection of receivables, with lower DSO in receivables resulting in higher working capital availability.
21510_18_ITEM7_P6_S2	The more money we have tied up in receivables, the less money we have available for research and development, acquisitions, expansion, marketing and other activities to grow our business.
21510_18_ITEM7_P6_S3	Our DSO in receivables for fiscal 2018 increased to 67.2 days from 63.9 days in fiscal 2017 .
21510_18_ITEM7_P6_S4	The increase in DSO in receivables was primarily due to a higher concentration of sales in the last two months of fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 in Asia and Japan including higher sales of ELA tools used in the flat panel display market and the timing of collection of those receivables, as well as slower collections on receivables in the U.S. Annualized Fourth Quarter Inventory Turns We calculate annualized fourth quarter inventory turns as cost of sales during the fourth quarter annualized and divided by net inventories at the end of the fourth quarter.
21510_18_ITEM7_P6_S5	This indicates how well we are managing our inventory levels, with higher inventory turns resulting in more working capital availability and a higher return on our investments in inventory.
21510_18_ITEM7_P6_S6	Our annualized fourth quarter inventory turns for fiscal 2018 decreased to 2.2 turns from 2.6 turns in fiscal 2017 primarily as a result of increased levels of inventory due to a temporary decrease in demand for sales of our large ELA tools, slightly offset by increased service inventory demand due to the increased installed base of such tools.
21510_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	Capital Spending as a Percentage of Net Sales Capital spending as a percentage of net sales ("capital spending percentage") is calculated as capital expenditures for the period divided by net sales for the period.
21510_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	Capital spending percentage indicates the extent to which we are expanding or improving our operations, including investments in technology and equipment.
21510_18_ITEM7_P7_S2	Management monitors capital spending levels as this assists us in measuring our cash flows, net of capital expenditures.
21510_18_ITEM7_P7_S3	Our capital spending percentage increased to 4.8% in fiscal 2018 from 3.7% in fiscal 2017 .
21510_18_ITEM7_P7_S4	Our capital spending percentage decreased to 3.7% in fiscal 2017 from 5.8% in fiscal 2016 .
21510_18_ITEM7_P7_S5	The fiscal 2018 increase was primarily due to investments made to expand our manufacturing capacity in several manufacturing sites in Germany and South Korea, higher purchases of production-related assets and higher spending on information technology infrastructure and office consolidations to support our integration of Rofin.
21510_18_ITEM7_P7_S6	These increases were partially offset by higher revenues in fiscal 2018.
21510_18_ITEM7_P7_S7	The fiscal 2017 decrease was primarily due to the impact of higher revenues in fiscal 2017 partially offset by investments to expand our manufacturing capacity in G ttingen, Germany, incremental capital spending due to our acquisition of Rofin in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the upgrade of certain of our production facilities in California and higher purchases of production-related assets.
21510_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	We define adjusted EBITDA as operating income adjusted for depreciation, amortization, stock compensation expense, major restructuring costs and certain other non-operating income and expense items, such as costs related to our acquisitions.
21510_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	Key initiatives to reach our goals for EBITDA improvements include utilization of our Asian manufacturing locations, optimizing our supply chain and continued leveraging of our infrastructure.
21510_18_ITEM7_P8_S2	We utilize a number of different financial measures, both GAAP and non-GAAP, such as adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales, in analyzing and assessing our overall business performance, for making operating decisions and for forecasting and planning future periods.
21510_18_ITEM7_P8_S3	We consider the use of non-GAAP financial measures helpful in assessing our current financial performance and ongoing operations.
21510_18_ITEM7_P8_S4	While we use non-GAAP financial measures as a tool to enhance our understanding of certain aspects of our financial performance, we do not consider these measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial measures.
21510_18_ITEM7_P8_S5	We provide adjusted EBITDA in order to enhance investors' understanding of our ongoing operations.
21510_18_ITEM7_P8_S6	This measure is used by some investors when assessing our performance.
21510_18_ITEM7_P8_S7	Below is the reconciliation of our net income from continuing operations as a percentage of net sales to our adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales:
21510_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	SIGNIFICANT EVENTS Acquisitions, divestitures and related financing On April 27, 2018, we completed the sale of several entities that we acquired in the Rofin acquisition.
21510_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	See Note 18, "Discontinued Operations and Sale of Assets Held for Sale" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of this annual report for further discussion of the divestiture.
21510_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	On March 8, 2018, we acquired privately held O.R. Lasertechnologie GmbH and certain assets of its U.S.-based affiliate (collectively "OR Laser") for approximately $47.4 million, excluding transaction costs.
21510_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	OR Laser produces laser-based material processing equipment for a variety of uses, including additive manufacturing, welding, cladding, marking, engraving and drilling.
21510_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	See Note 3, "Business Combinations" in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of this annual report for further discussion of the acquisition.
21510_18_ITEM7_P11_S2	On November 7, 2016 , we completed our acquisition of Rofin pursuant to the Merger Agreement dated March 16, 2016.
21510_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	Rofin was one of the world's leading developers and manufacturers of high-performance industrial laser sources and laser-based solutions and components.
21510_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	The acquisition was an all-cash transaction at a price of $32.50 per share of Rofin common stock.
21510_18_ITEM7_P12_S2	The aggregate consideration paid by us to the former Rofin stockholders was approximately $904.5 million , excluding related transaction fees and expenses.
21510_18_ITEM7_P12_S3	We also paid $15.3 million due to the cancellation of options held by employees of Rofin.
21510_18_ITEM7_P12_S4	We funded the payment of the aggregate consideration with a combination of our available cash on hand and the proceeds from the Euro Term Loan described below.
21510_18_ITEM7_P12_S5	As a condition of the acquisition, we were required to divest and hold separate Rofin's low power CO 2 laser business based in Hull, United Kingdom (the "Hull Business"), and reported this business separately as a discontinued operation until its divestiture.
21510_18_ITEM7_P12_S6	We completed the divestiture of the Hull Business on October 11, 2017, after receiving approval for the terms of the sale from the European Commission.
21510_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	"Discontinued Operations and Sale of Assets Held for Sale" in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of this annual report for further discussion of the acquisition and divestiture, respectively.
21510_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	On November 7, 2016, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with Barclays Bank PLC ("Barclays"), Bank of America, N.A. ("BAML") and MUFG Union Bank, N.A. ("MUFG").
21510_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	The Credit Agreement provided for a 670.0 million Euro senior secured term loan facility (the "Euro Term Loan") and a $100.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility.
21510_18_ITEM7_P14_S2	On November 7, 2016, the Euro Term Loan was drawn in full and its proceeds were used to finance our acquisition of Rofin and pay related fees and expenses.
21510_18_ITEM7_P14_S3	Also, on November 7, 2016, we used 10.0 million Euros of the capacity under the revolving credit facility for the issuance of a letter of credit.
21510_18_ITEM7_P14_S4	On May 8, 2017, we entered into Amendment No. 1 and Waiver (the "Repricing Amendment") to the Credit Agreement.
21510_18_ITEM7_P14_S5	See Note 9, "Borrowings" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
21510_18_ITEM7_P14_S6	In relation to our acquisition of Rofin, we paid Barclays, our financial advisor, a fee of approximately $9.5 million , $1.0 million of which was paid upon delivery of the fairness opinion in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, and the remaining portion of which was paid upon consummation of the acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal 2017; these fees were recorded in selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations.
21510_18_ITEM7_P14_S7	We also paid Barclays, BAML and MUFG together approximately $17.0 million and $5.6 million for underwriting and upfront fees, respectively, upon the close of the financing on November 7, 2016; these fees are recorded as debt issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheets.
21510_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	As a result of our acquisition of Rofin in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we reorganized into two new reporting segments for the combined company based upon our organizational structure and how our Chief Operating Decision Maker receives and utilizes information provided to allocate resources and make decisions: OLS and ILS.
21510_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	This segmentation reflects the go-to-market strategies and synergies for our broad portfolio of laser technologies and products.
21510_18_ITEM7_P15_S2	While both segments deliver cost-effective, highly reliable photonics solutions, the OLS business segment, is focused on high performance laser sources and complex optical sub-systems, typically used in microelectronics manufacturing, medical diagnostics and therapeutic medical applications, as well as in scientific research.
21510_18_ITEM7_P15_S3	Our ILS business segment delivers high performance laser sources, sub-systems and tools primarily used for industrial laser materials processing, serving important end markets like automotive, machine tool, consumer goods and medical device manufacturing.
21510_18_ITEM7_P15_S4	Stock Repurchases On February 6, 2018 , our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $100.0 million of our common stock from time to time through January 31, 2019 .
21510_18_ITEM7_P15_S5	During fiscal 2018 , we repurchased and retired 574,946 shares of outstanding common stock under this program at an average price of $173.91 per share for a total of $100.0 million .
21510_18_ITEM7_P15_S6	On October 28, 2018 , our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $250.0 million of our common stock through December 31, 2019, with a limit of no more than $75.0 million per quarter.
21510_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FISCAL 2018 , 2017 AND 2016 Fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 consisted of 52 weeks.
21510_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	The following table sets forth, for the years indicated, the percentage of total net sales represented by the line items reflected in our consolidated statement of operations:
21510_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	Refer to Item 6 "Selected Financial Data" for a description of significant events that impacted the results of operations for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 .
21510_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	Backlog Backlog represents orders which we expect to be shipped within 12 months and the current portion of service contracts.
21510_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	Orders used to compute backlog are generally cancellable and, depending on the notice period, are subject to rescheduling by our customers without substantial penalties.
21510_18_ITEM7_P19_S2	We have not historically experienced a significant rate of cancellation or rescheduling, however the rate of cancellations or rescheduling may increase in the future.
21510_18_ITEM7_P19_S3	We had a backlog of orders shippable within 12 months of $759.9 million at September 29, 2018 , including a significant concentration in the flat panel display market ( 32% ) for customers which are primarily located in Asia.
21510_18_ITEM7_P19_S4	However, subsequent to year-end, one customer indicated its intent to cancel three purchase orders which included orders shippable within 12 months of $38.2 million and were included in backlog as of fiscal 2018 year-end.
21510_18_ITEM7_P19_S5	We reached agreement with this customer for compensation for such cancellation.
21510_18_ITEM7_P19_S6	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the amount of net sales and their relative percentages of total net sales by market application (dollars in thousands):
21510_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	During fiscal 2018 , net sales increased by $179.3 million , or 10% , compared to fiscal 2017 , with a significant increase in the microelectronics market and smaller increases in the OEM components and instrumentation, scientific and government programs and materials processing markets.
21510_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	In addition, net sales in fiscal 2018 include $9.2 million of sales from the acquisition of OR Laser after the March 8, 2018 acquisition date.
21510_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	Given that we began to experience market softening in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, particularly in China, we expect fiscal 2019 revenues to be 8% to 12% lower than fiscal 2018, with the second half of fiscal 2019 expected to be stronger than the first half of fiscal 2019.
21510_18_ITEM7_P21_S2	During fiscal 2018, Microelectronics sales increased $142.1 million , or 16% , compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher shipments related to ELA tools used in the flat panel display market including higher revenues from consumable parts as well as higher shipments related to semiconductor, advanced packaging and solar applications.
21510_18_ITEM7_P21_S3	In microelectronics, we expect that total flat panel display revenues, including both systems and services, will decrease approximately 15% to 20% in fiscal 2019 from fiscal 2018, although services revenue is expected to grow and is expected to partially offset the expected decrease in systems revenue.
21510_18_ITEM7_P21_S4	In addition, we have experienced and expect to experience some customer push outs and order cancellations over the next several quarters before the market begins to recover in fiscal 2020.
21510_18_ITEM7_P21_S5	We expect the fiscal 2020 recovery to be driven by additional investment in OLED capacity for consumer products.
21510_18_ITEM7_P21_S6	In semiconductor applications within the microelectronics market, we expect semiconductor capital equipment spending to decrease in fiscal 2019 as a result of decreased memory prices and the impact of trade tariffs, partially offset by strong service revenue.
21510_18_ITEM7_P21_S7	We also expect fiscal 2019 demand in advanced packaging applications to be similar to fiscal 2018 levels.
21510_18_ITEM7_P21_S8	Materials processing sales increased $9.0 million , or 2% , during fiscal 2018 primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of Rofin net sales in fiscal 2018, higher shipments for drilling and marking applications and the inclusion of seven months of OR Laser net sales.
21510_18_ITEM7_P21_S9	Market conditions in these markets began to noticeably erode in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
21510_18_ITEM7_P21_S10	This resulted in some Chinese customers pushing out or, to a lesser extent, cancelling orders.
21510_18_ITEM7_P21_S11	In addition, the Chinese market was also impacted by tariffs on U.S. goods and we experienced stronger price competition for fiber laser products in certain end markets.
21510_18_ITEM7_P21_S12	We expect these impacts to continue into fiscal 2019.
21510_18_ITEM7_P21_S13	The increase in the OEM components and instrumentation market of $17.7 million , or 9% , during fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher shipments for bio-instrumentation applications, which were partially offset by lower shipments for military applications.
21510_18_ITEM7_P21_S14	Within OEM components and instrumentation applications, we are seeing strong demand in the bio-instrumentation market, particularly in flow cytometry and sequencing applications, higher demand for consumables in the medical market, in dental applications and in eye disease management and strength in defense spending for directed-energy programs and in satellite optics.
21510_18_ITEM7_P21_S15	The increase in scientific and government programs market sales of $10.4 million , or 9% , during fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher demand for advanced research applications used by university and government research groups, particularly in Asia and the US.
21510_18_ITEM7_P21_S16	We expect demand in the scientific and government programs market to continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter.
21510_18_ITEM7_P21_S17	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, one of our German manufacturing sites, which we acquired as part of the Rofin acquisition, had a manufacturing parts shortage due to difficulties by operations/manufacturing personnel in using newly implemented Enterprise Management Systems.
21510_18_ITEM7_P21_S18	Unfortunately this shortage caused the site s inability to convert $6 million of inventory into shippable products.
21510_18_ITEM7_P21_S19	As a result not only were we unable to convert certain orders into revenue, we were required to use new rather than refurbished materials for service.
21510_18_ITEM7_P21_S20	We have taken various remedial actions to correct the situation, including changes in processes, responsibilities and personnel.
21510_18_ITEM7_P21_S21	We anticipate having these remedies completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
21510_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	During fiscal 2017 , net sales increased by $865.9 million , or 101% , compared to fiscal 2016 , with significant increases in the microelectronics and materials processing markets, a smaller increase in the OEM components and instrumentation market and a decrease in the scientific and government programs market.
21510_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	Net sales in fiscal 2017 included $434.9 million of Rofin net sales since the acquisition on November 7, 2016, primarily in the materials processing market.
21510_18_ITEM7_P22_S2	Microelectronics sales increased $439.3 million , or 97% , primarily due to higher shipments related to ELA tools used in the flat panel display market including higher revenues from consumable parts as well as higher shipments related to advanced packaging and semiconductor applications.
21510_18_ITEM7_P22_S3	Materials processing sales increased $387.9 million , or 313% , during fiscal 2017 primarily due to the addition of Rofin net sales and higher shipments for machine tools, automotive and other materials processing applications.
21510_18_ITEM7_P22_S4	The increase in the OEM components and instrumentation market of $41.5 million , or 26% , during fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher shipments for military, medical and bio-instrumentation applications, with much of the increase in military applications due to our acquisition of Rofin.
21510_18_ITEM7_P22_S5	The decrease in scientific and government programs market sales of $2.8 million , or 2% , during fiscal 2017 was primarily due to lower demand for advanced research applications used by university and government research groups in the U.S.
21510_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	conditions, our ability to manufacture these products and/or availability of critical component parts and supplies.
21510_18_ITEM7_P23_S1	As a result, the timing to convert orders for these products to net sales will likely fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter.
21510_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	We have historically generally experienced decreased revenue in the first fiscal quarter compared to other quarters in our fiscal year due to the impact of time off and business closures at our facilities and those of many of our customers due to year-end holidays.
21510_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	For example over the past 10 years, excluding certain recovery years, our first fiscal quarter revenues have ranged 2%-12% below the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal years.
21510_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	In fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , one customer accounted for 26% , 23% and 13% of net sales, respectively.
21510_18_ITEM7_P24_S3	In fiscal 2016, another customer accounted for 16% of net sales.
21510_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	Segments We are organized into two reportable operating segments: OLS and ILS.
21510_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	While both segments deliver cost-effective, highly reliable photonics solutions, OLS is focused on high performance laser sources and complex optical sub-systems, typically used in microelectronics manufacturing, medical diagnostics and therapeutic medical applications, as well as in scientific research.
21510_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	ILS delivers high performance laser sources, sub-systems and tools primarily used for industrial laser materials processing, serving important end markets like automotive, machine tool, consumer goods and medical device manufacturing.
21510_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the amount of net sales and their relative percentages of total net sales by segment (dollars in thousands):
21510_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	Net sales for fiscal 2018 increased $179.3 million , or 10% , compared to fiscal 2017 , with increases of $115.9 million , or 10% , in our OLS segment and increases of $63.4 million , or 11% , in our ILS segment.
21510_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	The fiscal 2018 increases in both OLS and ILS segment sales included increases due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
21510_18_ITEM7_P28_S2	Net sales for fiscal 2017 increased $865.9 million , or 101% , compared to fiscal 2016, with increases of $421.1 million , or 58% , in our OLS segment and increases of $444.8 million , or 330% , in our ILS segment.
21510_18_ITEM7_P28_S3	The impact of foreign exchange rates was not significant to fiscal 2017 sales in either segment.
21510_18_ITEM7_P28_S4	The increase in our OLS segment sales in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher shipments of ELA tools used in the flat panel display market and higher revenues from consumable parts as well as higher shipments for scientific and government programs, bio-instrumentation, semiconductor, solar and advanced packaging applications.
21510_18_ITEM7_P28_S5	These increases were partially offset by lower shipments for materials processing applications.
21510_18_ITEM7_P28_S6	The increase in our OLS segment sales in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher shipments of ELA tools used in the flat panel display market and higher revenues from consumable parts as well as higher shipments for semiconductor and advanced packaging applications.
21510_18_ITEM7_P28_S7	The increase in our ILS segment sales from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher shipments for microelectronics applications and materials processing applications including a full year of Rofin net sales and seven months of OR Laser net sales in fiscal 2018.
21510_18_ITEM7_P28_S8	The increase in our ILS segment sales from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher shipments for materials processing, microelectronics and OEM components and instrumentation applications due to our acquisition of Rofin ($429.2 million) as well as higher shipments to the medical, flat panel display and advanced packaging markets.
21510_18_ITEM7_P28_S9	Our gross profit percentage increased by 0.2% to 43.7% in fiscal 2018 from 43.5% in fiscal 2017 primarily due to the 1.5% favorable net impact of lower purchase accounting adjustments and lower restructuring costs (0.2%) compared to fiscal 2017 partially offset by the 1.5% unfavorable impact of higher product costs including higher warranty and installation costs and higher other costs.
21510_18_ITEM7_P28_S10	In fiscal 2017, we took a larger charge (1.5%) for amortization of inventory step-up related to our acquisition of Rofin compared to the charge in fiscal 2018 related to our acquisition of OR Laser.
21510_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	increase in gross profit percentage were lower restructuring charges (0.2%) for inventory write-offs, primarily in our ILS segment.
21510_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	This favorable net impact was partially offset by the impact from higher warranty events in both segments, with the largest impact from high power fiber lasers, unfavorable mix in the microelectronics market and unfavorable costs in certain materials processing markets partially offset by better leverage of manufacturing costs on higher volumes and favorable mix in certain materials processing markets.
21510_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	Our gross profit percentage decreased by 1.0% to 43.5% in fiscal 2017 from 44.5% in fiscal 2016 primarily due to the impact of purchase accounting adjustments (4.0%) for amortization of inventory step-up and amortization of intangibles related to our acquisition of Rofin in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
21510_18_ITEM7_P30_S1	Also contributing to the decrease was the impact of our acquisition of Rofin due to Rofin's margins that are lower than Coherent's historical margins (3.6% before considering purchase accounting adjustments).
21510_18_ITEM7_P30_S2	The decreases were partially offset by improvements in margins of Coherent historical products (6.6%) primarily due to the favorable leverage of manufacturing costs on higher volumes and favorable mix in flat panel display applications for both system sales and service, as well as the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, lower inventory provisions for excess and obsolete inventory, reduced freight costs and lower warranty costs as a percentage of sales due to the impact of significantly higher net sales.
21510_18_ITEM7_P30_S3	Our gross profit percentage has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors including market and product mix, pricing on volume orders, shipment volumes, our ability to manufacture advanced and more complex products, manufacturing efficiencies, excess and obsolete inventory write-downs, warranty costs, amortization of intangibles, pricing by competitors or suppliers, new product introductions, production volume, customization and reconfiguration of systems, commodity prices and foreign currency fluctuations, particularly the recent volatility of the Euro and a lesser extent, the Japanese Yen and South Korean Won.
21510_18_ITEM7_P30_S4	OEM Laser Sources Our OLS gross profit percentage decreased by 0.9% to 52.7% in fiscal 2018 from 53.6% in fiscal 2017 primarily due to unfavorable product margins (0.9%) and increased warranty and installation costs as a percentage of sales (0.3%) due to higher warranty events in the microelectronics and scientific and government programs markets, primarily in China, and higher installation costs for flat panel display applications.
21510_18_ITEM7_P30_S5	The unfavorable product margins were due to unfavorable mix within flat panel display applications for both systems and service as well as other microelectronics applications and the unfavorable impact of the stronger Euro and Won, all of which were partially offset by better leverage of manufacturing costs on higher volumes.
21510_18_ITEM7_P30_S6	These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by lower intangibles amortization (0.2%) as a percentage of sales and lower other costs (0.1%) due to lower inventory provisions for excess and obsolete inventory as a percentage of sales in certain business units and the impact of significantly higher sales.
21510_18_ITEM7_P30_S7	Our OLS gross profit percentage increased by 5.3% to 53.6% in fiscal 2017 from 48.3% in fiscal 2016 primarily due to favorable product margins (4.1%) as a result of favorable mix within flat panel display applications for both systems and service, favorable mix in other microelectronics and materials processing applications and higher leverage of manufacturing costs on higher volumes, as well as the favorable impact of the weaker Euro and stronger Yen and Won compared to fiscal 2016.
21510_18_ITEM7_P30_S8	Also contributing to the increase in gross profit percentage as a percentage of sales due to the impact of significantly higher sales volumes were lower other costs (0.7%) due to lower inventory provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and reduced freight and duty costs in certain business units, lower intangibles amortization (0.3%) and lower installation and warranty costs (0.2%).
21510_18_ITEM7_P30_S9	Our ILS gross profit percentage increased by 2.3% to 26.7% in fiscal 2018 from 24.4% in fiscal 2017 primarily due to 4.4% lower amortization of inventory step-up (4.5% in fiscal 2017 related to our acquisition of Rofin compared to 0.1% in fiscal 2018 related to our acquisition of OR Laser) as well as lower restructuring charges (0.7%) related to the implementation of planned restructuring activities in connection with the acquisition of Rofin, which were primarily related to the exit from our preexisting high power fiber laser product line net of higher service inventory write-offs.
21510_18_ITEM7_P30_S10	Partially offsetting the improvement, intangibles amortization increased as a percentage of sales (0.5%) due to the inclusion in fiscal 2018 of a full year of amortization for the Rofin acquisition and seven months of amortization related to the OR Laser acquisition.
21510_18_ITEM7_P30_S11	Excluding the 4.6% favorable net impact of lower purchase accounting adjustments and lower restructuring costs, gross profit percentage decreased 2.6% compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to unfavorable product margins including warranty costs (2.6%) as a percentage of sales.
21510_18_ITEM7_P30_S12	The unfavorable product margins were due to higher warranty events in materials processing applications, primarily high power fiber lasers, and the impact from unfavorable product costs in certain materials processing applications partially offset by the better leverage of manufacturing costs on higher volumes and favorable mix.
21510_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	acquisition of Rofin in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and restructuring costs (1.1%) related to the implementation of planned restructuring activities in connection with our acquisition of Rofin, which were primarily related to the exit from our preexisting high power fiber laser product line and other Rofin product lines.
21510_18_ITEM7_P31_S1	The decreases in gross profit percentage were partially offset by the favorable impact of Rofin's margins before considering purchase accounting adjustments.
21510_18_ITEM7_P31_S2	Rofin's high-power fiber laser and global tools businesses have higher margins than Coherent's legacy ILS businesses.
21510_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the amount of operating expenses and their relative percentages of total net sales by the line items reflected in our consolidated statement of operations (dollars in thousands):
21510_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	Research and development Fiscal 2018 research and development ("R D") expenses increased $13.4 million , or 11% , from fiscal 2017 , and increased slightly to 7.0% of sales, compared to 6.9% in fiscal 2017 .
21510_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	The increase was primarily due to $8.3 million higher spending on R D activities, the inclusion of a full year of Rofin R D expenses ($3.2 million) in fiscal 2018 and $1.4 million in incremental spending due to the acquisition of OR Laser in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
21510_18_ITEM7_P33_S2	The higher spending on R D activities includes higher spending on headcount and materials as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates (primarily the stronger Euro), which was partially offset by lower restructuring charges for our exit from our preexisting Coherent high power fiber laser product line in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
21510_18_ITEM7_P33_S3	On a segment basis, as compared to the prior year, OLS R D spending increased $6.5 million primarily due to higher net spending on R D activities including the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
21510_18_ITEM7_P33_S4	ILS R D spending increased $6.4 million primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of Rofin R D expenses, higher spending on R D activities including the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and the acquisition of OR Laser, which was partially offset by lower restructuring costs.
21510_18_ITEM7_P33_S5	Corporate and other R D spending increased $0.5 million primarily due to higher headcount spending in our Advanced Research Business unit.
21510_18_ITEM7_P33_S6	Fiscal 2017 R D expenses increased $37.4 million, or 46%, from fiscal 2016, but decreased to 6.9% of sales, compared to 9.5% in fiscal 2016.
21510_18_ITEM7_P33_S7	The increase in R D expenses was primarily due to the addition of Rofin R D expenses ($32.0 million, excluding $0.7 million of restructuring costs for severance) since the acquisition on November 7, 2016, $2.2 million higher project spending, including higher variable compensation and lower reimbursements from customers, and $2.1 million of restructuring costs related to the exit from our preexisting Coherent high power fiber laser product line in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
21510_18_ITEM7_P33_S8	There were also increases of $0.8 million for higher stock-based compensation expense including $0.4 million related to a charge recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 due to the acceleration of Rofin options and $0.3 million higher charges for increases in deferred compensation plan liabilities.
21510_18_ITEM7_P33_S9	On a segment basis, as compared to the prior year period, OLS R D spending increased $7.4 million primarily due to higher net spending on projects.
21510_18_ITEM7_P33_S10	ILS R D spending increased $27.7 million primarily due to our acquisition of Rofin and restructuring costs, partially offset by lower project spending.
21510_18_ITEM7_P33_S11	Corporate and other R D spending increased $2.3 million due to higher project spending in our advanced research business unit, higher stock-based compensation expense and higher charges for increases in deferred compensation plan liabilities.
21510_18_ITEM7_P33_S12	Selling, general and administrative Fiscal 2018 selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses increased $1.5 million , or 1% , from fiscal 2017 .
21510_18_ITEM7_P33_S13	A expenses ($8.0 million) in fiscal 2018 and $5.1 million higher other variable spending (including the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates) on consulting and infrastructure related to integration activities and in support of higher sales, which was partially offset by lower restructuring costs due to lower severance costs and a gain on the sale of a building in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
21510_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	expenses increased due to $2.4 million higher incremental spending from the acquisition of OR Laser in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, $1.2 million higher stock-based compensation expense, $1.1 million higher charges for increases in deferred compensation plan liabilities and $0.6 million higher payroll spending primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and higher spending on salaries, benefits and commissions net of lower variable compensation.
21510_18_ITEM7_P34_S1	The increase in stock-based compensation expense was due to higher expense for new grants offset by the $3.4 million charge recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 due to the acceleration of Rofin options.
21510_18_ITEM7_P34_S2	The increases were offset by $16.9 million lower financial advisory, consulting and legal costs related to acquisitions.
21510_18_ITEM7_P34_S3	On a segment basis, as compared to the prior year, OLS SG A expenses increased $7.1 million primarily due to higher payroll and other variable spending (including the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates) as well as spending relating to a historical Rofin business unit that is included in our OLS segment.
21510_18_ITEM7_P34_S4	ILS SG A spending increased $8.6 million primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of Rofin expenses, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, the acquisition of OR Laser and higher other variable spending partially offset by lower payroll spending including lower severance restructuring and variable compensation costs.
21510_18_ITEM7_P34_S5	Corporate and other SG A spending decreased $14.1 million primarily due to lower financial advisory, consulting and legal costs related to our acquisition of Rofin partially offset by higher stock-based compensation expense, higher charges for increases in deferred compensation plan liabilities and higher payroll spending including higher spending on benefits net of lower variable compensation.
21510_18_ITEM7_P34_S6	Fiscal 2017 SG A expenses increased $122.9 million, or 73%, from fiscal 2016.
21510_18_ITEM7_P34_S7	The increase was primarily due to the addition of Rofin SG A expenses ($75.2 million excluding $2.6 million restructuring costs for severance) following the acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, $15.5 million higher other spending on legal, consulting and infrastructure related to integration activities and the debt repricing as well as other variable spending in support of higher sales, $11.1 million higher payroll spending for variable compensation, commissions and salaries and benefits and $7.7 million higher financial advisory, consulting and legal costs related to our acquisition of Rofin.
21510_18_ITEM7_P34_S8	SG A expense also increased due to $8.6 million higher stock-based compensation expense, including $3.4 million related to a charge recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 due to the acceleration of Rofin options, as well as higher expense for new grants, $3.4 million of restructuring costs (primarily severance) and $1.4 million higher charges for increases in deferred compensation plan liabilities.
21510_18_ITEM7_P34_S9	On a segment basis, as compared to the prior year period, OLS SG A segment expenses increased $22.4 million primarily due to higher payroll and other variable spending as well as spending relating to a historical Rofin business unit which is included in our OLS segment.
21510_18_ITEM7_P34_S10	ILS SG A spending increased $74.3 million primarily due to our acquisition of Rofin ($78.7 million) and higher payroll and other variable spending.
21510_18_ITEM7_P34_S11	Corporate and other SG A spending increased $26.2 million primarily due to higher financial advisory, consulting and legal costs related to our acquisition of Rofin, higher stock-based compensation expense, higher charges for increases in deferred compensation plan liabilities and higher payroll spending.
21510_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	Gain on business combination On November 7, 2016, we acquired Rofin at a price of $32.50 per share of Rofin common stock (See Note 3, "Business Combinations" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).
21510_18_ITEM7_P35_S1	We recognized a gain of $5.4 million in our consolidated statements of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 on the increase in fair value from the date of purchase for the shares of Rofin we owned prior to the acquisition.
21510_18_ITEM7_P35_S2	Impairment and other charges In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, management decided to sell several entities that we acquired in the Rofin acquisition.
21510_18_ITEM7_P35_S3	Although the sale was not completed as of the end of fiscal 2017, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $2.9 million to operating expense in our results of operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 to reduce our carrying value in these entities to fair value.
21510_18_ITEM7_P35_S4	We completed the sale of these entities on April 27, 2018.
21510_18_ITEM7_P35_S5	In fiscal 2018, we recorded additional charges of $0.3 million related to the impairment and sale of these entities.
21510_18_ITEM7_P35_S6	See Note 18, "Discontinued Operations and Sale of Assets Held for Sale" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
21510_18_ITEM7_P35_S7	In addition, in fiscal 2018, we recorded impairment charges of $0.5 million to reduce the carrying value of a building to its fair value.
21510_18_ITEM7_P35_S8	Amortization of intangible assets Amortization of intangible assets decreased $5.3 million , or 33% , from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 primarily due to the completion of the amortization of backlog intangibles from our acquisition of Rofin in fiscal 2017 ($5.5 million lower), which was partially offset by the inclusion of a full year of Rofin amortization expenses in fiscal 2018, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and amortization of intangibles related to our acquisition of OR Laser in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
21510_18_ITEM7_P35_S9	Amortization of intangible assets increased $13.2 million, or 464%, from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017 primarily due to our acquisition of Rofin in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
21510_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	Other income (expense), net, changed by $8.0 million to other expense of $31.5 million in fiscal 2018 from other expense of $23.4 million in fiscal 2017 .
21510_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	The higher expenses were primarily due to $15.9 million lower foreign exchange net gains (higher net losses) resulting primarily from a gain in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 of $11.3 million on forward contracts associated with our foreign exchange risk related to the commitment and issuance of our Euro Term Loan to finance the acquisition of Rofin, the impact of changing rates on cash conversions and higher points on forward contracts due to higher hedge volumes.
21510_18_ITEM7_P36_S2	The lower foreign exchange gains were offset by $8.5 million lower interest expense due to lower interest on the Euro Term Loan resulting from our paydown of principal and an interest rate reduction, which were partially offset by higher amortization of debt issuance costs related to the Euro Term loan.
21510_18_ITEM7_P36_S3	Other income (expense), net, changed by $18.7 million to other expense of $23.4 million in fiscal 2017 from other expense of $4.7 million in fiscal 2016.
21510_18_ITEM7_P36_S4	The higher expenses were primarily due to higher interest expense of $33.0 million partially offset by $11.0 million higher foreign exchange gains and $3.2 million higher gains, net of expenses, on our deferred compensation plan assets, including a death benefit of $1.3 million.
21510_18_ITEM7_P36_S5	Interest expense increased due to interest on the Euro Term Loan and interest on the commitment of the Euro Term Loan to fund our acquisition of Rofin as well as amortization of debt issuance costs related to the Euro Term Loan.
21510_18_ITEM7_P36_S6	The higher foreign exchange gains were primarily due to a gain of $11.3 million on forward contracts associated with our foreign exchange risk related to the commitment of our Euro Term Loan and the issuance of the Euro Term Loan to finance our acquisition of Rofin partially offset by the impact of changing rates on cash conversions.
21510_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	Income taxes On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act") was enacted.
21510_18_ITEM7_P37_S1	The Tax Act changes are broad and complex.
21510_18_ITEM7_P37_S2	The final impact of the Tax Act may materially differ from the provisional estimates provided.
21510_18_ITEM7_P37_S3	Among other things, this may be due to changes in interpretations of the Tax Act, any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the Tax Act and any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the Tax Act.
21510_18_ITEM7_P37_S4	Additionally, long-standing international tax policies that determine each country s jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are evolving as a result of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting reporting requirements ("BEPS") recommended by the G8, G20 and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ("OECD").
21510_18_ITEM7_P37_S5	As these and other tax laws and related regulations change, our financial results could prospectively be materially impacted.
21510_18_ITEM7_P37_S6	Given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency, it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow.
21510_18_ITEM7_P37_S7	Such changes could, however, adversely impact our financial results.
21510_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	As discussed in Note 15, "Income Taxes" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Tax Act resulted in a provisional charge of $26.7 million for the year ended September 29, 2018.
21510_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	This is comprised of an estimated deemed repatriation tax charge of $17.8 million less a previously recorded deferred tax liability of $20.3 million for anticipated repatriation of our investment in a foreign subsidiary, plus an estimated deferred tax remeasurement charge of $15.5 million and an accrual for foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes of $13.7 million on certain foreign earnings not considered permanently reinvested.
21510_18_ITEM7_P38_S2	The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations before income taxes for fiscal 2018 of 31.6% was higher than the effective U.S. federal blended tax rate of 24.5% primarily due to the Tax Act's one-time mandatory deemed repatriation transition tax, the impact of income subject to foreign tax rates that are higher than the U.S. tax rates, the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the newly enacted U.S. federal tax rate of 21.0%, an accrual for foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes on certain foreign earnings not considered permanently reinvested, stock-based compensation not deductible for tax purposes and limitations on the deductibility of compensation under Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") Section 162(m).
21510_18_ITEM7_P38_S3	These amounts are partially offset by the excess tax benefits from stock award exercises and restricted stock unit vesting, the benefit of foreign tax credits, the benefit of federal research and development tax credits, the benefit of a domestic manufacturing deduction under IRC Section 199 and the Singapore tax exemption.
21510_18_ITEM7_P38_S4	As a result of the adoption of the new accounting standard on share-based compensation in fiscal 2018, our effective tax rate will increase or decrease based upon the tax effect of the difference between the share-based compensation expenses and the benefits taken on the Company's tax returns.
21510_18_ITEM7_P38_S5	We recognize excess tax benefits on a discrete basis and therefore anticipate the effective tax rate to vary from quarter to quarter depending on our share price in each period.
21510_18_ITEM7_P38_S6	The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations before income taxes for fiscal 2017 of 30.9% was lower than the statutory rate of 35.0%.
21510_18_ITEM7_P38_S7	This was primarily due to differences related to the benefit of income subject to foreign tax rates that are lower than U.S. tax rates including the Singapore tax exemption, the benefit of foreign tax credits and federal research and development tax credits, the benefit of a domestic manufacturing deduction under IRC Section 199 and the release of certain tax reserves due to audit settlement.
21510_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	purposes, tax costs of Rofin restructuring, ASC 740-10 (formerly FIN48) tax liabilities for transfer pricing, stock-based compensation not deductible for tax purposes and limitations on the deductibility of compensation under IRC Section 162(m).
21510_18_ITEM7_P39_S1	The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations before income taxes for fiscal 2016 of 28.8% was lower than the statutory rate of 35.0%.
21510_18_ITEM7_P39_S2	This was primarily due to differences related to the benefit of income subject to foreign tax rates that are lower than U.S. tax rates including the Singapore tax exemption, the benefit of foreign tax credits and the benefit of federal research and development tax credits including renewal of the federal research and development tax credits for fiscal 2015.
21510_18_ITEM7_P39_S3	These amounts are partially offset by deemed dividend inclusions under the Subpart F tax rules, stock-based compensation not deductible for tax purposes and limitations on the deductibility of compensation under IRC Section 162(m).
21510_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	In October 2016, Coherent Singapore received an amended Pioneer Status tax exemption from the Singapore authorities effective from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2021.
21510_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	The tax holiday continues to be conditional upon our meeting certain revenue, business spending and employment thresholds.
21510_18_ITEM7_P40_S2	The impact of this tax exemption decreased Singapore income taxes by approximately $2.5 million, $1.1 million and $0.7 million in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
21510_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity and capital resources At September 29, 2018 , we had assets classified as cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, in an aggregate amount of $310.6 million , compared to $475.6 million at September 30, 2017 .
21510_18_ITEM7_P41_S1	This decrease was primarily due to the paydown of debt of $173.3 million and the repurchase of $100.0 million of our common stock in fiscal 2018.
21510_18_ITEM7_P41_S2	In addition, at September 29, 2018 , we had $13.6 million of restricted cash.
21510_18_ITEM7_P41_S3	At September 29, 2018 , approximately $215.7 million of our cash and securities was held in certain of our foreign subsidiaries and branches, $191.2 million of which was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
21510_18_ITEM7_P41_S4	At September 29, 2018 , we had approximately $214.9 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries including certain entities where we intend to permanently reinvest our accumulated earnings and our current plans do not demonstrate a need for these funds to support our domestic operations.
21510_18_ITEM7_P41_S5	If, however, a portion of these funds are needed for and distributed to our operations in the United States, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and certain state taxes.
21510_18_ITEM7_P41_S6	The amount of the U.S. and foreign taxes due would depend on the amount and manner of repatriation, as well as the location from where the funds are repatriated.
21510_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	We historically asserted our intention to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings.
21510_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	However, we have reevaluated our historic assertion as a result of the enactment of the Tax Act and no longer consider certain historic foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries.
21510_18_ITEM7_P42_S2	We actively monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold these assets, primarily focusing on the safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield on these assets.
21510_18_ITEM7_P42_S3	We diversify our cash and cash equivalents and investments among various financial institutions, money market funds, sovereign debt and other securities in order to reduce our exposure should any one of these financial institutions or financial instruments fail or encounter difficulties.
21510_18_ITEM7_P42_S4	To date, we have not experienced any material loss or lack of access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments.
21510_18_ITEM7_P42_S5	However, we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets.
21510_18_ITEM7_P42_S6	See ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK below for more information about risks and trends related to foreign currencies.
21510_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	Sources and Uses of Cash Historically, our primary source of cash has been provided by operations.
21510_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	Other sources of cash in the past three fiscal years include proceeds from our Euro Term Loan used to finance our acquisition of Rofin, proceeds received from the sale of our stock through our employee stock purchase plan as well as borrowings under our domestic line of credit.
21510_18_ITEM7_P43_S2	Our historical uses of cash have primarily been for acquisitions of businesses and technologies, the repurchase of our common stock, capital expenditures and debt issuance costs.
21510_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $148.0 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and increased by $278.8 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 .
21510_18_ITEM7_P44_S1	The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to lower cash flows from deferred revenue, income taxes payable and payroll accruals as well as the timing of shipments of large systems, which were partially offset by higher net income and higher cash flows due to non-cash expenses for amortization, stock-based compensation and depreciation.
21510_18_ITEM7_P44_S2	The increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher net income, higher cash flows due to higher non-cash expenses for amortization, stock-based compensation and depreciation, higher income taxes payable, higher deferred revenue and higher cash flows from the timing of shipments of large systems from inventory partially offset by lower cash flows from accounts receivable.
21510_18_ITEM7_P44_S3	We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short term investments combined with cash to be provided by operating activities and amounts available under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to cover our working capital needs and planned capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months to the extent such items are known or are reasonably determinable based on current business and market conditions.
21510_18_ITEM7_P44_S4	However, we may elect to finance certain of our capital expenditure requirements through other sources of capital.
21510_18_ITEM7_P44_S5	We continue to follow our strategy to further strengthen our financial position by using available cash flow to fund operations.
21510_18_ITEM7_P44_S6	We intend to continue to consider acquisition opportunities at valuations we believe are reasonable based upon market conditions.
21510_18_ITEM7_P44_S7	However, we cannot accurately predict the timing, size and success of our acquisition efforts or our associated potential capital commitments.
21510_18_ITEM7_P44_S8	Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire businesses on terms acceptable to us.
21510_18_ITEM7_P44_S9	We expect to fund future acquisitions, if any, through additional borrowings (as in our acquisition of Rofin), existing cash balances and cash flows from operations (as in our acquisition of OR Laser).
21510_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	If required, we will consider the issuance of securities.
21510_18_ITEM7_P45_S1	The extent to which we will be willing or able to use our common stock to make acquisitions will depend on its market value at the time and the willingness of potential sellers to accept it as full or partial payment.
21510_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	On November 7, 2016, we entered into a Credit Agreement with Barclays, as administrative agent and an L/C Issuer, BAML as an L/C Issuer, and MUFG as an L/C Issuer (the "Credit Agreement") that provided for a 670.0 million Euro senior secured term loan facility (the "Euro Term Loan") and a $100.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility ("Revolving Credit Facility") with a $30.0 million letter of credit sublimit and a $10.0 million swing line sublimit.
21510_18_ITEM7_P46_S1	We borrowed the full 670.0 million Euros under the Euro Term Loan and its proceeds were used to finance our acquisition of Rofin and pay related fees and expenses.
21510_18_ITEM7_P46_S2	On November 7, 2016, we also used 10.0 million Euros of the capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility for the issuance of a letter of credit.
21510_18_ITEM7_P46_S3	We were in compliance with all covenants at September 29, 2018 .
21510_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	See Note 9, "Borrowings" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
21510_18_ITEM7_P47_S1	The aggregate consideration paid by us to the former Rofin stockholders in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was approximately $904.5 million, excluding related transaction fees and expenses.
21510_18_ITEM7_P47_S2	We also paid $15.3 million due to the cancellation of options held by employees of Rofin.
21510_18_ITEM7_P47_S3	We incurred approximately $26.4 million of debt issuance costs in fiscal 2017.
21510_18_ITEM7_P47_S4	In fiscal 2017, we made debt principal payments $178.1 million, including voluntary prepayments of $170.7 million, recorded interest expense on the Euro Term Loan of $23.5 million, recorded $7.2 million amortization of debt issuance costs and recorded interest expense of $2.7 million for the commitment of the Euro Term Loan.
21510_18_ITEM7_P47_S5	In fiscal 2018, we made debt principal payments $170.1 million, including voluntary prepayments of $162.1 million, recorded interest expense on the Euro Term Loan of $14.9 million and recorded $9.6 million amortization of debt issuance costs.
21510_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	of which was paid upon consummation of the acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal 2017; these fees were recorded as SG A expense.
21510_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	On March 8, 2018, we acquired privately held OR Laser for approximately $47.4 million, excluding transaction costs.
21510_18_ITEM7_P48_S2	On April 27, 2018, we completed the sale of several entities that we acquired in the Rofin acquisition for approximately $6.3 million.
21510_18_ITEM7_P48_S3	On February 6, 2018, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $100.0 million of our common stock from time to time through January 31, 2019.
21510_18_ITEM7_P48_S4	During fiscal 2018, we repurchased and retired 574,946 shares of outstanding common stock under this program at an average price of $173.91 per share for a total of $100.0 million.
21510_18_ITEM7_P48_S5	See Note 12, "Stock Repurchases" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
21510_18_ITEM7_P48_S6	On October 28, 2018 , our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $250.0 million of our common stock through December 31, 2019, with a limit of no more than $75.0 million per quarter.
21510_18_ITEM7_P48_S7	See Note 11, "Stock Repurchases" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
21510_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	On October 5, 2018 , we completed two small acquisitions totaling approximately $19.0 million.
21510_18_ITEM7_P49_S1	See Note 19, "Subsequent Events" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
21510_18_ITEM7_P49_S2	Additional sources of cash available to us were international currency lines of credit and bank credit facilities totaling $26.5 million as of September 29, 2018 , of which $18.5 million was unused and available.
21510_18_ITEM7_P49_S3	These unsecured international credit facilities were used in Europe and Japan during fiscal 2018.
21510_18_ITEM7_P49_S4	As of September 29, 2018 , we had utilized $8.0 million of the international credit facilities as guarantees in Europe.
21510_18_ITEM7_P49_S5	Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities increased to 3.3 :1 at September 29, 2018 compared to 3.1 :1 at September 30, 2017 .
21510_18_ITEM7_P49_S6	The increase in our ratio was primarily due to lower deferred income and higher inventories, which were partially offset by lower cash and cash equivalents.
21510_18_ITEM7_P49_S7	Our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and working capital are as follows (in thousands):
21510_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933.
21510_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	The following summarizes our contractual obligations at September 29, 2018 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):
21510_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	Because of the uncertainty as to the timing of such payments, we have excluded cash payments related to our contractual obligations for our deferred compensation plans aggregating $41.7 million at September 29, 2018 .
21510_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	As of September 29, 2018 , we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $70.3 million which includes penalties and interest of $4.4 million .
21510_18_ITEM7_P51_S2	Approximately $36.3 million has been recorded as a noncurrent liability.
21510_18_ITEM7_P51_S3	At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table.
21510_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	Changes in financial condition Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018 was $236.1 million , which included net income of $247.4 million , depreciation and amortization of $122.9 million , stock-based compensation expense of $32.7 million and net decreases in deferred tax assets of $16.6 million , partially offset by cash used by operating assets and liabilities of $187.1 million (primarily increases in inventories, increases in accounts receivable, decreases in deferred income and decreases in accrued payroll).
21510_18_ITEM7_P52_S1	Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017 was $384.1 million, which included net income of $207.1 million, depreciation and amortization of $111.4 million, cash provided by operating assets and liabilities of $54.8 million (primarily increases in taxes payable, deferred income and accounts payable net of increases in accounts receivable and inventories) and stock-based compensation expense of $26.3 million, partially offset by increases in net deferred tax assets of $19.8 million.
21510_18_ITEM7_P52_S2	Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2018 was $67.7 million , which included $86.4 million , net of proceeds from dispositions, used to acquire property and equipment and to purchase and upgrade buildings and $45.4 million net of cash acquired to purchase OR Laser partially offset by $32.3 million net sales of available-for-sale securities, $25.0 million proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations and $6.3 million proceeds from the sale of other entities.
21510_18_ITEM7_P52_S3	Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2017 of $810.3 million included $740.5 million net of cash acquired to purchase Rofin, $61.8 million, net of proceeds from dispositions, used to acquire property and equipment and to purchase and upgrade buildings and $7.2 million net purchases of available-for-sale securities.
21510_18_ITEM7_P52_S4	Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2018 was $299.0 million , which included $173.3 million net debt payments, $100.0 million repurchases of our common stock and $36.3 million outflows due to net settlement of restricted stock units partially offset by $10.6 million generated from our employee purchase plans.
21510_18_ITEM7_P52_S5	Cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2017 was $506.0 million, which included $539.1 million net borrowings and $8.1 million generated from our employee purchase plans partially offset by $26.4 million of debt issuance costs and $15.7 million outflows due to net settlement of restricted stock units.
21510_18_ITEM7_P52_S6	Changes in exchange rates in fiscal 2018 resulted in a decrease in cash balances of $2.4 million .
21510_18_ITEM7_P52_S7	Changes in exchange rates in fiscal 2017 resulted in an increase in cash balances of $22.9 million.
21510_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the respective dates of adoption or expected adoption and effects on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
21510_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.
21510_18_ITEM7_P54_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
21510_18_ITEM7_P54_S2	We have identified the following as the items that require the most significant judgment and often involve complex estimation: revenue recognition, business combinations, accounting for long-lived assets (including goodwill and intangible assets), inventory valuation, warranty reserves and accounting for income taxes.
21510_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered or the service has been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable.
21510_18_ITEM7_P55_S1	Revenue from product sales is recorded when all of the foregoing conditions are met and risk of loss and title passes to the customer.
21510_18_ITEM7_P55_S2	Our products typically include a warranty and the estimated cost of product warranty claims (based on historical experience) is recorded at the time the sale is recognized.
21510_18_ITEM7_P55_S3	Sales to customers are generally not subject to any price protection or return rights.
21510_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	The majority of our sales are made to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), distributors, representatives and end-users in the non-scientific market.
21510_18_ITEM7_P56_S1	Sales made to these customers do not require installation of the products by us and are not subject to other post-delivery obligations, except in occasional instances where we have agreed to perform installation or provide training.
21510_18_ITEM7_P56_S2	In those instances, we defer revenue related to installation services or training until these services have been rendered.
21510_18_ITEM7_P56_S3	We allocate revenue from multiple element arrangements to the various elements based upon fair values or a selling price hierarchy, as more fully described in Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition," in our consolidated financial statements.
21510_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	Should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions, revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected.
21510_18_ITEM7_P57_S1	Failure to obtain anticipated orders due to delays or cancellations of orders could have a material adverse effect on our revenue.
21510_18_ITEM7_P57_S2	In addition, pressures from customers to reduce our prices or to modify our existing sales terms may have a material adverse effect on our revenue in future periods.
21510_18_ITEM7_P57_S3	Our sales to distributors, representatives and end-user customers typically do not have customer acceptance provisions and only certain of our sales to OEM customers and integrators have customer acceptance provisions.
21510_18_ITEM7_P57_S4	Customer acceptance is generally limited to performance under our published product specifications.
21510_18_ITEM7_P57_S5	For the few product sales that have customer acceptance provisions because of higher than published specifications, (1) the products are tested and accepted by the customer at our site or the customer accepts the results of our testing program prior to shipment to the customer, or (2) the revenue is deferred until customer acceptance occurs.
21510_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	Sales to end-users in the scientific market typically require installation and, thus, involve post-delivery obligations; however our post-delivery installation obligations are not essential to the functionality of our products.
21510_18_ITEM7_P58_S1	We defer revenue related to installation services until completion of these services.
21510_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	For most products, training is not provided; therefore, no post-delivery training obligation exists.
21510_18_ITEM7_P59_S1	However, when training is provided to our customers, it is typically priced separately and recognized as revenue as these services are provided.
21510_18_ITEM7_P59_S2	For multiple element arrangements which include extended maintenance contracts, we allocate and defer the amount of consideration equal to the separately stated price and recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
21510_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	We include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the respective dates of acquisition.
21510_18_ITEM7_P60_S1	We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our business acquisitions to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, based on their estimated fair values.
21510_18_ITEM7_P60_S2	The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.
21510_18_ITEM7_P60_S3	Additional information existing as of the acquisition date, but unknown to us at that time, may become known during the remainder of the measurement period, not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date, which may result in changes to the amounts and allocations recorded.
21510_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill We evaluate long-lived assets and amortizable intangible assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances or our planned use of assets indicate that their carrying amounts may not be fully recoverable or that their useful lives are no longer appropriate.
21510_18_ITEM7_P61_S1	Reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying values of the assets are impaired based on comparison to the undiscounted expected future cash flows identifiable to such long-lived and amortizable intangible assets.
21510_18_ITEM7_P61_S2	If the comparison indicates that impairment exists, the impaired asset is written down to its fair value.
21510_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	We have determined that our reporting units are the same as our operating segments as each constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results.
21510_18_ITEM7_P62_S1	We make this determination in a manner consistent with how the operating segments are managed.
21510_18_ITEM7_P62_S2	Based on this analysis, we have identified two reporting units which are our reportable segments: OLS and ILS.
21510_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and written down when impaired (See Note 7, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).
21510_18_ITEM7_P63_S1	We generally perform our annual impairment tests during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter, with any resulting impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.
21510_18_ITEM7_P63_S2	In January 2017, the FASB issued amended guidance that simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.
21510_18_ITEM7_P63_S3	Under the amendments in this update, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value.
21510_18_ITEM7_P63_S4	The new standard will become effective for our fiscal year beginning October 2, 2021.
21510_18_ITEM7_P63_S5	We elected to early adopt the standard in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 for our fiscal 2017 impairment tests.
21510_18_ITEM7_P63_S6	In fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, we conducted a qualitative assessment of the goodwill in the OLS reporting unit during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount.
21510_18_ITEM7_P63_S7	In assessing the qualitative factors, we considered the impact of these key factors: macroeconomic conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency, market and industry conditions, our operating and competitive environment, regulatory and political developments, the overall financial performance of our reporting units including cost factors and budgeted-to-actual revenue results.
21510_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	value and the carrying value of OLS.
21510_18_ITEM7_P64_S1	Based on our assessment, goodwill in the OLS reporting unit was not impaired as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016.
21510_18_ITEM7_P64_S2	As such, it was not necessary to perform the goodwill impairment test at that time in any of those fiscal years.
21510_18_ITEM7_P64_S3	In fiscal 2018, we conducted a qualitative assessment of the goodwill in the ILS reporting unit during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount.
21510_18_ITEM7_P64_S4	In assessing the qualitative factors, we considered the impact of these key factors: macroeconomic conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency, market and industry conditions, our operating and competitive environment, regulatory and political developments, the overall financial performance of our reporting units including cost factors and budgeted-to-actual revenue results.
21510_18_ITEM7_P64_S5	We also considered our market capitalization, stock price performance and the significant excess calculated in the prior year between estimated fair value and the carrying value of ILS.
21510_18_ITEM7_P64_S6	Based on our assessment, goodwill in the ILS reporting unit was not impaired as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and as such, it was not necessary to perform the goodwill impairment test at that time.
21510_18_ITEM7_P64_S7	For our ILS reporting unit, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment in fiscal 2017 and 2016 and proceeded directly to performing the first step of goodwill impairment.
21510_18_ITEM7_P64_S8	Accordingly, we performed the Step 1 test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and 2016.
21510_18_ITEM7_P64_S9	We determined the fair value of the reporting unit for the Step 1 test using a 50-50% weighting of the Income (discounted cash flow) approach and Market (market comparable) approach.
21510_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	The Income approach utilizes the discounted cash flow model to provide an estimation of fair value based on the cash flows that a business expects to generate.
21510_18_ITEM7_P65_S1	These cash flows are based on forecasts developed internally by management which are then discounted at an after tax rate of return required by equity and debt market participants of a business enterprise.
21510_18_ITEM7_P65_S2	This rate of return or cost of capital is weighted based on the capitalization of comparable companies.
21510_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	The Market approach determines fair value by comparing the reporting units to comparable companies in similar lines of business that are publicly traded.
21510_18_ITEM7_P66_S1	Total Enterprise Value (TEV) multiples such as TEV to revenues and TEV to earnings (if applicable) before interest and taxes of the publicly traded companies are calculated.
21510_18_ITEM7_P66_S2	These multiples are then applied to the reporting unit's operating results to obtain an estimate of fair value.
21510_18_ITEM7_P66_S3	Each of these two approaches captures aspects of value in each reporting unit.
21510_18_ITEM7_P66_S4	The Income approach captures our expected future performance, and the Market approach captures how investors view the reporting units through other competitors.
21510_18_ITEM7_P66_S5	We believe these valuation approaches are proven valuation techniques and methodologies for our industry and are widely accepted by investors.
21510_18_ITEM7_P66_S6	As neither was perceived by us to deliver any greater indication of value than the other, and neither approach individually computed a fair value less than the carrying value of the segment, we weighted each of the approaches equally.
21510_18_ITEM7_P66_S7	Management completed and reviewed the results of the Step 1 analysis and concluded that an impairment charge was not required as the estimated fair value of the ILS reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value.
21510_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	At September 29, 2018 , we had $442.9 million of goodwill ( $100.7 million OLS and $342.2 million in ILS), $142.3 million of purchased intangible assets and $311.8 million of property and equipment on our consolidated balance sheet.
21510_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	Inventory Valuation We record our inventory at the lower of cost (computed on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value.
21510_18_ITEM7_P68_S1	We write-down our inventory to its estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
21510_18_ITEM7_P68_S2	Inventory write-downs are generally recorded within guidelines set by management when the inventory for a device exceeds 12 months of its demand or when management has deemed parts are no longer active or useful.
21510_18_ITEM7_P68_S3	If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required which could materially affect our future results of operations.
21510_18_ITEM7_P68_S4	Due to rapidly changing forecasts and orders, additional write-downs for excess or obsolete inventory, while not currently expected, could be required in the future.
21510_18_ITEM7_P68_S5	In the event that alternative future uses of fully written down inventories are identified, we may experience better than normal profit margins when such inventory is sold.
21510_18_ITEM7_P68_S6	Differences between actual results and previous estimates of excess and obsolete inventory could materially affect our future results of operations.
21510_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	We write-down our demo inventory by amortizing the cost of demo inventory over periods ranging from 24 to 36 months after such inventory is placed in service.
21510_18_ITEM7_P69_S1	We provide warranties on the majority of our product sales and allowances for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale.
21510_18_ITEM7_P69_S2	The determination of such allowances requires us to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty.
21510_18_ITEM7_P69_S3	We currently establish warranty reserves based on historical warranty costs for each product line.
21510_18_ITEM7_P69_S4	The weighted average warranty period covered is approximately 15 months.
21510_18_ITEM7_P69_S5	If actual return rates and/or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates, adjustments to cost of sales may be required in future periods.
21510_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income tax provision (benefit) in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
21510_18_ITEM7_P70_S1	This process involves us estimating our current income tax provision (benefit) together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
21510_18_ITEM7_P70_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets.
21510_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized.
21510_18_ITEM7_P71_S1	While we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made.
21510_18_ITEM7_P71_S2	Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.
21510_18_ITEM7_P71_S3	During fiscal 2018, we increased our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by $5.0 million to $33.7 million, primarily due to the increase in California research and development tax credits and net operating losses generated from Rofin China which are not expected to be recognized.
21510_18_ITEM7_P71_S4	The Company had U.S. federal deferred tax assets related to research and development credits and other tax attributes that can be used to offset federal taxable income in future periods.
21510_18_ITEM7_P71_S5	These credit carryforwards will expire if they are not used within certain time periods.
21510_18_ITEM7_P71_S6	As of September 29, 2018, management determined that there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not sufficient taxable income will exist in the future allowing us to recognize these deferred tax assets.
21510_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	We historically asserted our intention to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings.
21510_18_ITEM7_P72_S1	However, we have reevaluated our historic assertion as a result of the enactment of the Tax Act and no longer consider certain historic foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries.
21510_18_ITEM7_P72_S2	As a result of this change in assertion, we recorded a $13.7 million tax expense for foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
21510_18_ITEM7_P72_S3	We will continue to assert an indefinite reinvestment of certain historic foreign earnings and profits of $488.0 million and may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and certain state income taxes upon repatriation.
21510_18_ITEM7_P72_S4	We also have not recognized any deferred taxes for outside basis differences in our foreign subsidiaries.
21510_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
21510_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
21510_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Interest rate sensitivity A portion of our investment portfolio is composed of fixed income securities.
21510_18_ITEM7A_P1_S1	These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase.
21510_18_ITEM7A_P1_S2	If interest rates were to increase immediately (whether due to changes in overall market rates or credit worthiness of the issuers of our individual securities) and uniformly by 10% from levels at fiscal 2018 year-end, the fair value of the portfolio, based on quoted market prices in active markets involving similar assets, would decline by an immaterial amount due to their short-term maturities.
21510_18_ITEM7A_P1_S3	We have the ability to generally hold our fixed income investments until maturity and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio.
21510_18_ITEM7A_P1_S4	If necessary, we may sell short-term investments prior to maturity to meet our liquidity needs.
21510_18_ITEM7A_P1_S5	At fiscal 2018 year-end, the fair value of our available-for-sale debt securities was $0.1 million , all of which was classified as short-term investments.
21510_18_ITEM7A_P1_S6	At fiscal 2017 year-end, the fair value of our available-for-sale debt securities was $69.5 million , $37.0 million of which was classified as cash and cash equivalents and $32.5 million of which was classified as short-term investments.
21510_18_ITEM7A_P1_S7	There were no gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities at fiscal 2018 or 2017 year-end.
21510_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates related to our Euro Term Loan.
21510_18_ITEM7A_P2_S1	As of September 29, 2018 , we owed $430.6 million on this loan with an interest rate of 2.75% .
21510_18_ITEM7A_P2_S2	We performed a sensitivity analysis on the outstanding portion of our debt obligation as of September 29, 2018 .
21510_18_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Should the current average interest rate increase or decrease by 10%, the resulting annual increase or decrease to interest expense would be approximately $1.2 million as of September 29, 2018 .
21510_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We maintain operations in various countries outside of the United States and have foreign subsidiaries that manufacture and sell our products in various global markets.
21510_18_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The majority of our sales are transacted in U.S. dollars.
21510_18_ITEM7A_P3_S2	However, we do generate revenues in other currencies, primarily the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the South Korean Won and the Chinese Renminbi.
21510_18_ITEM7A_P3_S3	Additionally, we have operations in different countries around the world with costs incurred in the foregoing currencies and other local currencies, such as British Pound Sterling, Singapore Dollars, Malaysian Ringgit, Swiss Franc and Canadian Dollar.
21510_18_ITEM7A_P3_S4	As a result, our earnings, cash flows and cash balances are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
21510_18_ITEM7A_P3_S5	For example, because of our significant manufacturing operations in Europe, a weakening Euro is advantageous and a strengthening Euro is disadvantageous to our financial results.
21510_18_ITEM7A_P3_S6	We attempt to limit these exposures through financial market instruments.
21510_18_ITEM7A_P3_S7	We utilize derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts with maturities of two months or less, to manage our exposure associated with anticipated cash flows and net asset and liability positions denominated in foreign currencies.
21510_18_ITEM7A_P3_S8	Gains and losses on the forward contracts are mitigated by gains and losses on the underlying instruments.
21510_18_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
21510_18_ITEM7A_P4_S1	On occasion, we enter into currency forward exchange contracts to hedge specific anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions generally expected to occur within the next 12 months.
21510_18_ITEM7A_P4_S2	These cash flow hedges are designated for hedge accounting treatment and gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholder's equity and reclassified into earnings at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized in earnings.
21510_18_ITEM7A_P4_S3	See Note 6, "Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of this annual report.
21510_18_ITEM7A_P4_S4	We do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments.
21510_18_ITEM7A_P4_S5	There can be no assurance that these strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately.
21510_18_ITEM7A_P4_S6	While we model currency valuations and fluctuations, these may not ultimately be accurate.
21510_18_ITEM7A_P4_S7	If a financial counterparty to any of our hedging arrangements experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge, we may experience material financial losses.
21510_18_ITEM7A_P5_S0	In the current economic environment, the risk of failure of a financial party remains high.
21510_18_ITEM7A_P6_S0	At September 29, 2018 , approximately $215.7 million of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were held outside the U.S. in certain of our foreign operations, $191.2 million of which was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
21510_18_ITEM7A_P6_S1	A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency rates on our forward contracts would not have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
21510_18_ITEM7A_P7_S0	The following table provides information about our foreign exchange forward contracts at September 29, 2018 .
21510_18_ITEM7A_P7_S1	The table presents the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates, the value of the contracts in U.S. dollars at the contract exchange rate as of the contract maturity date and fair value.
21510_18_ITEM7A_P7_S2	The U.S. fair value represents the fair value of the contracts valued at September 29, 2018 rates.
21510_18_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Forward contracts to sell (buy) foreign currencies (in thousands, except contract rates):
21510_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	See Item 15-(a) for an index to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Financial Information, which are attached hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
21510_18_ITEM8_P0_S1	The financial statements and notes thereto can be found beginning on page 67 of this annual report.
21510_18_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by this annual report ("Evaluation Date").
21510_18_ITEM9A_P0_S1	The controls evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.
21510_18_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
21510_18_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the Company.
21510_18_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2018 , utilizing the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).
21510_18_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on the assessment by management, we determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 29, 2018 .
21510_18_ITEM9A_P1_S3	The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2018 has been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears below.
21510_18_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Inherent Limitations Over Internal Controls Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
21510_18_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
21510_18_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
21510_18_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
21510_18_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
21510_18_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud.
21510_18_ITEM9A_P4_S0	A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
21510_18_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
21510_18_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
21510_18_ITEM9A_P4_S3	Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
21510_18_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting In November 2016, we completed the acquisition of Rofin-Sinar Technologies, Inc. ("Rofin").
21510_18_ITEM9A_P5_S1	We continue to integrate Rofin into our systems and control environment as of September 29, 2018 .
21510_18_ITEM9A_P5_S2	We believe that we have taken the necessary steps to monitor and maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting during this integration.
21510_18_ITEM9A_P6_S0	in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 29, 2018 .
21510_18_ITEM9A_P7_S0	To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Coherent, Inc.
21510_18_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Coherent Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of September 29, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
21510_18_ITEM9A_P8_S1	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2018 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
21510_18_ITEM9A_P8_S2	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 29, 2018 , of the Company and our report dated November 27, 2018 , expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
21510_18_ITEM9A_P8_S3	Basis for Opinion The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
21510_18_ITEM9A_P8_S4	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
21510_18_ITEM9A_P8_S5	We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
21510_18_ITEM9A_P8_S6	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
21510_18_ITEM9A_P8_S7	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
21510_18_ITEM9A_P8_S8	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
21510_18_ITEM9A_P8_S9	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
21510_18_ITEM9A_P9_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
21510_18_ITEM9A_P9_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
21510_18_ITEM9A_P9_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
21510_18_ITEM9A_P9_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
21510_18_ITEM10_P0_S0	Business Conduct Policy We have adopted a worldwide Business Conduct Policy that applies to the members of our Board of Directors, executive officers and other employees.

21510_18_ITEM15_P7_S0	STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY Management is responsible for the preparation, integrity, and objectivity of the Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information included in the Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
21510_18_ITEM15_P7_S1	The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and reflect the effects of certain estimates and judgments made by management.
21510_18_ITEM15_P7_S2	It is critical for investors and other readers of the Consolidated Financial Statements to have confidence that the financial information that we provide is timely, complete, relevant and accurate.
21510_18_ITEM15_P8_S0	Management, with oversight by the Company's Board of Directors, has established and maintains a corporate culture that requires that the Company's affairs be conducted to the highest standards of business ethics and conduct.
21510_18_ITEM15_P8_S1	Management also maintains a system of internal controls that is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that transactions are properly recorded and executed in accordance with management's authorization.
21510_18_ITEM15_P8_S2	This system is regularly monitored through direct management review, as well as extensive audits conducted by internal auditors throughout the organization.
21510_18_ITEM15_P8_S3	Our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended September 29, 2018 have been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm.
21510_18_ITEM15_P8_S4	Their audit was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and included an integrated audit under such standards.
21510_18_ITEM15_P9_S0	The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors meets regularly with management, the internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm to review accounting, reporting, auditing and internal control matters.
21510_18_ITEM15_P9_S1	The Audit Committee has direct and private access to both internal and external auditors.

21510_18_ITEM15_P11_S0	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Coherent, Inc.
21510_18_ITEM15_P12_S0	Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Coherent, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017 , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2018 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements").
21510_18_ITEM15_P12_S1	In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2018 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
21510_18_ITEM15_P12_S2	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2018 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 27, 2018 , expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
21510_18_ITEM15_P12_S3	Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
21510_18_ITEM15_P12_S4	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits.
21510_18_ITEM15_P12_S5	We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
21510_18_ITEM15_P12_S6	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
21510_18_ITEM15_P12_S7	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
21510_18_ITEM15_P12_S8	Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
21510_18_ITEM15_P12_S9	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
21510_18_ITEM15_P12_S10	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
21510_18_ITEM15_P12_S11	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
21510_18_ITEM15_P13_S0	We have served as the Company's auditor since 1976.
21510_18_ITEM15_P14_S0	See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

21510_18_ITEM15_P18_S0	DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Founded in 1966, Coherent, Inc. provides lasers, laser-based technologies and laser-based system solutions in a broad range of commercial, industrial and scientific research applications.
21510_18_ITEM15_P18_S1	Coherent designs, manufactures, services and markets lasers and related accessories for a diverse group of customers.
21510_18_ITEM15_P18_S2	Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, the Company has worldwide operations including research and development, manufacturing, sales, service and support capabilities.
21510_18_ITEM15_P19_S0	Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30.
21510_18_ITEM15_P19_S1	Fiscal years 2018 , 2017 and 2016 ended on September 29, 2018 , September 30, 2017 and October 1, 2016 , respectively, and are referred to in these financial statements as fiscal 2018 , fiscal 2017 , and fiscal 2016 for convenience.
21510_18_ITEM15_P19_S2	Fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 include 52 weeks.
21510_18_ITEM15_P19_S3	The fiscal years of the majority of our international subsidiaries end on September 30.
21510_18_ITEM15_P19_S4	Accordingly, the financial statements of these subsidiaries as of that date and for the years then ended have been used for our consolidated financial statements.
21510_18_ITEM15_P19_S5	Management believes that the impact of the use of different year-ends is immaterial to our consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.
21510_18_ITEM15_P20_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
21510_18_ITEM15_P20_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
21510_18_ITEM15_P21_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Coherent, Inc. and its direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company", "we", "our", "us" or "Coherent").
21510_18_ITEM15_P21_S1	Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
21510_18_ITEM15_P22_S0	We include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the respective dates of acquisition.
21510_18_ITEM15_P22_S1	We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our business acquisitions to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, based on their estimated fair values.
21510_18_ITEM15_P22_S2	The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.
21510_18_ITEM15_P23_S0	On November 7, 2016, we acquired Rofin-Sinar Technologies, Inc. and its direct and indirect subsidiaries ("Rofin").
21510_18_ITEM15_P23_S1	On March 8, 2018, we acquired privately held O.R. Lasertechnologie GmbH and certain assets of its U.S.-based affiliate (collectively "OR Laser").
21510_18_ITEM15_P23_S2	The significant accounting policies of Rofin and OR Laser have been aligned to conform to those of Coherent, and the consolidated financial statements include the results of Rofin and OR Laser as of their acquisition dates.
21510_18_ITEM15_P24_S0	The carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments including accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
21510_18_ITEM15_P25_S0	Short-term investments are comprised of available-for-sale securities, which are carried at fair value.
21510_18_ITEM15_P25_S1	Other non-current assets include trading securities and life insurance contracts related to our deferred compensation plans; trading securities are carried at fair value and life insurance contracts are carried at cash surrender values, which due to their ability to be converted to cash at that amount, approximate their fair values.
21510_18_ITEM15_P26_S0	Foreign exchange contracts are stated at fair value based on prevailing financial market information.
21510_18_ITEM15_P26_S1	Short-term and long-term debt is carried at amortized cost, which approximates its fair value based on borrowing rates currently available to us for loans with similar terms.
21510_18_ITEM15_P27_S0	Cash Equivalents All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.
21510_18_ITEM15_P27_S1	At fiscal 2018 year-end, cash and cash equivalents included cash and money market funds.
21510_18_ITEM15_P28_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2.
21510_18_ITEM15_P29_S0	Financial instruments that may potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable.
21510_18_ITEM15_P29_S1	At fiscal 2018 year-end, the majority of our short-term investments were in U.S. Treasury and agency obligations.
21510_18_ITEM15_P29_S2	Cash equivalents and short-term investments are maintained with several financial institutions and may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such balances.
21510_18_ITEM15_P29_S3	At September 29, 2018 , we held cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments outside the U.S. in certain of our foreign operations totaling approximately $215.7 million , $191.2 million of which was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
21510_18_ITEM15_P30_S0	The majority of our accounts receivable are derived from sales to customers for commercial applications.
21510_18_ITEM15_P30_S1	We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition and limit the amount of credit extended when deemed necessary but generally require no collateral.
21510_18_ITEM15_P30_S2	In certain instances, we may require customers to issue a letter of credit.
21510_18_ITEM15_P30_S3	We maintain reserves for potential credit losses.
21510_18_ITEM15_P30_S4	Our products are broadly distributed and there was one customer who accounted for 16.4% and 19.0% of accounts receivable at fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 year-end, respectively.
21510_18_ITEM15_P30_S5	We had another customer who accounted for 16.7% and 10.0% of accounts receivable at fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 year-end, respectively.
21510_18_ITEM15_P31_S0	Our primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate risk.
21510_18_ITEM15_P31_S1	Principal currencies hedged include the Euro, South Korean Won, Japanese Yen, Chinese Renminbi, Singapore Dollar, British Pound, Malaysian Ringgit, Swiss Franc and Canadian Dollar.
21510_18_ITEM15_P32_S0	Our derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value, on a gross basis, and are included in other current assets and other current liabilities.
21510_18_ITEM15_P32_S1	Our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments are based on whether they meet the criteria for designation as a cash flow hedge.
21510_18_ITEM15_P32_S2	Changes in the fair value of these cash flow hedges that are highly effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same line item on the consolidated statements of operations as the impact of the hedged transaction during the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
21510_18_ITEM15_P33_S0	The ineffective portion of cash flow hedges are recognized immediately in other income and expenses.
21510_18_ITEM15_P34_S0	Derivatives that we designate as cash flow hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the same section as the underlying item, primarily within cash flows from operating activities.
21510_18_ITEM15_P34_S1	The changes in fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges are recognized immediately in other income (expense).
21510_18_ITEM15_P34_S2	We formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
21510_18_ITEM15_P35_S0	This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as cash-flow hedges to specific forecasted transactions.
21510_18_ITEM15_P35_S1	We also assess, both at the hedge's inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items.
21510_18_ITEM15_P36_S0	Accounts Receivable Allowances Accounts receivable allowances reflect our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our accounts receivable balances, including both losses for uncollectible accounts receivable and sales returns.
21510_18_ITEM15_P37_S0	We regularly review allowances by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality, the age of the accounts receivable balances and current economic conditions that may affect a customer's ability to pay.
21510_18_ITEM15_P38_S0	Activity in accounts receivable allowance is as follows (in thousands):
21510_18_ITEM15_P39_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2.
21510_18_ITEM15_P40_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out or weighted average cost) or net realizable value.
21510_18_ITEM15_P40_S1	Inventories are as follows (in thousands):
21510_18_ITEM15_P41_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method.
21510_18_ITEM15_P41_S1	Cost, accumulated depreciation and amortization, and estimated useful lives are as follows (dollars in thousands):
21510_18_ITEM15_P42_S0	The fair value (the present value of estimated cash flows) of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.
21510_18_ITEM15_P42_S1	The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset.
21510_18_ITEM15_P42_S2	All of our existing asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return the property to its original condition upon lease termination at various sites and costs to clean up and dispose of certain fixed assets at our Sunnyvale, California site.
21510_18_ITEM15_P42_S3	We estimated that as of fiscal 2018 year-end, gross expected future cash flows of $6.6 million would be required to fulfill these obligations.
21510_18_ITEM15_P42_S4	The following table reconciles changes in our asset retirement liability for fiscal 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):
21510_18_ITEM15_P43_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2.
21510_18_ITEM15_P44_S0	At September 29, 2018 , $1,273 and $4,529 of the asset retirement liability are included in Other current liabilities and Other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, respectively.
21510_18_ITEM15_P44_S1	At September 30, 2017 , the asset retirement liability is included in Other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
21510_18_ITEM15_P45_S0	Long-lived Assets We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, whenever events or changes in business circumstances or our planned use of long-lived assets indicate that their carrying amounts may not be fully recoverable or that their useful lives are no longer appropriate.
21510_18_ITEM15_P45_S1	Reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying values of long-lived assets are impaired based on a comparison to the undiscounted expected future net cash flows.
21510_18_ITEM15_P45_S2	If the comparison indicates that impairment exists, long-lived assets that are classified as held and used are written down to their respective fair values.
21510_18_ITEM15_P46_S0	When long-lived assets are classified as held for sale, they are written down to their respective fair values less costs to sell.
21510_18_ITEM15_P46_S1	Significant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that is used in the preparation of expected undiscounted cash flows.
21510_18_ITEM15_P47_S0	For fiscal 2018 and 2017 , we recorded impairment charges of $0.3 million and $2.9 million , respectively, on the net assets of several entities acquired in the acquisition of Rofin to write them down to reflect our best estimate of fair value, less costs to sell (See Note 18, "Discontinued Operations and Sale of Assets Held for Sale").
21510_18_ITEM15_P47_S1	In addition, in fiscal 2018, we recorded an impairment charge of $0.5 million to reduce the carrying value of a building to its fair value.
21510_18_ITEM15_P47_S2	In fiscal 2016, there were no significant asset impairments recorded.
21510_18_ITEM15_P47_S3	Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and written down when impaired (See Note 7, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets").
21510_18_ITEM15_P48_S0	In testing for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
21510_18_ITEM15_P48_S1	Moreover, an entity can bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to the impairment test, and then resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period.
21510_18_ITEM15_P48_S2	In both our fiscal 2018 and 2017 annual testing, we performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill for our OLS reporting unit using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and noted no impairment.
21510_18_ITEM15_P48_S3	For the ILS reporting unit, in our fiscal 2018 annual testing, we performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and noted no impairment.
21510_18_ITEM15_P48_S4	For the ILS reporting unit, in our fiscal 2017 annual testing, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the goodwill impairment test.
21510_18_ITEM15_P48_S5	Accordingly, we performed our impairment test using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and noted no impairment in fiscal 2017 .
21510_18_ITEM15_P49_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets, including acquired existing technology, customer relationships, trade name and patents are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, currently 3 year to 15 years (See Note 7, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets").
21510_18_ITEM15_P50_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2.
21510_18_ITEM15_P51_S0	We provide warranties on the majority of our product sales and reserves for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale.
21510_18_ITEM15_P51_S1	The determination of such reserves requires us to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty.
21510_18_ITEM15_P51_S2	We currently establish warranty reserves based on historical warranty costs for each product line.
21510_18_ITEM15_P51_S3	The weighted average warranty period covered is approximately 15 months .
21510_18_ITEM15_P51_S4	If actual return rates and/or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates, adjustments to cost of sales may be required in future periods.
21510_18_ITEM15_P52_S0	Components of the reserve for warranty costs during fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in thousands):
21510_18_ITEM15_P53_S0	Loss Contingencies We are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business.
21510_18_ITEM15_P53_S1	We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset, or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies.
21510_18_ITEM15_P53_S2	An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.
21510_18_ITEM15_P53_S3	If we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined, then we disclose the range of the possible loss.
21510_18_ITEM15_P53_S4	We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted or a range of possible loss should be disclosed.
21510_18_ITEM15_P54_S0	When a sales arrangement contains multiple elements, such as products and/or services, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy.
21510_18_ITEM15_P54_S1	Using the selling price hierarchy, we determine the selling price of each deliverable using vendor specific objective evidence ("VSOE"), if it exists, and otherwise third-party evidence ("TPE").
21510_18_ITEM15_P54_S2	If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exists, we use estimated selling price ("ESP").
21510_18_ITEM15_P54_S3	We generally expect that we will not be able to establish TPE due to the nature of the markets in which we compete, and, as such, we typically will determine selling price using VSOE or if not available, ESP.
21510_18_ITEM15_P55_S0	Our basis for establishing VSOE of a deliverable's selling price consists of standalone sales transactions when the same or similar product or service is sold separately.
21510_18_ITEM15_P55_S1	However, when services are never sold separately, such as product installation services, VSOE is based on the product's estimated installation hours based on historical experience multiplied by the standard service billing rate.
21510_18_ITEM15_P56_S0	In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling price for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow price range, as defined by us.
21510_18_ITEM15_P56_S1	We also consider the geographies in which the products or services are sold, major product and service groups, and other environmental variables in determining VSOE.
21510_18_ITEM15_P56_S2	Absent the existence of VSOE and TPE, our determination of a deliverable's ESP involves evaluating several factors based on the specific facts and circumstances of these arrangements, which include pricing strategy and policies driven by geographies, market conditions, competitive landscape, correlation between proportionate selling price and list price established by management having the relevant authority, and other environmental variables in which the deliverable is sold.
21510_18_ITEM15_P57_S0	For multiple element arrangements which include extended maintenance contracts, we allocate and defer the amount of consideration equal to the separately stated price and recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
21510_18_ITEM15_P57_S1	We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered or the service has been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured.
21510_18_ITEM15_P57_S2	Revenue from product sales is recorded when all of the foregoing conditions are met and risk of loss and title passes to the customer.
21510_18_ITEM15_P57_S3	Sales to customers are generally not subject to any price protection or return rights.
21510_18_ITEM15_P58_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2.
21510_18_ITEM15_P59_S0	The majority of our sales are made to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), distributors, representatives and end-users in the non-scientific market.
21510_18_ITEM15_P59_S1	Sales made to these customers do not require installation of the products by us and are not subject to other post-delivery obligations, except in occasional instances where we have agreed to perform installation or provide training.
21510_18_ITEM15_P59_S2	In those instances, we defer revenue related to installation services or training until these services have been rendered.
21510_18_ITEM15_P59_S3	We allocate revenue from multiple element arrangements to the various elements based upon relative fair values.
21510_18_ITEM15_P59_S4	Our sales to distributors, representatives and end-user customers typically do not have customer acceptance provisions and only certain of our sales to OEM customers and integrators have customer acceptance provisions.
21510_18_ITEM15_P59_S5	Customer acceptance is generally limited to performance under our published product specifications.
21510_18_ITEM15_P59_S6	For the few product sales that have customer acceptance provisions because of higher than published specifications, (1) the products are tested and accepted by the customer at our site or the customer accepts the results of our testing program prior to shipment to the customer, or (2) the revenue is deferred until customer acceptance occurs.
21510_18_ITEM15_P60_S0	Sales to end-users in the scientific market typically require installation and, thus, involve post-delivery obligations; however, our post-delivery installation obligations are not essential to the functionality of our products.
21510_18_ITEM15_P60_S1	We defer revenue related to installation services until completion of these services.
21510_18_ITEM15_P61_S0	For most products, training is not provided; therefore, no post-delivery training obligation exists.
21510_18_ITEM15_P61_S1	However, when training is provided to our customers, it is typically priced separately and is recognized as revenue as these services are provided.
21510_18_ITEM15_P62_S0	We record taxes collected on revenue-producing activities on a net basis.
21510_18_ITEM15_P62_S1	Research and Development Research and development expenses include salaries, contractor and consultant fees, supplies and materials, as well as costs related to other overhead such as depreciation, facilities, utilities and other departmental expenses.
21510_18_ITEM15_P62_S2	The costs we incur with respect to internally developed technology and engineering services are included in research and development expenses as incurred as they do not directly relate to any particular licensee, license agreement or license fee.
21510_18_ITEM15_P62_S3	We treat third party and government funding of our research and development activity, where we are the primary beneficiary of such work conducted, as a reduction of research and development cost.
21510_18_ITEM15_P62_S4	Research and development reimbursements of $3.2 million , $2.9 million and $2.7 million were offset against research and development costs in fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
21510_18_ITEM15_P63_S0	The functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are generally their respective local currencies.
21510_18_ITEM15_P63_S1	Accordingly, gains and losses from the translation of the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income ("OCI").
21510_18_ITEM15_P63_S2	Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in earnings.
21510_18_ITEM15_P64_S0	Comprehensive Income (Loss) Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources.
21510_18_ITEM15_P64_S1	Accumulated other comprehensive income (net of tax) at fiscal 2018 year-end is substantially comprised of accumulated translation adjustments of $(1.8) million and deferred actuarial gains on pension plans of $4.6 million .
21510_18_ITEM15_P64_S2	Accumulated other comprehensive income (net of tax) at fiscal 2017 year-end is substantially comprised of accumulated translation adjustments of $16.3 million and deferred actuarial gains on pension plans of $ 3.6 million .
21510_18_ITEM15_P65_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period, excluding unvested restricted stock.
21510_18_ITEM15_P65_S1	Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period increased by the effect of dilutive employee stock awards, including stock options, restricted stock awards and stock purchase plan contracts, using the treasury stock method.

21510_18_ITEM15_P67_S0	The following table presents information necessary to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share (in thousands, except per share data):
21510_18_ITEM15_P68_S0	There were 103,547 , 505 and 323 potentially dilutive securities excluded from the dilutive share calculation for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively, as their effect was anti-dilutive.
21510_18_ITEM15_P69_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We recognize compensation expense for all shared based payment awards based on the fair value of such awards.
21510_18_ITEM15_P70_S0	We value restricted stock units using the intrinsic value method, which is based on the fair market value price on the grant date.
21510_18_ITEM15_P70_S1	We use a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the fair value of performance restricted stock units.
21510_18_ITEM15_P71_S0	We amortize the fair value of stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods.
21510_18_ITEM15_P71_S1	See Note 12, "Employee Stock Award and Benefit Plans" for a description of our stock-based employee compensation plans and the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of stock-based employee compensation.
21510_18_ITEM15_P72_S0	We record costs related to shipping and handling of net sales in cost of sales for all periods presented.
21510_18_ITEM15_P72_S1	Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are included in net sales.
21510_18_ITEM15_P72_S2	Custom duties billed to customers are recorded in cost of sales.
21510_18_ITEM15_P73_S0	Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income tax provision (benefit) in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
21510_18_ITEM15_P73_S1	This process involves us estimating our current income tax provision (benefit) together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
21510_18_ITEM15_P73_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets.
21510_18_ITEM15_P74_S0	We account for uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740-10 Income Taxes , which creates a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.
21510_18_ITEM15_P74_S1	This standard provides a two-step approach for evaluating tax positions.
21510_18_ITEM15_P74_S2	The first step, recognition, occurs when a company concludes (based solely on the technical aspects of the matter) that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority.
21510_18_ITEM15_P74_S3	The second step, measurement, is only considered after step one has been satisfied and measures any tax benefit at the largest amount that is deemed more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the uncertainty.
21510_18_ITEM15_P74_S4	These determinations involve significant judgment by management.
21510_18_ITEM15_P74_S5	Tax positions that fail to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first subsequent interim period that they meet the more likely than not standard or when they are resolved through negotiation or litigation with factual interpretation, judgment and certainty.
21510_18_ITEM15_P75_S0	Tax laws and regulations themselves are complex and are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, evolution of regulations and court filings.
21510_18_ITEM15_P75_S1	Therefore, the actual liability for U.S. or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially to reverse previously recorded tax liabilities.
21510_18_ITEM15_P76_S0	We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized.

21510_18_ITEM15_P78_S0	the period such determination was made.
21510_18_ITEM15_P78_S1	Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.
21510_18_ITEM15_P79_S0	We historically asserted our intention to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings.
21510_18_ITEM15_P79_S1	However, we have reevaluated our historic assertion as a result of enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ) and no longer consider certain historic foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries.
21510_18_ITEM15_P79_S2	As a result of this change in assertion, we recorded a $13.7 million tax expense for foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
21510_18_ITEM15_P79_S3	We will continue to assert an indefinite reinvestment of certain historic foreign earnings and profits of $488.0 million and may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and certain state income taxes upon repatriation.
21510_18_ITEM15_P79_S4	We also have not recognized any deferred taxes for outside basis differences in our foreign subsidiaries.
21510_18_ITEM15_P80_S0	Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB ) issued amended guidance that improves the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.
21510_18_ITEM15_P80_S1	Under the new guidance, an entity should recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs.
21510_18_ITEM15_P80_S2	The new standard is required to be adopted in the first quarter of our fiscal 2019.
21510_18_ITEM15_P80_S3	We elected to early adopt the amended guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
21510_18_ITEM15_P80_S4	The effect of adoption is a decrease in our opening retained earnings by $6.1 million with a comparable decrease to our non-current prepaid income tax balance.
21510_18_ITEM15_P81_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance that simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows.
21510_18_ITEM15_P81_S1	Under the new guidance, an entity recognizes all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement.
21510_18_ITEM15_P81_S2	This change eliminates the notion of the additional paid-in capital pool and significantly reduces the complexity and cost of accounting for excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies.
21510_18_ITEM15_P82_S0	Upon our adoption in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we recognized a windfall tax benefit as a cumulative effect adjustment increase to our opening retained earnings of $19.8 million together with a comparable increase in deferred tax assets.
21510_18_ITEM15_P82_S1	With adoption occurring at the beginning of fiscal 2018, we recognized excess tax benefits from stock award exercises and restricted stock unit vesting as a discrete tax benefit, which reduced the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2018 by $12.8 million .
21510_18_ITEM15_P82_S2	The adoption also changed the calculation of fully diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2018.
21510_18_ITEM15_P82_S3	The excess tax benefits have been excluded from the calculation of assumed proceeds in our calculation of diluted weighted average shares under the new standard.
21510_18_ITEM15_P82_S4	Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding for fiscal 2018 increased by 71,010 shares due to adoption of the new standard.
21510_18_ITEM15_P82_S5	Additionally, effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, excess tax benefits are classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows instead of as a financing activity where they were previously presented.
21510_18_ITEM15_P82_S6	We adopted this guidance on a prospective basis and, accordingly, prior periods have not been adjusted.
21510_18_ITEM15_P82_S7	We have elected to not estimate forfeitures expected to occur to determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period.
21510_18_ITEM15_P82_S8	The remaining provisions of this amended guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
21510_18_ITEM15_P83_S0	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In August 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) adopted amendments to certain disclosure requirements in Securities Act Release No. 33-10532, Disclosure Update and Simplification .
21510_18_ITEM15_P83_S1	The amendments became effective on November 5, 2018.
21510_18_ITEM15_P83_S2	The SEC staff subsequently indicated that it would not object if a filer s first presentation of changes in shareholders equity is included in its Form 10-Q for the quarter that begins after the final rule s effective date.
21510_18_ITEM15_P83_S3	Among the amendments is the requirement to present the changes in shareholders equity in the interim financial statements (either in a separate statement or footnote) in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.
21510_18_ITEM15_P83_S4	The analysis should present a reconciliation of the beginning balance to the ending balance of each period for which a consolidated statement of operations is required to be filed.
21510_18_ITEM15_P83_S5	We will include the first presentation of changes in stockholders equity on Form 10-Q in our first quarter of fiscal 2019.
21510_18_ITEM15_P84_S0	In August 2018, the FASB issued amended guidance to align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal use software license).
21510_18_ITEM15_P84_S1	The accounting for the service element of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract is not affected by the amendments.
21510_18_ITEM15_P85_S0	According to the amendments, the entity shall determine which implementation costs to capitalize as an asset related to the service contract and which costs to expense.

21510_18_ITEM15_P87_S1	The new standard will become effective for our fiscal 2021, which begins on October 4, 2020.
21510_18_ITEM15_P87_S2	We are currently assessing the impact of this amended guidance.
21510_18_ITEM15_P88_S0	In August 2018, the FASB issued amended guidance to modify the disclosure requirements for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans.
21510_18_ITEM15_P88_S1	The new standard will become effective for our fiscal 2021, which begins on October 4, 2020.
21510_18_ITEM15_P88_S2	We are currently assessing the impact of this amended guidance.
21510_18_ITEM15_P89_S0	In August 2018, the FASB issued amended guidance to modify the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, based on the concepts in the Concepts Statement, including the consideration of costs and benefits.
21510_18_ITEM15_P89_S1	The new standard will become effective for our fiscal 2021, which begins on October 4, 2020.
21510_18_ITEM15_P89_S2	We are currently assessing the impact of this amended guidance.
21510_18_ITEM15_P89_S3	In June 2018, the FASB issued amended guidance to expand the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from non-employees.
21510_18_ITEM15_P89_S4	The amendments specify that Topic 718 applies to all share-based payment transactions in which a grantor acquires goods or services to be used or consumed in a grantor s own operations by issuing share-based payment awards.
21510_18_ITEM15_P89_S5	The new standard will become effective for our fiscal 2020, which begins on September 29, 2019.
21510_18_ITEM15_P89_S6	We are currently assessing the impact of this amended guidance.
21510_18_ITEM15_P89_S7	In February 2018, the FASB issued amended guidance to allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
21510_18_ITEM15_P89_S8	Consequently, the amendments eliminate the stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and will improve the usefulness of information reported to financial statement users.
21510_18_ITEM15_P89_S9	However, because the amendments only relate to the reclassification of the income tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the underlying guidance that requires that the effect of a change in tax laws or rates be included in income from continuing operations is not affected.
21510_18_ITEM15_P89_S10	The amendments also require certain disclosures about stranded tax effects.
21510_18_ITEM15_P89_S11	The new standard will become effective for our fiscal 2020, which begins on September 29, 2019.
21510_18_ITEM15_P89_S12	We are currently assessing the impact of this amended guidance.
21510_18_ITEM15_P90_S0	In August 2017, the FASB issued amended guidance to address the current limitation on how an entity can designate the hedged risk in certain cash flow and fair value hedging relationships pursuant to U.S. GAAP.
21510_18_ITEM15_P90_S1	This amendment better aligns an entity s risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships through changes to both designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results.
21510_18_ITEM15_P90_S2	The amendment made specific improvements on hedge accounting for risk components in hedging relationships involving nonfinancial risk and interest rate risk for cash flow hedges of forecasted purchases or sales of a nonfinancial asset, cash flow hedges of interest rate risk of variable-rate financial instruments and fair value hedges of interest rate risk.
21510_18_ITEM15_P91_S0	Upon adoption, for cash flow and net investment hedges existing, an entity should apply a cumulative-effect adjustment related to eliminating the separate measurement of ineffectiveness to other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year that an entity adopts the amendment.
21510_18_ITEM15_P91_S1	The amended presentation and disclosure guidance is required only prospectively.
21510_18_ITEM15_P91_S2	The new standard will become effective for our fiscal 2020 which begins on September 29, 2019.
21510_18_ITEM15_P91_S3	We are currently assessing the impact of this amended guidance.
21510_18_ITEM15_P91_S4	In February 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance that modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.
21510_18_ITEM15_P91_S5	The new standard will become effective for our fiscal 2020, which begins on September 29, 2019.
21510_18_ITEM15_P91_S6	We will adopt the new guidance utilizing the modified retrospective transition method.
21510_18_ITEM15_P91_S7	We have reviewed the requirements of this standard and have formulated a plan for implementation.
21510_18_ITEM15_P91_S8	We are currently working on accumulating a complete population of leases from all of our locations and have selected a software repository to track all of our lease agreements and to assist in the reporting and disclosure requirements required by the standard.
21510_18_ITEM15_P91_S9	We will continue to assess and disclose the impact that this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements, disclosures and related controls, when known.
21510_18_ITEM15_P92_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASU 2014-09"), which outlines a single, comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers.
21510_18_ITEM15_P92_S1	The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services.
21510_18_ITEM15_P92_S2	ASU 2014-09 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, accordingly, we expect more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than is required under the previous revenue recognition standard, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation.
21510_18_ITEM15_P92_S3	ASU 2014-09 is effective for us beginning on the first day of fiscal 2019, which is September 30, 2018.

21510_18_ITEM15_P94_S1	We elected to adopt ASU 2014-09 using the modified retrospective method and will apply the standard to contracts that are not completed as of September 30, 2018 and all new contracts entered into by the Company subsequent to September 30, 2018.
21510_18_ITEM15_P94_S2	All prior period financial statements and disclosures will be presented in accordance with Topic 605.
21510_18_ITEM15_P94_S3	We have completed our analysis of open revenue contracts as of September 30, 2018.
21510_18_ITEM15_P94_S4	We have concluded that the adoption of the new standard will not have a material impact on the timing or amount of revenue recognized primarily as a result of a majority of our sales of products and services are not bundled and therefore revenue will be recorded at the point-in-time when control transfers, which reflects the same timing of revenue recognition under ASC 605.
21510_18_ITEM15_P95_S0	In the preparation for the adoption of ASU 2014-09, we have implemented internal controls to enable the preparation of financial information and related disclosures in accordance with this standard.
21510_18_ITEM15_P96_S0	BUSINESS COMBINATIONS Fiscal 2018 Acquisitions OR Laser On March 8, 2018, we acquired OR Laser for approximately $47.4 million , excluding transaction costs.
21510_18_ITEM15_P97_S0	OR Laser produces laser-based material processing equipment for a variety of uses, including additive manufacturing, welding, cladding, marking, engraving and drilling.
21510_18_ITEM15_P97_S1	OR Laser's operating results have been included in our Industrial Lasers Systems segment.
21510_18_ITEM15_P97_S2	Our allocation of the purchase price is as follows (in thousands):
21510_18_ITEM15_P98_S0	Results of operations for the business have been included in our consolidated financial statements subsequent to the date of acquisition and pro forma results of operations in accordance with authoritative guidance for prior periods have not been presented because the effect of the acquisition was not material to our prior period consolidated financial results.
21510_18_ITEM15_P99_S0	The identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over their respective preliminary useful lives of 1 to 8 years .
21510_18_ITEM15_P99_S1	The fair value of the acquired intangibles was determined using the income approach.
21510_18_ITEM15_P99_S2	In performing these valuations, the key underlying probability-adjusted assumptions of the discounted cash flows were projected revenues, gross margin expectations and operating cost estimates.

21510_18_ITEM15_P101_S1	There are inherent uncertainties and management judgment required in these determinations.
21510_18_ITEM15_P102_S0	This acquisition resulted in a purchase price that exceeded the estimated fair value of tangible and intangible assets, which was allocated to goodwill.
21510_18_ITEM15_P102_S1	We believe the amount of goodwill relative to identifiable intangible assets relates to several factors including: (1) potential buyer-specific synergies related to the development of new technologies related primarily to the additive manufacturing business and (2) the potential to leverage our sales force to attract new customers and revenue and cross-sell to existing customers.
21510_18_ITEM15_P102_S2	None of the goodwill from this purchase is deductible for tax purposes.
21510_18_ITEM15_P102_S3	We expensed $0.6 million of acquisition-related costs as selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations in fiscal 2018 .
21510_18_ITEM15_P102_S4	Fiscal 2017 Acquisitions Rofin On November 7, 2016, we completed our acquisition of Rofin pursuant to the Merger Agreement dated March 16, 2016.
21510_18_ITEM15_P103_S0	Rofin was one of the world's leading developers and manufacturers of high-performance industrial laser sources and laser-based solutions and components.
21510_18_ITEM15_P103_S1	Rofin's operating results have been included primarily in our Industrial Lasers Systems segment.
21510_18_ITEM15_P103_S2	As a condition of the acquisition, we were required to divest and hold separate Rofin's low power CO 2 laser business based in Hull, United Kingdom (the "Hull Business"), and had reported this business separately as a discontinued operation until its divestiture.
21510_18_ITEM15_P103_S3	We completed the divestiture of the Hull Business on October 11, 2017, after receiving approval for the terms of the sale from the European Commission.
21510_18_ITEM15_P104_S0	The total purchase consideration has been allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on a valuation analysis.
21510_18_ITEM15_P104_S1	The total purchase consideration allocated to net assets acquired was approximately $936.3 million and consisted of the following (in thousands):
21510_18_ITEM15_P105_S0	The acquisition was an all-cash transaction at a price of $32.50 per share of Rofin common stock.
21510_18_ITEM15_P105_S1	The total payment of $15.3 million due to the cancellation of options held by employees of Rofin was allocated between total estimated merger consideration of $11.1 million and post-merger stock-based compensation expense of $4.2 million based on the portion of the total service period of the underlying options that had not been completed by the merger date.
21510_18_ITEM15_P105_S2	We recognized a gain of $5.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 on the increase in fair value from the date of purchase for the shares of Rofin we owned before the acquisition.
21510_18_ITEM15_P106_S0	Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total estimated acquisition consideration is allocated to the acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities of Rofin based on their fair values as of the acquisition date.
21510_18_ITEM15_P106_S1	Any excess of the acquisition consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill.
21510_18_ITEM15_P106_S2	We concluded that all such goodwill will not be deductible for tax purposes.
21510_18_ITEM15_P106_S3	Our allocation of the purchase price is as follows (in thousands):

21510_18_ITEM15_P108_S1	Accordingly, for fiscal 2017 , we recorded $26.4 million of incremental cost of sales associated with the fair value write-up of inventory acquired in the merger with Rofin.
21510_18_ITEM15_P108_S2	The fair value write-up of inventory acquired was fully amortized in fiscal 2017 .
21510_18_ITEM15_P108_S3	The fair value write-up of acquired property, plant and equipment of $36.0 million will be amortized over the useful lives of the assets, ranging from 3 to 31 years.
21510_18_ITEM15_P108_S4	Property, plant and equipment is valued at its value-in-use, unless there was a known plan to dispose of the asset.
21510_18_ITEM15_P108_S5	The acquired existing technology, backlog, trademarks and patents are being amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the economic use of the asset, over their estimated useful lives of 3 to 5 years, 6 months, 3 years, and 5 years, respectively.
21510_18_ITEM15_P108_S6	Customer relationships are being amortized on an accelerated basis utilizing free cash flows over periods ranging from 5 to 10 years.
21510_18_ITEM15_P108_S7	The useful lives of in-process research and development will be defined in the future upon further evaluation of the status of these applications.
21510_18_ITEM15_P109_S0	The fair value of the acquired intangibles was determined using the income approach.
21510_18_ITEM15_P109_S1	In performing these valuations, the key underlying probability-adjusted assumptions of the discounted cash flows were projected revenues, gross margin expectations and operating cost estimates.
21510_18_ITEM15_P109_S2	The valuations were based on the information that was available as of the acquisition date and the expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by our management.
21510_18_ITEM15_P109_S3	There are inherent uncertainties and management judgment required in these determinations.
21510_18_ITEM15_P110_S0	This acquisition resulted in a purchase price that exceeded the estimated fair value of tangible and intangible assets, which was allocated to goodwill.
21510_18_ITEM15_P110_S1	We believe the amount of goodwill relative to identifiable intangible assets relates to several factors including: (1) potential buyer-specific synergies related to market opportunities for a combined product offering and (2) potential to leverage our sales force to attract new customers and revenue and cross sell to existing customers.
21510_18_ITEM15_P111_S0	In-process research and development ("IPR D") consists of two projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility as of the date of the acquisition.

21510_18_ITEM15_P113_S1	The value assigned to IPR D was determined by considering the value of the products under development to the overall development plan, estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows to their present value.
21510_18_ITEM15_P113_S2	During the development period, these assets will not be amortized as charges to earnings; instead these assets will be subject to periodic impairment testing.
21510_18_ITEM15_P113_S3	Upon successful completion of the development process for the acquired IPR D projects, the assets would then be considered finite-lived intangible assets and amortization of the assets will commence.
21510_18_ITEM15_P113_S4	One project was completed in December 2017 and amortization for that project began in the quarter ended March 31, 2018.
21510_18_ITEM15_P113_S5	The other project has not been completed as of September 29, 2018 and is not expected to be completed in fiscal 2019.
21510_18_ITEM15_P113_S6	We expensed $17.6 million of acquisition-related costs as selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations during fiscal 2017 .
21510_18_ITEM15_P113_S7	None of the goodwill was deductible for tax purposes.
21510_18_ITEM15_P113_S8	The results of this acquisition were included in our consolidated operations beginning on November 7, 2016.
21510_18_ITEM15_P113_S9	The amount of continuing Rofin net sales and net loss from continuing operations included in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2017 was approximately $434.9 million and $48.1 million , respectively.
21510_18_ITEM15_P113_S10	The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents our combined results of operations as if the acquisition of Rofin and the related issuance of our Euro Term Loan had occurred on October 4, 2015.
21510_18_ITEM15_P113_S11	The unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of what our consolidated results of operations actually would have been had the acquisition been completed on October 4, 2015.
21510_18_ITEM15_P113_S12	In addition, the unaudited pro forma financial information does not attempt to project the future results of operations of the combined company.
21510_18_ITEM15_P113_S13	The actual results may differ significantly from the pro forma results presented here due to many factors.
21510_18_ITEM15_P114_S0	The unaudited pro forma financial information above includes the net income of Rofin's low power CO 2 laser business based in Hull, United Kingdom, which is recorded as a discontinued operation in fiscal 2017.

21510_18_ITEM15_P126_S1	The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets.
21510_18_ITEM15_P126_S2	We recognize transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter.
21510_18_ITEM15_P126_S3	There were no transfers between levels during the periods presented.
21510_18_ITEM15_P127_S0	As of September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017 , we did not have any assets or liabilities valued based on Level 3 valuations.
21510_18_ITEM15_P128_S0	We measure the fair value of outstanding debt obligations for disclosure purposes on a recurring basis.
21510_18_ITEM15_P128_S1	As of September 29, 2018 , the current and long-term portion of long-term obligations of $5.1 million and $420.7 million , respectively, are reported at amortized cost.

21510_18_ITEM15_P128_S3	These outstanding obligations are classified as Level 2 as they are not actively traded and are valued using a discounted cash flow model that uses observable market inputs.
21510_18_ITEM15_P128_S4	Based on the discounted cash flow model, the fair value of the outstanding debt approximates amortized cost.
21510_18_ITEM15_P128_S5	Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017 are summarized below (in thousands):

21510_18_ITEM15_P130_S0	(1) Valuations are based upon quoted market prices in active markets involving similar assets.
21510_18_ITEM15_P130_S1	The market inputs used to value these instruments generally consist of market yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.
21510_18_ITEM15_P130_S2	Pricing sources include industry standard data providers, security master files from large financial institutions, and other third party sources which are input into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine a daily market value.
21510_18_ITEM15_P130_S3	This creates a "consensus price" or a weighted average price for each security.
21510_18_ITEM15_P130_S4	(2) The principal market in which we execute our foreign currency contracts is the institutional market in an over-the-counter environment with a relatively high level of price transparency.
21510_18_ITEM15_P130_S5	The market participants usually are large commercial banks.
21510_18_ITEM15_P131_S0	Our foreign currency contracts' valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and quoted pricing intervals from public data sources and do not involve management judgment.
21510_18_ITEM15_P131_S1	(3) The fair value of mutual funds is determined based on quoted market prices.
21510_18_ITEM15_P131_S2	Securities traded on a national exchange are stated at the last reported sales price on the day of valuation; other securities traded in over-the-counter markets and listed securities for which no sale was reported on that date are stated as the last quoted bid price.
21510_18_ITEM15_P132_S0	SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS We consider all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.
21510_18_ITEM15_P132_S1	Investments classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of related income taxes, recorded as a separate component of OCI in stockholders' equity until realized.
21510_18_ITEM15_P132_S2	Interest and amortization of premiums and discounts for debt securities are included in interest income.
21510_18_ITEM15_P132_S3	Gains and losses on securities sold are determined based on the specific identification method and are included in other income (expense).

21510_18_ITEM15_P136_S2	During fiscal 2017 , we received proceeds totaling $0.1 million from the sale of available-for-sale securities and realized no gross gains or losses.
21510_18_ITEM15_P137_S0	DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES We maintain operations in various countries outside of the United States and have foreign subsidiaries that manufacture and sell our products in various global markets.
21510_18_ITEM15_P137_S1	The majority of our sales are transacted in U.S. dollars.
21510_18_ITEM15_P137_S2	However, we do generate revenues in other currencies, primarily the Euro, Japanese Yen, South Korean Won and Chinese Renminbi (RMB).
21510_18_ITEM15_P137_S3	As a result, our earnings, cash flows and cash balances are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
21510_18_ITEM15_P137_S4	We attempt to limit these exposures through financial market instruments.
21510_18_ITEM15_P137_S5	We utilize derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts with maturities of two months or less, to manage our exposure associated with anticipated cash flows and net asset and liability positions denominated in foreign currencies.
21510_18_ITEM15_P137_S6	Gains and losses on the forward contracts are mitigated by gains and losses on the underlying instruments.
21510_18_ITEM15_P138_S0	We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
21510_18_ITEM15_P139_S0	The credit risk amounts represent the Company's gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency rates at each respective date.
21510_18_ITEM15_P140_S0	On August 1, 2016, we purchased forward contracts totaling 670.0 million Euros, with a value date of November 30, 2016, to limit our foreign exchange risk related to the commitment of our Euro Term Loan (denominated in Euros) in an amount of the Euro equivalent of $750.0 million to finance the U.S. dollar payment for our acquisition of Rofin.
21510_18_ITEM15_P140_S1	In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we recognized an unrealized loss of $2.2 million on these forward contracts.
21510_18_ITEM15_P140_S2	In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we settled these forward contracts at a net gain of $9.1 million , resulting in a realized gain of $11.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.

21510_18_ITEM15_P144_S0	Master Netting Arrangements To mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions, we enter into master netting arrangements that allow each counterparty in the arrangements to net settle amounts of multiple and separate derivative transactions under certain conditions.
21510_18_ITEM15_P144_S1	We present the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities within the our consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis even when derivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation.
21510_18_ITEM15_P144_S2	The impact of netting derivative assets and liabilities is not material to our financial position for any of the periods presented.
21510_18_ITEM15_P144_S3	Our derivative contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features and do not require collateral or other security to be furnished by us or the counterparties.
21510_18_ITEM15_P145_S0	GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have occurred, and we write down these assets when impaired.
21510_18_ITEM15_P145_S1	We perform our annual impairment tests during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter, with any resulting impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.
21510_18_ITEM15_P146_S0	As a result of the acquisition of Rofin in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we reorganized our prior two reporting segments (Specialty Laser Systems and Commercial Lasers and Components) into two new reporting segments for the combined company: OEM Laser Sources ("OLS") and Industrial Lasers Systems ("ILS").

21510_18_ITEM15_P149_S0	In our fiscal 2018 annual testing, we performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill for our OLS and ILS reporting units during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 using the opening balance sheet as of the first day of the fourth quarter and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts.
21510_18_ITEM15_P149_S1	In assessing the qualitative factors, we considered the impact of these key factors: macroeconomic conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency, market and industry conditions, our operating and competitive environment, regulatory and political developments, the overall financial performance of the reporting unit including cost factors and budgeted-to-actual revenue results.
21510_18_ITEM15_P149_S2	We also considered our market capitalization, stock price performance and the significant excess between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the OLS and ILS reporting units.
21510_18_ITEM15_P149_S3	Based on our assessment, goodwill in the OLS and ILS reporting units was not impaired as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
21510_18_ITEM15_P149_S4	As such, it was not necessary to perform the goodwill impairment test at that time.
21510_18_ITEM15_P149_S5	Between the completion of our assessment and the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we noted no indications of impairment or triggering events with either reporting unit to cause us to review goodwill for potential impairment.
21510_18_ITEM15_P150_S0	The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment for fiscal 2018 and 2017 are as follows (in thousands):
21510_18_ITEM15_P151_S0	(1) Gross amount of goodwill for our ILS segment was $355.2 million at September 29, 2018 and $328.5 million at September 30, 2017 , respectively.
21510_18_ITEM15_P151_S1	At both September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017 , the accumulated impairment loss for the ILS reporting unit was $13.0 million reflecting an impairment charge in fiscal 2009.
21510_18_ITEM15_P151_S2	(2) Gross amount of goodwill for our OLS segment was $109.5 million and $110.9 million at September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017 , respectively.
21510_18_ITEM15_P151_S3	At both September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017 , the accumulated impairment loss for the OLS reporting unit was $8.7 million reflecting impairment charges in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2009.
21510_18_ITEM15_P152_S0	We evaluate long-lived assets and amortizable intangible assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances or our planned use of assets indicate that their carrying amounts may not be fully recoverable or that their useful lives are no longer appropriate.
21510_18_ITEM15_P152_S1	Reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying values of assets are impaired based on comparison to the undiscounted expected future cash flows identifiable to such long-lived and amortizable intangible assets.
21510_18_ITEM15_P152_S2	If the comparison indicates that impairment exists, the impaired asset is written down to its fair value.
21510_18_ITEM15_P152_S3	In fiscal 2018 and 2017 , we did not have any impairment of intangible assets as a result of the impairment analysis.

21510_18_ITEM15_P164_S1	On November 7, 2016, the Borrower borrowed the full 670.0 million Euros under the Euro Term Loan and its proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of Rofin and pay related fees and expenses.
21510_18_ITEM15_P164_S2	On November 7, 2016, we also used 10.0 million Euros of the capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility for the issuance of a letter of credit.
21510_18_ITEM15_P165_S0	The terms of the Credit Agreement require the Borrower to prepay the term loans in certain circumstances, including from excess cash flow beyond a threshold amount, from the receipt of proceeds from certain dispositions or from the incurrence of certain indebtedness, and from extraordinary receipts resulting in net cash proceeds in excess of $10.0 million in any fiscal year.

21510_18_ITEM15_P184_S0	On May 14, 2013, IMRA America ("Imra") filed a complaint for patent infringement against two of our subsidiaries in the Regional Court of D sseldorf, Germany, captioned In re IMRA America Inc. versus Coherent Kaiserslautern GmbH et.
21510_18_ITEM15_P184_S1	The complaint alleged that the use of certain of the Company's lasers infringed upon EP Patent No. 754,103, entitled "Method For Controlling Configuration of Laser Induced Breakdown and Ablation," issued November 5, 1997.
21510_18_ITEM15_P184_S2	The patent, now expired in all jurisdictions, is owned by the University of Michigan and licensed to Imra.
21510_18_ITEM15_P184_S3	The complaint sought unspecified compensatory damages and the cost of court proceedings and sought to permanently enjoin the Company from infringing the patent in the future.
21510_18_ITEM15_P185_S0	Following the filing of the infringement suit, our subsidiaries filed a separate nullity action with the Federal Patent Court in Munich, Germany requesting that the court hold that the patent was invalid based on prior art.
21510_18_ITEM15_P185_S1	On October 1, 2015, the Federal Patent Court ruled that the German portion of the patent was invalid.
21510_18_ITEM15_P185_S2	Imra appealed this decision to the Federal Court of Justice, the highest civil jurisdiction court in Germany.
21510_18_ITEM15_P185_S3	On March 27, 2018, the Federal Court of Justice dismissed Imra's appeal effectively ending the case in favor of Coherent.
21510_18_ITEM15_P186_S0	Although we do not expect that such legal claims and litigation will ultimately have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, an adverse result in one or more matters could negatively affect our results in the period in which they occur.
21510_18_ITEM15_P187_S0	The United States and many foreign governments impose tariffs and duties on the import and export of certain products we sell.
21510_18_ITEM15_P187_S1	From time to time our customs compliance, product classifications, duty calculations and payments are reviewed or audited by government agencies.
21510_18_ITEM15_P187_S2	On November 7, 2016 , we entered into a Credit Agreement, which was amended on May 8, 2017.

21510_18_ITEM15_P193_S3	Stock Award Plans We maintain a stock plan for which employees, service providers and non-employee directors are eligible participants.
21510_18_ITEM15_P193_S4	This plan, the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2011 Plan"), provides for a number of different equity-based grants, including options, time-based restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units.
21510_18_ITEM15_P193_S5	Under the 2011 Plan, Coherent may grant options and awards (time-based restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units) to purchase up to 6,747,691 shares of common stock, of which 4,780,438 shares remained available for grant at fiscal 2018 year-end.
21510_18_ITEM15_P193_S6	At fiscal 2018 year-end, all outstanding stock options and restricted stock units have been issued under plans approved by our shareholders.
21510_18_ITEM15_P194_S0	Historically, option grants to employees vested over the four years from the original grant date.
21510_18_ITEM15_P194_S1	Since adoption of the 2011 Plan, no stock options have been granted to employees.
21510_18_ITEM15_P194_S2	Some vested options made to one non-employee director under a prior stock plan remain outstanding.
21510_18_ITEM15_P194_S3	Non-employee directors are automatically granted time-based restricted stock units upon first joining the Board of Directors and then upon reelection.
21510_18_ITEM15_P194_S4	New non-employee directors initially receive an award of restricted stock units valued at approximately $225,000 which vest over a two year period.
21510_18_ITEM15_P194_S5	The annual grant for non-employee directors is a value of approximately $225,000 in shares of restricted stock units that vest on February 15 of the calendar year following the grant.
21510_18_ITEM15_P194_S6	Restricted stock awards and restricted stock units are typically subject to vesting restrictions either time-based or market-based conditions for vesting.
21510_18_ITEM15_P194_S7	Until restricted stock vests, shares (including those issuable upon vesting of the applicable restricted stock unit) are subject to forfeiture if employment or service to the Company terminates prior to the release of restrictions and cannot be transferred.
21510_18_ITEM15_P195_S0	The service based restricted stock awards generally vest within three years from the date of grant.
21510_18_ITEM15_P196_S0	The service based restricted stock unit awards are generally subject to annual vesting over three years from the date of grant, though from time-to-time, depending upon exceptional circumstances, the Company has granted restricted stock unit awards with one or two year vesting.
21510_18_ITEM15_P197_S0	The performance restricted stock unit award grants are generally either subject to annual vesting over three years from the date of grant or subject to a single vest measurement three years from the date of grant, depending upon achievement of performance measurements based on the performance of the Company's total shareholder returns (as defined in the plan) compared with the performance of the Russell 1000 Index (or as otherwise determined by the Compensation and HR Committee).
21510_18_ITEM15_P197_S1	We recognize compensation expense for all share-based payment awards based on the fair value of such awards.
21510_18_ITEM15_P197_S2	The expense is recognized on a straight-line basis per tranche over the respective requisite service period of the awards.

21510_18_ITEM15_P199_S0	Valuation and amortization method We estimate the fair value of employee stock purchase shares using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing formula.
21510_18_ITEM15_P199_S1	This fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the purchase period.
21510_18_ITEM15_P200_S0	The expected term represents the period of our employee stock purchase plan.
21510_18_ITEM15_P200_S1	Our process for computing expected volatility considers both historical volatility and market-based implied volatility; however our estimate of expected forfeitures is based on historical employee data and could differ from actual forfeitures.
21510_18_ITEM15_P201_S0	The risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation method is based on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term.
21510_18_ITEM15_P202_S0	The fair values of shares purchased under the employee stock purchase plan for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 were estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:
21510_18_ITEM15_P203_S0	Time-Based Restricted Stock Units Time-based restricted stock units are fair valued at the closing market price on the date of grant.
21510_18_ITEM15_P203_S1	Performance Restricted Stock Units We grant performance restricted stock units to officers and certain employees.
21510_18_ITEM15_P203_S2	The performance restricted stock unit agreements provide for the award of performance stock units with each unit representing the right to receive one share of our common stock to be issued after the applicable award vesting period.
21510_18_ITEM15_P203_S3	The final number of units awarded, if any, for these performance grants will be determined as of the vesting dates, based upon our total shareholder return over the performance period compared to the applicable Russell Index and could range from no units to a maximum of twice the initial award units.
21510_18_ITEM15_P203_S4	The weighted average fair value for these performance units was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model incorporating the following weighted average assumptions:
21510_18_ITEM15_P204_S0	We recognize the estimated cost of these awards, as determined under the simulation model, over the related service period of approximately 3 years, with no adjustment in future periods based upon the actual shareholder return over the performance period.
21510_18_ITEM15_P204_S1	The following table shows total stock-based compensation expense and related tax benefits included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):

21510_18_ITEM15_P206_S1	The payment was allocated between total estimated merger consideration of $11.1 million and post-merger stock-based compensation expense of $4.2 million , recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 , based on the portion of the total service period of the underlying options that have not been completed by the merger date.
21510_18_ITEM15_P206_S2	During fiscal 2018 , $4.7 million of stock-based compensation cost was capitalized as part of inventory for all stock plans, $4.4 million was amortized into cost of sales and $1.5 million remained in inventory at September 29, 2018 .
21510_18_ITEM15_P206_S3	During fiscal 2017 , $3.6 million of stock-based compensation cost was capitalized as part of inventory for all stock plans, $3.3 million was amortized into cost of sales and $1.2 million remained in inventory at September 30, 2017 .
21510_18_ITEM15_P206_S4	At fiscal 2018 year-end, the total compensation cost related to unvested stock-based awards granted to employees under our stock plans but not yet recognized was approximately $36.0 million .
21510_18_ITEM15_P206_S5	This cost will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.4 years.
21510_18_ITEM15_P206_S6	The stock option exercise tax benefits, if any, are reported in the statement of cash flows.
21510_18_ITEM15_P206_S7	The tax benefits result from tax deductions in excess of the stock-based compensation cost recognized and are determined on a grant-by-grant basis.
21510_18_ITEM15_P206_S8	During fiscal 2017 , we recorded approximately $1.6 million of excess tax benefits as cash flows from financing activities.
21510_18_ITEM15_P206_S9	In fiscal 2016, we did not generate any excess tax benefits as cash flows from financing activities.
21510_18_ITEM15_P206_S10	We adopted the new accounting standard on share-based compensation in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
21510_18_ITEM15_P206_S11	As a result, we recognized excess tax benefits from stock award exercises and restricted stock unit vesting as a discrete tax benefit, which reduced the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2018 by $12.8 million .
21510_18_ITEM15_P206_S12	Stock Awards Activity At fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 year-end, we had 24,000 , 24,000 and 33,500 shares subject to vested stock options outstanding.

21510_18_ITEM15_P209_S0	__________________________________________ (1) Service-based restricted stock units vested during each fiscal year.
21510_18_ITEM15_P209_S1	Performance-based restricted stock units included at 100% of target goal; under the terms of the awards, the recipient may earn between 0% and 200% of the award.
21510_18_ITEM15_P210_S0	Restricted Stock Units are converted into the right to receive common stock upon vesting; prior to issuance, the Company permits the employee holders to satisfy their tax withholding requirements by net settlement, whereby the Company withholds a portion of the shares to cover the applicable taxes based on the fair market value of the Company's stock at the vesting date.
21510_18_ITEM15_P210_S1	The number of shares withheld to cover tax payments was 131,000 in fiscal 2018 , 131,000 in fiscal 2017 and 89,000 in fiscal 2016 ; tax payments made were $36.3 million , $15.7 million and $5.4 million , respectively.
21510_18_ITEM15_P211_S0	DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS As a result of the Rofin acquisition, we have assumed all assets and liabilities of Rofin's defined benefit plans for the Rofin-Sinar Laser, GmbH ("RSL") and Rofin-Sinar Inc. ("RS Inc.") employees.
21510_18_ITEM15_P212_S0	The U.S. plan began in fiscal 1995 and is partially funded.
21510_18_ITEM15_P212_S1	Any new employees hired after January 1, 2007, are not eligible for the RS Inc. pension plan.
21510_18_ITEM15_P213_S0	As is the customary practice with German companies, the German pension plan is unfunded.
21510_18_ITEM15_P213_S1	Any new employees hired after 2000 are not eligible for the RSL pension plan.
21510_18_ITEM15_P213_S2	The measurement date of these pension plans is September 30.
21510_18_ITEM15_P213_S3	For these pension plans, actuarial gains and losses are deferred into OCI and amortized over future periods.
21510_18_ITEM15_P214_S0	Effective January 1, 2012, the RS Inc. defined benefit plan was amended to exclude highly compensated employees, as defined by the Internal Revenue Service, from receiving future years of service under the RS Inc. defined benefit plan.
21510_18_ITEM15_P214_S1	A non-qualified defined benefit plan was created to replace the benefits lost by the employees that were otherwise excluded from the qualified defined benefit plan.
21510_18_ITEM15_P214_S2	Effective August 31, 2018 both the RS Inc. plans were amended to freeze all future compensation benefit accruals.
21510_18_ITEM15_P214_S3	In addition, we have defined benefit plans in South Korea, Japan, Spain and Italy, covering all full-time employees with at least one year of service, and a defined benefit plan in Germany covering two individuals.
21510_18_ITEM15_P214_S4	As is the customary practice with European and Asian companies, the plans are unfunded, with the exception of the Spanish plan which is partially funded.
21510_18_ITEM15_P214_S5	We have elected to recognize all actuarial gains and losses on these plans immediately, as incurred.
21510_18_ITEM15_P214_S6	The measurement date of these defined benefit plans is September 30.
21510_18_ITEM15_P215_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 13.
21510_18_ITEM15_P216_S0	For financial reporting purposes, the calculation of net periodic pension costs is based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations, an assumed rate of return on pension assets and an assumed rate of compensation increase for employees covered by the plan.
21510_18_ITEM15_P216_S1	All of these assumptions were based upon management's judgment, considering all known trends and uncertainties.
21510_18_ITEM15_P216_S2	Actual results that differ from these assumptions would impact future expense recognition and the cash funding requirements of our defined benefit plans.
21510_18_ITEM15_P217_S0	Components of net periodic cost are as follows for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):
21510_18_ITEM15_P218_S0	The changes in projected benefit obligations and plan assets, as well as the ending balance sheet amounts for our defined benefit plans, are as follows (in thousands):
21510_18_ITEM15_P219_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 13.
21510_18_ITEM15_P220_S0	(1) The beginning of the year balances in fiscal 2017 relate to plans held in South Korea, Japan, Italy and Germany.
21510_18_ITEM15_P220_S1	These were not disclosed in prior years as the net liability was not material.
21510_18_ITEM15_P220_S2	The information for plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets is as follows (in thousands):
21510_18_ITEM15_P221_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 13.
21510_18_ITEM15_P222_S0	The weighted-average rates used to determine the net periodic benefit costs are as follows:
21510_18_ITEM15_P223_S0	We recognize the over (under) funded status of the defined benefit plans in our consolidated balance sheets.
21510_18_ITEM15_P223_S1	We also recognize, in other comprehensive income (loss), certain gains and losses that arise for the period but are deferred under current pension accounting rules.
21510_18_ITEM15_P224_S0	A one percent change in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would not have a material impact on the projected benefit obligation or the net periodic benefit cost.
21510_18_ITEM15_P225_S0	Expected benefit payments for each of the next five fiscal years and the five years aggregated thereafter is as follows (in thousands):
21510_18_ITEM15_P226_S0	Our pension plan asset allocations at September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017 by asset category are as follows:
21510_18_ITEM15_P227_S0	We employ a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equity, debt securities and government securities are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk.
21510_18_ITEM15_P227_S1	The intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses by maximizing investment returns within that prudent level of risk.
21510_18_ITEM15_P227_S2	Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks as well as growth, value and small and large capitalizations.
21510_18_ITEM15_P228_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 13.
21510_18_ITEM15_P229_S0	maintained at levels adequate to meet near-term plan expenses and benefit payments.
21510_18_ITEM15_P229_S1	Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through semi-annual investment portfolio reviews.
21510_18_ITEM15_P229_S2	Investments in our defined benefit plan are stated at fair value.
21510_18_ITEM15_P230_S0	Level 1 assets are valued using quoted market prices that represent the asset value of the shares held by the trusts.
21510_18_ITEM15_P230_S1	The level 2 assets are investments in pooled funds, which are valued using a model to reflect the valuation of their underlying assets that are publicly traded with observable values.
21510_18_ITEM15_P230_S2	The fair value of level 3 pension plan assets are measured by compiling the portfolio holdings and independently valuing the securities in those portfolios.
21510_18_ITEM15_P230_S3	The fair values of our pension plan assets, by level within the fair value hierarchy, at September 29, 2018 are as follows:
21510_18_ITEM15_P231_S0	The fair values of our pension plan assets, by level within the fair value hierarchy, at September 30, 2017 are as follows:
21510_18_ITEM15_P232_S0	OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET Other income (expense) includes other-net which is comprised of the following (in thousands):
21510_18_ITEM15_P233_S0	The provision for (benefit from) income taxes on income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes consists of the following (in thousands):
21510_18_ITEM15_P234_S0	The components of income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes consist of (in thousands):
21510_18_ITEM15_P235_S0	The reconciliation of the income tax expense at the U.S. Federal statutory rate ( 24.5% in fiscal 2018 and 35.0% in each of fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016) to actual income tax expense is as follows (in thousands):
21510_18_ITEM15_P236_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 15.
21510_18_ITEM15_P237_S0	On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted.
21510_18_ITEM15_P237_S1	The Tax Act contains significant changes to U.S. tax law, including lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21.0% and implementing a territorial tax system.
21510_18_ITEM15_P237_S2	Since we have a September year-end, the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate is phased in.
21510_18_ITEM15_P237_S3	Our U.S. federal blended tax rate is approximately 24.5% for fiscal 2018 and 21.0% for subsequent fiscal years.
21510_18_ITEM15_P237_S4	The reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate adjusts our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower U.S. federal tax rate of 21.0% .
21510_18_ITEM15_P238_S0	There are also certain transitional impacts of the Tax Act.
21510_18_ITEM15_P239_S0	As part of the transition to the new territorial tax system, the Tax Act imposes a one-time deemed repatriation tax on our foreign subsidiaries historical earnings.
21510_18_ITEM15_P239_S1	These transitional impacts resulted in a provisional net charge of $26.7 million for fiscal 2018.
21510_18_ITEM15_P239_S2	This is comprised of an estimated deemed repatriation tax charge of $17.8 million less a previously recorded deferred tax liability of $20.3 million for anticipated repatriation of our investment in a foreign subsidiary, plus an estimated deferred tax remeasurement charge of $15.5 million and an accrual for withholding taxes and state income taxes of $13.7 million on certain foreign earnings not considered permanently reinvested.
21510_18_ITEM15_P240_S0	The Tax Act changes are broad and complex.
21510_18_ITEM15_P240_S1	The final calculation of the Tax Act impact may materially differ from the above provisional estimates.
21510_18_ITEM15_P240_S2	Among other things, this may be due to changes in interpretations of the Tax Act, any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the Tax Act, any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the Tax Act, or any updates or changes to estimates we have utilized to calculate the transitional impacts.
21510_18_ITEM15_P241_S0	No. 118 directing taxpayers to record impacts of the Tax Act as provisional when it does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting under ASC 740.
21510_18_ITEM15_P241_S1	The guidance allows for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the Tax Act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts.
21510_18_ITEM15_P241_S2	Most of that activity has provisionally been recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements in the period ended September 29, 2018, as Treasury has not issued final regulations with respect to the new law.
21510_18_ITEM15_P241_S3	The final regulation may change the provisional estimates.
21510_18_ITEM15_P242_S0	We recorded what we believe to be a reasonable estimate.
21510_18_ITEM15_P243_S0	The Tax Act also includes provisions for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ( GILTI ) wherein taxes on foreign income are imposed in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations.
21510_18_ITEM15_P243_S1	In general, this income will effectively be taxed at a 10.5% tax rate reduced by any available current year foreign tax credits.
21510_18_ITEM15_P243_S2	This provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, which is our fiscal 2019.
21510_18_ITEM15_P243_S3	Because of the complexity of the new GILTI tax rules, we continue to evaluate this provision of the Tax Act including the associated forecast of GILTI and the application of ASC 740, Income Taxes.
21510_18_ITEM15_P244_S0	Under U.S. GAAP, we are allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either (1) treating taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred (the period cost method ) or (2) factoring such amounts into our measurement of our deferred taxes (the deferred method ).
21510_18_ITEM15_P245_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 15.
21510_18_ITEM15_P246_S0	whether we expect to have future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI and, if so, what the impact is expected to be.
21510_18_ITEM15_P246_S1	Whether we expect to have future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI depends on not only our current structure and estimated future results of global operations, but also our intent and ability to modify our structure.
21510_18_ITEM15_P246_S2	We are currently in the process of analyzing our structure and, as a result, are not yet able to reasonably estimate the effect of this provision of the Tax Act.
21510_18_ITEM15_P246_S3	Therefore, we have not made any adjustments related to potential GILTI tax in our financial statements and have not made a policy decision regarding whether to record deferred tax on GILTI.
21510_18_ITEM15_P246_S4	We will make the accounting policy election after completion of the GILTI analysis in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
21510_18_ITEM15_P246_S5	The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations before income taxes for fiscal 2018 of 31.6% was higher than the effective U.S. federal blended rate of 24.5% .
21510_18_ITEM15_P246_S6	This was primarily due to the Tax Act's one-time mandatory deemed repatriation transition tax, the impact of income subject to foreign tax rates that are higher than the U.S. tax rates, the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the newly enacted U.S. federal tax rate of 21.0% , an accrual for foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes on certain foreign earnings not considered permanently reinvested, stock-based compensation not deductible for tax purposes and limitations on the deductibility of compensation under Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") Section 162(m).
21510_18_ITEM15_P246_S7	These amounts are partially offset by the excess tax benefits from stock award exercises and restricted stock unit vesting, the benefit of foreign tax credits, the benefit of federal research and development tax credits, the benefit of a domestic manufacturing deduction under IRC Section 199 and the Singapore tax exemption.
21510_18_ITEM15_P247_S0	In October 2016, Coherent Singapore received an amended Pioneer Status tax exemption from the Singapore authorities effective from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2021.
21510_18_ITEM15_P247_S1	The tax holiday continues to be conditional upon our meeting certain revenue, business spending and employment thresholds.
21510_18_ITEM15_P247_S2	The impact of this tax exemption decreased Singapore income taxes by approximately $2.5 million , $1.1 million and $0.7 million in fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively.
21510_18_ITEM15_P247_S3	The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in thousands):
21510_18_ITEM15_P248_S0	In determining our fiscal 2018 and 2017 tax provisions under ASC Subtopic 740, we calculated the deferred tax assets and liabilities for each separate tax entity.
21510_18_ITEM15_P249_S0	COHERENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 15.
21510_18_ITEM15_P250_S0	respect to our deferred tax assets.
21510_18_ITEM15_P250_S1	We determined that a valuation allowance was appropriate for a portion of the deferred tax assets of our California and certain state research and development tax credits, foreign tax attributes and foreign net operating losses at fiscal 2018 and 2017 year-ends.
21510_18_ITEM15_P250_S2	During fiscal 2018 , we increased our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by $5.0 million to $33.7 million , primarily due to the increase in California research and development tax credits and net operating losses generated from Rofin China, which are not expected to be recognized.
21510_18_ITEM15_P251_S0	The Company had U.S. federal deferred tax assets related to research and development credits, foreign tax credits and other tax attributes that can be used to offset federal taxable income in future periods.
21510_18_ITEM15_P251_S1	These credit carryforwards will expire if they are not used within certain time periods.
21510_18_ITEM15_P251_S2	As of September 29, 2018, management determined that there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will exist in the future allowing us to recognize these deferred tax assets.
21510_18_ITEM15_P252_S0	The net deferred tax asset is classified on the consolidated balance sheets as follows (in thousands):
21510_18_ITEM15_P253_S0	We have various tax attribute carryforwards which include the following:
21510_18_ITEM15_P254_S0	Foreign federal and local gross net operating loss carryforwards are $48.7 million , of which $37.4 million have no expiration date and $11.3 million have various expiration dates beginning in fiscal 2019 .
21510_18_ITEM15_P254_S1	Among the total of $48.7 million foreign net operating loss carryforwards, a valuation allowance of $9.9 million has been provided for certain jurisdictions since the recovery of the carryforwards are uncertain.
21510_18_ITEM15_P254_S2	U.S. federal and certain state gross net operating loss carryforwards are $8.3 million and $30.8 million , respectively, which were acquired from our Rofin acquisition.
21510_18_ITEM15_P254_S3	A full valuation allowance against certain other state net operating losses of $30.8 million has been recorded.
21510_18_ITEM15_P254_S4	California gross net operating loss carryforwards are $7.4 million and are scheduled to expire beginning in fiscal 2032 .
21510_18_ITEM15_P255_S0	U.S. federal R D credit carryforwards of $33.5 million are scheduled to expire beginning in fiscal 2025 .
21510_18_ITEM15_P255_S1	California R D credit carryforwards of $30.3 million have no expiration date.
21510_18_ITEM15_P255_S2	A total of $25.4 million valuation allowance, before U.S. federal benefit, has been recorded against California R D credit carryforwards of $30.3 million since the recovery of the carryforwards is uncertain.
21510_18_ITEM15_P255_S3	Other states R D credit carryforwards of $3.4 million are scheduled to expire beginning in fiscal 2019 .
21510_18_ITEM15_P255_S4	A valuation allowance totaling $2.8 million , before U.S. federal benefit, has been recorded against certain state R D credit carryforwards of $3.4 million since the recovery of the carryforwards is uncertain.
21510_18_ITEM15_P256_S0	U.S. federal foreign tax credit carryforwards of $13.0 million are scheduled to expire beginning in fiscal 2019 .
21510_18_ITEM15_P257_S0	We adopted ASU No. 2016-09 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
21510_18_ITEM15_P257_S1	As a result of adopting the new standard, excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation are now reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of the provision for income taxes.
21510_18_ITEM15_P257_S2	The adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 resulted in a decrease in our provision for income taxes of $12.8 million for fiscal 2018 due to the recognition of excess tax benefits for options exercised and the vesting of equity awards.
21510_18_ITEM15_P257_S3	We are subject to taxation and file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions.
21510_18_ITEM15_P257_S4	Our most significant tax jurisdictions are the U.S. and Germany.
21510_18_ITEM15_P257_S5	For U.S. federal and German income tax purposes, all years prior to fiscal 2015 and 2010, respectively, are closed to examination.
21510_18_ITEM15_P257_S6	In our other major foreign jurisdictions and our major state jurisdictions, the years prior to fiscal 2012 and 2014, respectively, are closed.
21510_18_ITEM15_P257_S7	Earlier years in our various jurisdictions may remain open for adjustment to the extent that we have tax attribute carryforwards from those years.
21510_18_ITEM15_P258_S0	In the U.S., a legacy Rofin entity is under audit for fiscal 2016.
21510_18_ITEM15_P258_S1	In Germany, various Coherent and legacy Rofin entities are under audit for the years 2010 through 2016.

21510_18_ITEM15_P260_S0	the amounts accrued for each year.
21510_18_ITEM15_P260_S1	Management believes that it has adequately provided for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.
21510_18_ITEM15_P261_S0	We regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions.
21510_18_ITEM15_P261_S1	Although the timing of resolution, settlement and closure of audits is not certain, we do not believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months.
21510_18_ITEM15_P261_S2	A reconciliation of the change in gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, is as follows (in thousands):
21510_18_ITEM15_P262_S0	As of September 29, 2018 , the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits including gross interest and penalties was $70.3 million , of which $50.4 million , if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate.
21510_18_ITEM15_P262_S1	Our total gross unrecognized tax benefit was classified as a long-term taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheets after reduction by certain deferred tax assets.
21510_18_ITEM15_P262_S2	We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes.
21510_18_ITEM15_P262_S3	As of September 29, 2018 , the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $4.4 million and it is classified as long-term taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheets.
21510_18_ITEM15_P262_S4	As of September 30, 2017 , we had accrued $2.8 million for the gross interest and penalties and it is classified as long-term taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheets.
21510_18_ITEM15_P262_S5	A summary of the fiscal tax years that remain subject to examination, as of September 29, 2018 , for our major tax jurisdictions is:
21510_18_ITEM15_P263_S0	SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION As a result of the acquisition of Rofin-Sinar Technologies Inc. ("Rofin") in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 (see discussion below), we reorganized our prior two reporting segments (Specialty Laser Systems and Commercial Lasers and Components) into two new reporting segments for the combined company: OEM Laser Sources ("OLS") and Industrial Lasers Systems ("ILS").
21510_18_ITEM15_P263_S1	This segment reorganization was based upon the organizational structure of the combined company and how the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") receives and utilizes information provided to allocate resources and make decisions.
21510_18_ITEM15_P263_S2	Accordingly, our segment information was restated retroactively in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
21510_18_ITEM15_P263_S3	This segmentation reflects the go-to-market strategies and synergies for our broad portfolio of laser technologies and products.
21510_18_ITEM15_P263_S4	While both segments deliver cost-effective, highly reliable photonics solutions, the OLS business segment is focused on high performance laser sources and complex optical sub-systems, typically used in microelectronics manufacturing, medical diagnostics and therapeutic medical applications, as well as in scientific research.
21510_18_ITEM15_P264_S0	Our ILS business segment delivers high performance laser sources, sub-systems and tools primarily used for industrial laser materials processing, serving important end markets like automotive, machine tool, consumer goods and medical device manufacturing.
21510_18_ITEM15_P264_S1	Rofin's operating results have been included primarily in our ILS segment.
21510_18_ITEM15_P264_S2	OR Laser's operating results have been included in our ILS segment.
21510_18_ITEM15_P265_S0	We have identified OLS and ILS as operating segments for which discrete financial information is available.
21510_18_ITEM15_P265_S1	Both units have dedicated engineering, manufacturing, product business management and product line management functions.
21510_18_ITEM15_P266_S0	A small portion of our outside revenue is attributable to projects and recently developed products for which a segment has not yet been determined.
21510_18_ITEM15_P267_S0	The associated direct and indirect costs are presented in the category of Corporate and other, along with other corporate costs as described below.

21510_18_ITEM15_P292_S2	Prior to actual distribution of Shares pursuant to any vested RSUs, such RSUs will represent an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable (if at all) only from the general assets of the Company.

21510_18_ITEM15_P295_S0	The performance metric is the relative performance of Company stock against the [ Applicable TSR Metric ] (the Index ) over a three-year period, with the target Company stock performance equivalent to the performance of the Index over such period.
21510_18_ITEM15_P295_S1	To determine relative performance, the baseline metrics are the 90 trading day average closing price of the Company and the Index, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, or such other reliable source as is determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion, with the last of the 90 trading days falling on [_____________, 20XX].
21510_18_ITEM15_P295_S2	This 90 day average establishes both the Company baseline stock price (the Company Baseline Stock Price ) and the Index baseline (the Index Baseline ) against which future Company stock and Index performance will be compared.

21510_18_ITEM15_P297_S0	The Company will then measure Company performance by dividing the Company Closing Price by the Company Baseline Stock Price, with the quotient expressed as a percentage of the Company Baseline Stock Price (the Company Percentage Performance ).

21510_18_ITEM15_P299_S0	Relative Performance Percentages shall result in incremental vesting on a straight-line basis within tiers based on full percentage Relative Performance Percentages as set forth below:

21510_18_ITEM15_P301_S1	Relative performance for such uncompleted performance period shall then be measured against the Index performance from the Index Baseline through the 90 trading day average closing price of the Index in the period ending on the date of the Change of Control.
21510_18_ITEM15_P301_S2	The Company s stock performance relative to the Index shall then be determined consistently with the methodology specified herein for completed performance period.
21510_18_ITEM15_P301_S3	The number of Shares subject to this RSU so determined shall then continue to vest based upon Employee s continuing as a Service Provider to the Company, the acquirer, or their Parents or Subsidiaries through [_____________, 20XX+3], subject to accelerated vesting as set forth in the Company s Change of Control Severance Plan (but only for participants in such plan), as amended from time to time.

21510_18_ITEM15_P336_S0	The Employee acknowledges and agrees that, regardless of any action taken by the Company or, if different, the Employee s employer (the Employer ), the ultimate liability for all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to the Employee s participation in the Plan and legally applicable to the Employee ( Tax-Related Items ) is and remains the Employee s responsibility and may exceed the amount (if any) withheld by the Company or the Employer.
21510_18_ITEM15_P336_S1	The Employee further acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the RSUs, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement of the RSUs, the receipt of any dividends on Shares, and the subsequent sale of the Shares; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the RSUs to reduce or eliminate the Employee s liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result.
21510_18_ITEM15_P336_S2	Further, if the Employee has become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, the Employee acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
21510_18_ITEM15_P336_S3	Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Employee will pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items.
21510_18_ITEM15_P336_S4	In this regard, the Company shall withhold in Shares otherwise deliverable to the Employee having a Fair Market Value equal to an amount that satisfies the Tax-Related Items required to be withheld.
21510_18_ITEM15_P336_S5	In the event that such withholding in Shares is problematic under applicable tax, securities or other laws, or has materially adverse accounting consequences, the Employee authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy their withholding obligations, if any, with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following: a. withholding from the Employee s wages or cash compensation paid to the Employee by the Company and/or the Employer; or b. withholding from proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired upon vesting/settlement of the RSUs either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on the Employee s behalf pursuant to this authorization without further consent).
21510_18_ITEM15_P336_S6	The Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering statutory withholding rates or other withholding rates, including maximum rates applicable in the Employee s jurisdiction, in which case the Employee may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the equivalent amount in Shares.
21510_18_ITEM15_P336_S7	If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, the Employee is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested RSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items .
21510_18_ITEM15_P336_S8	Finally, the Employee shall pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of the Employee s participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.
21510_18_ITEM15_P336_S9	The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares if the Employee fails to comply with the Employee s obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.
21510_18_ITEM15_P336_S10	Neither the Employee nor any person claiming under or through the Employee will have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any Shares deliverable hereunder unless and until certificates representing such Shares will have been issued, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Employee or the Employee s broker.
21510_18_ITEM15_P337_S0	In accepting the grant of RSUs, the Employee acknowledges, understands and agrees that: a. the Company (and not the Employee s employer) is granting the RSU.
21510_18_ITEM15_P337_S1	i. the grant of the RSUs, and all decisions with respect to any future grant of RSUs under the Plan, is at the complete discretion of the Company; j. the grant of the RSUs is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of Restricted Stock Units, or benefits in lieu of Restricted Stock Units, even if Restricted Stock Units have been granted in the past; k. the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature, and it may be modified, amended, suspended, or terminated by the Company at any time, to the extent permitted by the Plan; l. the grant of RSUs and the Employee s participation in the Plan shall not create a right to employment or other service or be interpreted as forming an employment or service contract with the Company and shall not interfere with the ability of the Employer to terminate the Employee s employment or other service relationship (if any) at any time; m. unless otherwise provided in the Plan or by the Company in its discretion, the RSUs and the benefits evidenced by this Agreement do not create any entitlement to have the RSUs or any such benefits transferred to, or assumed by, another company nor be exchanged, cashed out or substituted for, in connection with any corporate transaction affecting the Shares; and n. neither the Company, the Employer nor any Subsidiary shall be liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between the Employee s local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the RSUs or of any amounts due to the Employee pursuant to the settlement of the RSUs or the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired upon settlement.
21510_18_ITEM15_P338_S0	Data Privacy Information and Consent .
21510_18_ITEM15_P339_S0	The Company and the Employer may collect, process and use certain personal information about the Employee, including, but not limited to, the Employee s name, home address, telephone number, email address, date of birth, social insurance number, passport or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any Shares or directorships held in the Company, details of all awards granted under the Plan or any other entitlement to Shares awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in the Employee s favor ( Data ), for the purposes of implementing, administering and managing the Employee s participation in the Plan.
21510_18_ITEM15_P339_S1	The legal basis, where required, for the processing of Data is the Employee s consent.
21510_18_ITEM15_P340_S0	b. Stock Plan Administration Service Providers.
21510_18_ITEM15_P340_S1	The Company transfers Data to E*TRADE Financial Corporate Services, Inc. and certain of its affiliated companies ( E*TRADE ), an independent service provider based in the United States which is assisting the Company with the implementation, administration and management of the Plan.
21510_18_ITEM15_P340_S2	The Company may select a different service provider or additional service providers and share Data with such other provider serving in a similar manner.
21510_18_ITEM15_P340_S3	The Employee may be asked to agree on separate terms and data processing practices with the service provider, with such agreement being a condition to the ability to participate in the Plan.
21510_18_ITEM15_P341_S0	The Company and E*TRADE are based in the United States.
21510_18_ITEM15_P341_S1	The Employee s country or jurisdiction may have different data privacy laws and protections than the United States.
21510_18_ITEM15_P341_S2	For example, the European Commission has issued a limited adequacy finding with respect to the United States that applies only to the extent companies register for the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield program.
21510_18_ITEM15_P341_S3	The Company has certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Program and relies on it for its transfer of Data from European Union countries to the U.S.
21510_18_ITEM15_P341_S4	Elsewhere, its legal basis for the transfer of Data, where required, is the Employee s consent.
21510_18_ITEM15_P341_S5	The Company will hold and use Data only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage the Employee s participation in the Plan, or as required to comply with legal or regulatory obligations, including under tax and security laws.

21510_18_ITEM15_P342_S1	Participation in the Plan is voluntary and the Employee is providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis.
21510_18_ITEM15_P342_S2	If the Employee does not consent, or if the Employee later seeks to revoke the consent, his or her salary from or employment with the Employer will not be affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing the consent is that the Company would not be able to grant the Employee awards under the Plan or administer or maintain such awards.
21510_18_ITEM15_P343_S0	The Employee may have a number of rights under data privacy laws in his or her jurisdiction.
21510_18_ITEM15_P343_S1	Depending on where the Employee is based, such rights may include the right to (i) request access to or copies of Data the Company processes, (ii) rectify incorrect Data, (iii) delete Data, (iv) restrict the processing of Data, (v) restrict the portability of Data, (vi) lodge complaints with competent authorities in the Employee s jurisdiction, and/or (vii) receive a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of Data.
21510_18_ITEM15_P343_S2	To receive clarification regarding these rights or to exercise these rights, the Employee can contact his or her local human resources representative.
21510_18_ITEM15_P343_S3	The Employee understands that the Company may rely on a different legal basis for the collection, processing or transfer of Data in the future and/or request the Employee to provide another data privacy consent.
21510_18_ITEM15_P343_S4	If applicable, upon request of the Company or the Employer, the Employee agrees to provide an executed data privacy consent form to the Company and/or the Employer (or any other agreements or consents that may be required by the Company and/or the Employer) that the Company and/or the Employer may deem necessary to obtain from the Employee for the purpose of administering his or her participation in the Plan in compliance with the applicable data privacy laws, either now or in the future.
21510_18_ITEM15_P343_S5	The Employee understands and agrees that he or she will not be able to participate in the Plan if he or she fails to provide any such consent or agreement requested by the Company and/or the Employer. 10.
21510_18_ITEM15_P343_S6	The Company is not providing any tax, legal, or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding the Employee s participation in the Plan or the Employee s acquisition or sale of Shares.
21510_18_ITEM15_P343_S7	The Employee should therefore consult with his or her own personal tax, legal, and financial advisors regarding the Employee s participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan. 11.

21510_18_ITEM15_P345_S0	This Agreement is subject to all terms and provisions of the Plan.
21510_18_ITEM15_P345_S1	In the event of a conflict between one or more provisions of this Agreement and one or more provisions of the Plan, the provisions of the Plan shall govern.
21510_18_ITEM15_P345_S2	Captions provided herein are for convenience only and are not to serve as a basis for interpretation or construction of this Agreement.
21510_18_ITEM15_P345_S3	In the event that any provision in this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be severable from, and such invalidity or unenforceability shall not be construed to have any effect on, the remaining provisions of this Agreement.
21510_18_ITEM15_P346_S0	This Agreement (including any appendices attached hereto) constitutes the entire understanding of the parties on the subjects covered.
21510_18_ITEM15_P346_S1	The Employee expressly warrants that he or she is not executing this Agreement in reliance on any promises, representations, or inducements other than those contained herein.
21510_18_ITEM15_P346_S2	Subject to paragraph 21 below, modifications to this Agreement or the Plan can be made only in an express written contract executed by a duly authorized officer of the Company.
21510_18_ITEM15_P346_S3	The RSU grant and the provisions of this Agreement will be governed by, and subject to, the internal substantive laws, but not the choice of law rules, of the State of California.
21510_18_ITEM15_P347_S0	For purposes of litigating any dispute that arises directly or indirectly from the relationship of the parties evidenced by the grant or this Agreement, the parties hereby submit to and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of California and agree that such litigation shall be conducted only in the courts of Santa Clara County, California, or the federal courts for the United States for the Northern District of California, and no other courts, where this grant is made and/or to be performed.
21510_18_ITEM15_P348_S0	Notwithstanding any provisions in this Agreement, the RSU grant shall be subject to any special terms and conditions set forth in the Appendix for the Employee s country.
21510_18_ITEM15_P348_S1	Moreover, if the Employee relocates to one of the countries included in the Appendix, the special terms and conditions for such country will apply to the extent the Company determines that the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons.
21510_18_ITEM15_P348_S2	The Appendix constitutes part of this Agreement.
21510_18_ITEM15_P348_S3	The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on the Employee s participation in the Plan, on the RSUs, and on any Shares acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons, and to require the Employee to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.

21510_18_ITEM15_P349_S1	By participating in the Plan, the Employee agrees to comply with the Company s policy on insider trading (to the extent that it is applicable to the Employee).
21510_18_ITEM15_P349_S2	The Employee acknowledges that, depending on his or her country or the broker s country, or the country in which the Shares are listed, the Employee may be subject to insider trading restrictions and/or market abuse laws in applicable jurisdictions, which may affect his or her ability to accept, acquire, sell or attempt to sell, or otherwise dispose of the Shares, rights to Shares ( e.g. , the RSUs) or rights linked to the value of Shares, during such times as the Employee is considered to have inside information regarding the Company (as defined by the laws or regulations in applicable jurisdictions, including the United States and, if different, the Employee s country).
21510_18_ITEM15_P349_S3	Local insider trading laws and regulations may prohibit the cancellation or amendment of orders the Employee placed before possessing inside information.
21510_18_ITEM15_P349_S4	Furthermore, the Employee may be prohibited from (i) disclosing insider information to any third party, including fellow employees or service providers (other than on a need-to-know basis) and (ii) tipping third parties or causing them to otherwise buy or sell securities.
21510_18_ITEM15_P349_S5	Any restrictions under these laws or regulations are separate from and in addition to any restrictions that may be imposed under any applicable Company insider trading policy.
21510_18_ITEM15_P349_S6	The Employee acknowledges that it is the Employee s responsibility to comply with any applicable restrictions, and the Employee should speak to his or her personal advisor on this matter.
21510_18_ITEM15_P350_S0	The Employee acknowledges that there may be certain foreign asset and/or account reporting requirements which may affect his or her ability to acquire or hold the Shares acquired under the Plan or cash received from participating in the Plan (including from any dividends paid on the Shares) in a brokerage or bank account outside his or her country.

21510_18_ITEM15_P351_S0	The Employee acknowledges that a waiver by the Company of breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement, or of any subsequent breach by the Employee or any other Participants.
21510_18_ITEM15_P352_S0	Certain capitalized terms used but not defined in this Appendix have the meanings set forth in the Plan, the Notice of Grant and/or the Global Restricted Stock Unit Agreement.
21510_18_ITEM15_P352_S1	TERMS AND CONDITIONS This Appendix includes additional terms and conditions that govern the RSUs granted to the Employee under the Plan if the Employee works and/or resides in one of the countries listed below.
21510_18_ITEM15_P352_S2	These terms and conditions are in addition to or, if so indicated, in place of, the terms and conditions set forth in the Global Restricted Stock Unit Agreement.
21510_18_ITEM15_P352_S3	If the Employee is a citizen or resident of a country other than that in which he or she is currently working and/or residing (or is considered as such for local law purposes) or if the Employee transfers his or her service relationship and/or residence to another country after the RSUs are granted, the Company shall, in its discretion, determine to what extent the terms and conditions contained herein shall be applicable to the Employee.
21510_18_ITEM15_P352_S4	NOTIFICATIONS This Appendix also includes information regarding certain other issues of which the Employee should be aware with respect to the Employee s participation in the Plan.
21510_18_ITEM15_P352_S5	Such information is based on the securities, exchange control and other laws in effect in the respective countries as of [_______, 20XX].
21510_18_ITEM15_P352_S6	Such laws are often complex and change frequently.
21510_18_ITEM15_P352_S7	As a result, the Company strongly recommends that the Employee not rely on the information contained in this Appendix as the only source of information relating to the consequences of the Employee s participation in the Plan, because the information may be out-of-date at the time the Employee vests in the RSUs or sells any Shares acquired upon settlement.
21510_18_ITEM15_P352_S8	In addition, the information contained in this Appendix is general in nature and may not apply to the Employee s particular situation.
21510_18_ITEM15_P352_S9	As a result, the Company is not in a position to assure the Employee of any particular result.
21510_18_ITEM15_P352_S10	Accordingly, the Employee should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in the Employee s country may apply to the Employee s individual situation.
21510_18_ITEM15_P352_S11	If the Employee is a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which the Employee is currently residing and/or working, is considered a resident of another country or transfers his or her service relationship and/or residency to another country after the RSUs are granted, the information contained in this Appendix may not be applicable to the Employee in the same manner.
21510_18_ITEM15_P353_S0	The Company hereby grants to the Employee named in the Notice of Grant of Award and Award Agreement (the Notice of Grant ) an award of Restricted Stock Units ( PRSUs ), as set forth in the Notice of Grant, subject to the terms and conditions in this agreement, including any special terms and conditions for the Employee s country contained in the appendix attached hereto (the Appendix and, together with the Global Performance Restricted Stock Unit Agreement, the Agreement ) and in the Company s 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan ).
21510_18_ITEM15_P353_S1	Capitalized terms used and not defined in this Agreement shall have the meaning set forth in the Plan.
21510_18_ITEM15_P354_S0	Each PRSU granted represents the right to receive one Share on the vesting date.
21510_18_ITEM15_P354_S1	Unless and until the PRSUs vest, the Employee will have no right to receive Shares under such PRSUs.
21510_18_ITEM15_P354_S2	Prior to actual distribution of Shares pursuant to any vested PRSUs, such PRSUs will represent an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable (if at all) only from the general assets of the Company.
21510_18_ITEM15_P355_S0	Vesting Schedule; Assumption or Substitution Calculation .
21510_18_ITEM15_P355_S1	The PRSUs shall vest as follows:
21510_18_ITEM15_P356_S0	Up to the Maximum Amount will vest and be settled, based upon the extent, if any, to which the performance metric has been achieved.
21510_18_ITEM15_P357_S0	The performance metric is the relative performance of Company stock against the [ Applicable TSR Metric ] (the Index ) over a three-year period, with the target Company stock performance equivalent to the performance of the Index over such period.
21510_18_ITEM15_P357_S1	To determine relative performance, the baseline metrics are the 90 trading day average closing price of the Company and the Index, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, or such other reliable source as is determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion, with the last of the 90 trading days falling on [_____________, 20XX].
21510_18_ITEM15_P357_S2	This 90 day average establishes both the Company baseline stock price (the Company Baseline Stock Price ) and the Index baseline (the Index Baseline ) against which future Company stock and Index performance will be compared.
21510_18_ITEM15_P358_S0	Next, the Company will measure the 90 trading day average closing price of the Company and the Index, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, or such other reliable source as is determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion, with the last trading day of such 90-trading day period ending on [_____________, 20XX+3] (establishing both the Company Closing Price and the Index Closing Price ).
21510_18_ITEM15_P359_S0	The Company will then measure Company performance by dividing the Company Closing Price by the Company Baseline Stock Price, with the quotient expressed as a percentage of the Company Baseline Stock Price (the Company Percentage Performance ).
21510_18_ITEM15_P359_S1	The Company will then measure Index Performance over the same period by dividing the Index Closing Price by the Index Baseline with the quotient expressed as a percentage of the Index Baseline (the Index Percentage Performance ).
21510_18_ITEM15_P360_S0	The Company will then subtract the Index Percentage Performance from the Company Percentage Performance, then add 100 to the result, with the final result constituting the relative Company performance as a percentage (the Relative Performance Percentage ).
21510_18_ITEM15_P361_S0	Relative Performance Percentages shall result in incremental vesting on a straight-line basis within tiers based on full percentage Relative Performance Percentages as set forth below:
21510_18_ITEM15_P362_S0	The Company Closing Price shall be automatically adjusted to account for any Company stock split or similar change in capitalization effected without receipt of consideration by the Company set forth in Plan Section 19(a) in the same manner as set forth in Plan Section 19(a).
21510_18_ITEM15_P362_S1	In making determinations of the number of Shares that vest hereunder, all Relative Performance Percentage fractional percentages and Share numbers below .5 shall be rounded down to the nearest whole percentage or Share number, respectively and all Relative Performance Percentage fractional percentages and Share numbers of .5 or greater shall be rounded up to the nearest whole percentage or Share number, respectively.
21510_18_ITEM15_P362_S2	All vesting and delivery of Shares hereunder, except pursuant to assumed or substituted awards in a change of control as specified in the following paragraph, shall be subject to the prior written or electronic certification of the Compensation Committee of the Board as to the extent to which the applicable performance milestones have been achieved.
21510_18_ITEM15_P363_S0	In the event the Company is acquired in a merger or asset sale pursuant to which this PRSU is assumed or substituted pursuant to Plan Section 19(c) (a Change of Control ), then if the performance period has not been completed as of the date of the Change of Control, the Company Closing Price shall be deemed to be the price per share received by the Company s stockholders in the Change of Control.
21510_18_ITEM15_P363_S1	Relative performance for such uncompleted performance period shall then be measured against the Index performance from the Index Baseline through the 90 trading day average closing price of the Index in the period ending on the date of the Change of Control.
21510_18_ITEM15_P363_S2	The Company s stock performance relative to the Index shall then be determined consistently with the methodology specified herein for completed performance period.
21510_18_ITEM15_P363_S3	The number of Shares subject to this PRSU so determined shall then continue to vest based upon Employee s continuing as a Service Provider to the Company, the acquirer, or their Parents or Subsidiaries through [_____________, 20XX+3], subject to accelerated vesting as set forth in the Company s Change of Control Severance Plan (but only for participants in such plan), as amended from time to time.
21510_18_ITEM15_P364_S0	Forfeiture upon Termination as a Service Provider .
21510_18_ITEM15_P364_S1	Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement or the Notice of Grant, if the Employee terminates service as a Service Provider for any or no reason prior to vesting, the unvested PRSUs awarded by this Agreement will thereupon be forfeited at no cost to the Company, subject to accelerated vesting as set forth in the Company s Change of Control Severance Plan (but only for participants in such plan), as amended from time to time.
21510_18_ITEM15_P364_S2	For purposes of the PRSUs, the Service Provider s service will be considered terminated as of the date that the Service Provider is no longer providing services to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries (regardless of the reason for such termination and whether or not later to be found invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where the Employee is employed), and unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the Service Provider s employment agreement or the Company s Change of Control Severance Plan (but only for participants in such plan), the Service Provider s right to vest in the PRSUs under the Plan, if any, will terminate as of such date and will not be extended by any notice period ( e.g. , the Employee s period of service would not include any contractual notice period or any period of garden leave or similar period mandated under employment laws in the jurisdiction where the Employee is employed); the Company shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when the Service Provider is no longer providing services for purposes of the PRSUs (including whether the Service Provider may still be considered to be providing services while on a leave of absence).
21510_18_ITEM15_P365_S0	Any PRSUs that vest in accordance with paragraph 3 will be distributed to the Employee (or in the event of the Employee s death, to his or her estate) in Shares.
21510_18_ITEM15_P366_S0	T he Employee acknowledges and agrees that, regardless of any action taken by the Company or, if different, the Employee s employer (the Employer ), the ultimate liability for all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to the Employee s participation in the Plan and legally applicable to the Employee ( Tax-Related Items ) is and remains the Employee s responsibility and may exceed the amount (if any) withheld by the Company or the Employer.
21510_18_ITEM15_P366_S1	The Employee further acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the PRSUs, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement of the PRSUs, the receipt of any dividends on Shares, and the subsequent sale of the Shares; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the PRSUs to reduce or eliminate the Employee s liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result.
21510_18_ITEM15_P366_S2	Further, if the Employee has become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, the Employee acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
21510_18_ITEM15_P367_S0	Notwithstanding paragraph 5, prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Employee will pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items.
21510_18_ITEM15_P367_S1	In this regard, the Company shall withhold in Shares otherwise deliverable to the Employee having a Fair Market Value equal to an amount that satisfies the Tax-Related Items required to be withheld.
21510_18_ITEM15_P367_S2	In the event that such withholding in Shares is problematic under applicable tax, securities, or other laws or has materially adverse accounting consequences, the Employee authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy their withholding obligations, if any, with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following: a. withholding from the Employee s wages or cash compensation paid to the Employee by the Company and/or the Employer; or b. withholding from proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired upon vesting/settlement of the PRSUs either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on the Employee s behalf pursuant to this authorization without further consent).
21510_18_ITEM15_P367_S3	The Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering statutory withholding rates or other withholding rates, including maximum rates applicable in the Employee s jurisdiction, in which case the Employee may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the equivalent amount in Shares.
21510_18_ITEM15_P367_S4	If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, the Employee is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested PRSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items .
21510_18_ITEM15_P367_S5	Finally, the Employee shall pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of the Employee s participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.
21510_18_ITEM15_P367_S6	The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares if the Employee fails to comply with the Employee s obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.
21510_18_ITEM15_P368_S0	Neither the Employee nor any person claiming under or through the Employee will have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any Shares deliverable hereunder unless and until certificates representing such Shares will have been issued, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Employee or the Employee s broker.
21510_18_ITEM15_P369_S0	In accepting the grant of PRSUs, the Employee acknowledges, understands and agrees that:
21510_18_ITEM15_P370_S0	a. the Company (and not the Employee s employer) is granting the PRSU.
21510_18_ITEM15_P371_S0	n. neither the Company, the Employer nor any Subsidiary shall be liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between the Employee s local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the PRSUs or of any amounts due to the Employee pursuant to the settlement of the PRSUs or the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired upon settlement.
21510_18_ITEM15_P372_S0	Data Privacy Information and Consent .
21510_18_ITEM15_P373_S0	The Company and the Employer may collect, process and use certain personal information about the Employee, including, but not limited to, the Employee s name, home address, telephone number, email address, date of birth, social insurance number, passport or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any Shares or directorships held in the Company, details of all awards granted under the Plan or any other entitlement to Shares awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in the Employee s favor ( Data ), for the purposes of implementing, administering and managing the Employee s participation in the Plan.
21510_18_ITEM15_P373_S1	The legal basis, where required, for the processing of Data is the Employee s consent.
21510_18_ITEM15_P374_S0	b. Stock Plan Administration Service Providers.
21510_18_ITEM15_P374_S1	The Company transfers Data to E*TRADE Financial Corporate Services, Inc. and certain of its affiliated companies ( E*TRADE ), an independent service provider based in the United States which is assisting the Company with the implementation, administration and management of the Plan.
21510_18_ITEM15_P374_S2	The Company may select a different service provider or additional service providers and share Data with such other provider serving in a similar manner.
21510_18_ITEM15_P374_S3	The Employee may be asked to agree on separate terms and data processing practices with the service provider, with such agreement being a condition to the ability to participate in the Plan.
21510_18_ITEM15_P375_S0	The Company and E*TRADE are based in the United States.
21510_18_ITEM15_P375_S1	The Employee s country or jurisdiction may have different data privacy laws and protections than the United States.
21510_18_ITEM15_P375_S2	For example, the European Commission has issued a limited adequacy finding with respect to the United States that applies only to the extent companies register for the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield program.
21510_18_ITEM15_P375_S3	The Company has certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Program and relies on it for its transfer of Data from European Union countries to the U.S.
21510_18_ITEM15_P375_S4	Elsewhere, its legal basis for the transfer of Data, where required, is the Employee s consent.
21510_18_ITEM15_P376_S0	The Company will hold and use Data only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage the Employee s participation in the Plan, or as required to comply with legal or regulatory obligations, including under tax and security laws.
21510_18_ITEM15_P377_S0	e. Voluntariness and Consequences of Consent Denial or Withdrawal.
21510_18_ITEM15_P377_S1	Participation in the Plan is voluntary and the Employee is providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis.
21510_18_ITEM15_P377_S2	If the Employee does not consent, or if the Employee later seeks to revoke the consent, his or her salary from or employment with the Employer will not be affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing the consent is that the Company would not be able to grant the Employee awards under the Plan or administer or maintain such awards.
21510_18_ITEM15_P378_S0	The Employee may have a number of rights under data privacy laws in his or her jurisdiction.
21510_18_ITEM15_P378_S1	Depending on where the Employee is based, such rights may include the right to (i) request access to or copies of Data the Company processes, (ii) rectify incorrect Data, (iii) delete Data, (iv) restrict the processing of Data, (v) restrict the portability of Data, (vi) lodge complaints with competent authorities in the Employee s jurisdiction, and/or (vii) receive a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of Data.
21510_18_ITEM15_P378_S2	To receive clarification regarding these rights or to exercise these rights, the Employee can contact his or her local human resources representative.
21510_18_ITEM15_P379_S0	The Employee understands that the Company may rely on a different legal basis for the collection, processing or transfer of Data in the future and/or request the Employee to provide another data privacy consent.
21510_18_ITEM15_P379_S1	If applicable, upon request of the Company or the Employer, the Employee agrees to provide an executed data privacy consent form to the Company and/or the Employer (or any other agreements or consents that may be required by the Company and/or the Employer) that the Company and/or the Employer may deem necessary to obtain from the Employee for the purpose of administering his or her participation in the Plan in compliance with the applicable data privacy laws, either now or in the future.
21510_18_ITEM15_P379_S2	The Employee understands and agrees that he or she will not be able to participate in the Plan if he or she fails to provide any such consent or agreement requested by the Company and/or the Employer.
21510_18_ITEM15_P380_S0	The Company is not providing any tax, legal, or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding the Employee s participation in the Plan or the Employee s acquisition or sale of the Shares.
21510_18_ITEM15_P380_S1	The Employee should therefore consult with his or her own personal tax, legal, and financial advisors regarding the Employee s participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan.
21510_18_ITEM15_P381_S0	The Employee has received the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any other related communications, and the Employee consents to having received these documents, in English.

21510_18_ITEM15_P382_S0	The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to current or future participation in the Plan by electronic means.
21510_18_ITEM15_P382_S1	The Employee hereby consents to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agrees to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or a third party designated by the Company.

21510_18_ITEM15_P385_S1	In the event of a conflict between one or more provisions of this Agreement and one or more provisions of the Plan, the provisions of the Plan shall govern.
21510_18_ITEM15_P386_S0	Captions provided herein are for convenience only and are not to serve as a basis for interpretation or construction of this Agreement.
21510_18_ITEM15_P387_S0	In the event that any provision in this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be severable from, and such invalidity or unenforceability shall not be construed to have any effect on, the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

21510_18_ITEM15_P388_S1	The Employee expressly warrants that he or she is not executing this Agreement in reliance on any promises, representations, or inducements other than those contained herein.
21510_18_ITEM15_P388_S2	Subject to paragraph 21 below, modifications to this Agreement or the Plan can be made only in an express written contract executed by a duly authorized officer of the Company.
21510_18_ITEM15_P389_S0	The PRSU grant and the provisions of this Agreement will be governed by, and subject to, the internal substantive laws, but not the choice of law rules, of the State of California.
21510_18_ITEM15_P390_S0	For purposes of litigating any dispute that arises directly or indirectly from the relationship of the parties evidenced by the grant or this Agreement, the parties hereby submit to and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of California and agree that such litigation shall be conducted only in the courts of Santa Clara County, California, or the federal courts for the United States for the Northern District of California, and no other courts, where this grant is made and/or to be performed.

21510_18_ITEM15_P391_S1	Moreover, if the Employee relocates to one of the countries included in the Appendix, the special terms and conditions for such country will apply to the extent the Company determines that the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons.
21510_18_ITEM15_P391_S2	The Appendix constitutes part of this Agreement.
21510_18_ITEM15_P392_S0	The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on the Employee s participation in the Plan, on the PRSUs, and on any Shares acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons, and to require the Employee to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.
21510_18_ITEM15_P393_S0	By participating in the Plan, the Employee agrees to comply with the Company s policy on insider trading (to the extent that it is applicable to the Employee).
21510_18_ITEM15_P393_S1	The Employee acknowledges that, depending on his or her country or the broker s country, or the country in which the Shares are listed, the Employee may be subject to insider trading restrictions and/or market abuse laws in applicable jurisdictions, which may affect his or her ability to accept, acquire, sell or attempt to sell, or otherwise dispose of the Shares, rights to Shares (e.g., the PRSUs) or rights linked to the value of Shares, during such times as the Employee is considered to have inside information regarding the Company (as defined by the laws or regulations in applicable jurisdictions, including the United States and, if different, the Employee s country).
21510_18_ITEM15_P393_S2	Local insider trading laws and regulations may prohibit the cancellation or amendment of orders the Employee placed before possessing inside information.
21510_18_ITEM15_P393_S3	Furthermore, the Employee may be prohibited from (i) disclosing insider information to any third party, including fellow employees or service providers (other than on a need-to-know basis) and (ii) tipping third parties or causing them to otherwise buy or sell securities.
21510_18_ITEM15_P393_S4	Any restrictions under these laws or regulations are separate from and in addition to any restrictions that may be imposed under any applicable Company insider trading policy.
21510_18_ITEM15_P393_S5	The Employee acknowledges that it is the Employee s responsibility to comply with any applicable restrictions, and the Employee should speak to his or her personal advisor on this matter.
21510_18_ITEM15_P394_S0	Foreign Asset/ Account Reporting Requirements .
21510_18_ITEM15_P394_S1	T he Employee acknowledges that there may be certain foreign asset and/or account reporting requirements which may affect his or her ability to acquire or hold the Shares acquired under the Plan or cash received from participating in the Plan (including from any dividends paid on the Shares) in a brokerage or bank account outside his or her country.
21510_18_ITEM15_P394_S2	The Employee may be required to report such accounts, assets or transactions to the tax or other authorities in his or her country.

21510_18_ITEM15_P396_S2	These terms and conditions are in addition to or, if so indicated, in place of, the terms and conditions set forth in the Global Restricted Stock Unit Agreement.
21510_18_ITEM15_P396_S3	If the Employee is a citizen or resident of a country other than that in which he or she is currently working and/or residing (or is considered as such for local law purposes) or if the Employee transfers his or her service relationship and/or residence to another country after the PRSUs are granted, the Company shall, in its discretion, determine to what extent the terms and conditions contained herein shall be applicable to the Employee.
21510_18_ITEM15_P396_S4	NOTIFICATIONS This Appendix also includes information regarding certain other issues of which the Employee should be aware with respect to the Employee s participation in the Plan.
21510_18_ITEM15_P396_S5	Such information is based on the securities, exchange control and other laws in effect in the respective countries as of [_______, 20XX].
21510_18_ITEM15_P396_S6	Such laws are often complex and change frequently.
21510_18_ITEM15_P396_S7	As a result, the Company strongly recommends that the Employee not rely on the information contained in this Appendix as the only source of information relating to the consequences of the Employee s participation in the Plan, because the information may be out-of-date at the time the Employee vests in the PRSUs or sells any Shares acquired upon settlement.
