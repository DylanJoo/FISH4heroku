202947_11_ITEM1_P0_S0	The Company was organized as a business corporation under the laws of Rhode Island in 1983 as Providence and Worcester Company and is the successor by merger in 1983 to a corporation also named Providence and Worcester Company which was organized under the laws of Delaware in 1979.
202947_11_ITEM1_P0_S1	In 1984, the Company s name was changed to Capital Properties, Inc.
202947_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	The current economic conditions have had limited impact on the Company s results of operations to date.
202947_11_ITEM1_P1_S1	In 2009, the Company granted rent concessions to two tenants of its leasing segment, which concessions terminated July 1, 2010, for a total increase of $93,000 annually.
202947_11_ITEM1_P1_S2	As none of the Company s leases require the tenant to provide financial information, the Company has no information concerning the impact of current economic conditions on its major tenants and, therefore, cannot predict whether any other tenants will request rent relief or concessions.
202947_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	The Company operates in two segments: leasing and petroleum storage.
202947_11_ITEM1_P2_S1	For financial information, see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
202947_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	The leasing segment is principally devoted to the leasing of Company-owned land in the Capital Center area ( Capital Center ) in downtown Providence, Rhode Island under long-term ground leases.
202947_11_ITEM1_P3_S1	The Company owns approximately 18 acres in the Capital Center consisting of 11 individual parcels.
202947_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	The Capital Center (approximately 77 acres of land) is the result of a development project undertaken by the State of Rhode Island, the City of Providence, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation ( Amtrak ) and the Company during the 1980 s in which two rivers, the Moshassuck and the Woonasquatucket, were moved, Amtrak s Northeast Corridor rail was relocated, a new railroad station (the Railroad Station ) was constructed and significant public improvements were made to improve pedestrian and vehicular traffic in the area.
202947_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	With the exception of the Steeple Street property, the Company has not acted, and does not intend to act, as a developer with respect to any improvements constructed on Company-owned parcels.
202947_11_ITEM1_P5_S1	Rather, the Company offers individual parcels for lease pursuant to long-term ground leases with terms of 99 years or more.
202947_11_ITEM1_P5_S2	Each lease contains provisions permitting the tenant to develop the parcel under certain terms and conditions.
202947_11_ITEM1_P5_S3	Each lease provides for periodic rent adjustments of various kinds.
202947_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	Each tenant is required to indemnify the Company with respect to all of the tenant s activities on the land.
202947_11_ITEM1_P6_S1	The leases contain other terms and conditions customary to such instruments.
202947_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	As part of the construction of the Railroad Station, the Federal Railroad Administration constructed a 330-car parking garage on the Company s land adjacent to the Railroad Station, and the Company paid one-half of the construction cost.
202947_11_ITEM1_P7_S1	Subsequently, the Company became the sole owner of the parking garage.
202947_11_ITEM1_P7_S2	In 2005, the Company sold the parking garage for $2,500,000 in cash and leased the underlying land to the buyer for 99 years at an initial annual contractual rental of $100,000.
202947_11_ITEM1_P7_S3	Under the lease the buyer is responsible for all real estate taxes and other expenses relating to the parking garage.
202947_11_ITEM1_P7_S4	The sale of the parking garage, while retaining title to the underlying land, is consistent with the Company s policy not to act as a developer with respect to improvements constructed on land that it currently owns or may hereafter acquire.
202947_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	The Company first began offering parcels for lease in the Capital Center area in the late 1980 s.
202947_11_ITEM1_P8_S1	As of December 31, 2010, six developed parcels have been leased by the Company under long-term leases of 99 years or more.
202947_11_ITEM1_P8_S2	Located on these parcels are the following:
202947_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	In addition, in 2005 a long-term land lease commenced on an undeveloped parcel on which two residential buildings were planned.
202947_11_ITEM1_P9_S1	One building containing 96 apartments (120,000 gross square feet) was completed in September 2009.
202947_11_ITEM1_P9_S2	The other building has not progressed beyond the early stages of site preparation, and the timing of construction and completion is uncertain.
202947_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	While seeking developers, the Company also leases Parcels 3E, 3W, 4E and 4W in the Capital Center area for public parking purposes on a short-term basis to Metropark, Ltd.
202947_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	Since the 1980 s, the Company has owned an undeveloped parcel of land adjacent to the Capital Center containing 20,600 square feet, which is leased out for public parking purposes on a short-term basis.
202947_11_ITEM1_P11_S1	In 2007, the Company purchased the adjacent parcel containing a three/four-story 18,000 square foot building (the Steeple Street Building ) and related land for $2,329,000, which, with the previously-owned land, now comprises Parcel 20.
202947_11_ITEM1_P11_S2	The Steeple Street Building is on the State Registry of Historic Buildings.
202947_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	At the time of acquisition, the Steeple Street Building had both residential and commercial tenants.
202947_11_ITEM1_P12_S1	It now has two commercial tenants.
202947_11_ITEM1_P12_S2	While seeking a developer for the entire 26,600 square foot parcel, in June 2009 the Company commenced the construction of the historic restoration and utility infrastructure of the building, which was completed in December 2010, at a total cost of $3,178,000 plus tenant improvements of $191,000.
202947_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	All of the properties described above are shown on a map contained in Exhibit 20.1.
202947_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	The Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, leases certain outdoor advertising locations along interstate and primary highways in Rhode Island and Massachusetts to Lamar under a lease which expires in 2033.
202947_11_ITEM1_P14_S1	Presently, there are 24 locations under lease, containing 46 billboard faces.
202947_11_ITEM1_P14_S2	Of these locations, 22 are controlled by the Company through permanent easements granted to the Company pursuant to an agreement between the Company and Providence Worcester Railroad Company, a related company ( Railroad ), and two are leased by the Company from third parties under leases with remaining terms of five years or less.
202947_11_ITEM1_P14_S3	The term of the Lamar lease is extended for two years for each additional location added.
202947_11_ITEM1_P14_S4	Although no new locations have been added since 2002, one structure was moved to a different location and the lease was extended for two years.
202947_11_ITEM1_P14_S5	Lamar has a right of first refusal for additional billboard location sites acquired by the Company in New England and Metropolitan New York City.
202947_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	by the sum of (a) commissions paid to third parties and (b) the base monthly rent for each leased billboard display for such 12-month period.
202947_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	In all other respects, the lease remains substantially unchanged.
202947_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	The Company has the right to require the Railroad to grant to it additional permanent easements for the location of billboards along the Railroad s right-of-way on commercially reasonable terms.
202947_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	A summary of the long-term leases which have commenced is as follows:
202947_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	The following table sets forth those major tenants whose revenues exceed 10% of the Company s leasing segment revenues:
202947_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	The Company competes for tenants with other owners of undeveloped real property in downtown Providence.
202947_11_ITEM1_P19_S1	The Company maintains no listing of other competitive properties and will not engage in a competitive bid arrangement with proposed developers.
202947_11_ITEM1_P19_S2	The Company s refusal to sell the land that it owns may restrict the number of interested developers.
202947_11_ITEM1_P19_S3	As to the Steeple Street Building, the Company competes for tenants with other office and commercial buildings located in downtown Providence.
202947_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	The leasing segment has two employees.
202947_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	The Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Dunellen, LLC, owns a petroleum storage terminal with a capacity of approximately 1,000,000 barrels (the Terminal ) and the Wilkesbarre Pier (the Pier ), collectively referred to as the Facility, located in East Providence, Rhode Island.
202947_11_ITEM1_P21_S1	The Facility is leased to Global Companies, LLC ( Global ) for the storage and sale of petroleum distillates.
202947_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	The Terminal utilizes the Pier and pipelines connecting the Pier to the Terminal.
202947_11_ITEM1_P22_S1	The Company operates the Facility for Global pursuant to a contract with another Company subsidiary, Capital Terminal Company.
202947_11_ITEM1_P22_S2	The lease provides for a fixed monthly rent which is subject to annual cost-of-living adjustments.
202947_11_ITEM1_P22_S3	The lease expires April 30, 2013, but will continue thereafter on a year-to-year basis unless terminated by either party upon ninety days written notice.
202947_11_ITEM1_P22_S4	Global may terminate the lease on the anniversary date (April 30) provided it gives at least one year s written notice.
202947_11_ITEM1_P22_S5	The lease includes provisions for additional payments based upon petroleum throughput in any twelve-month period beginning on May 1 of each year and ending on April 30 of the subsequent year at the rate of $.10 per barrel for every barrel in excess of 4,000,000 barrels, and for real property taxes in excess of $106,000 annually.
202947_11_ITEM1_P22_S6	The Company bears all of the operating costs with respect to the Facility, including a portion of the real property taxes and insurance.
202947_11_ITEM1_P22_S7	In addition, Global has an option to purchase the Facility at any time during the term of the lease (other than the last year thereof) on the terms and conditions set forth in a separate option agreement.
202947_11_ITEM1_P22_S8	Under a companion agreement, Global has agreed to pay 50% of the cost of all improvements to the Pier but not more than $1,000,000; to date Global has paid $966,000.
202947_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	The operation of a petroleum storage facility carries with it the risk of environmental contamination.
202947_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	Environmental incident (2010): On August 30, 2010, during a regular facility inspection of the Terminal, a release of petroleum-contaminated water was discovered from the tank bottom of one of the Company s 150,000 barrel tanks (Tank 153).
202947_11_ITEM1_P24_S1	The Company notified the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM), the Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Coast Guard.
202947_11_ITEM1_P24_S2	It also notified its insurance carriers of the release and the damage to the tank.
202947_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	The tank was emptied of product and the cleaning of the tank bottom was completed in September 2010.
202947_11_ITEM1_P25_S1	The petroleum-contaminated water released from the tank was contained on the secondary containment liner under the tank bottom, preventing contamination of the groundwater.
202947_11_ITEM1_P25_S2	The Company engaged an outside engineering firm to inspect the tank bottom to determine the cause and location of the release, as well as the extent of the required repairs.
202947_11_ITEM1_P25_S3	The findings of the inspection indicated that aggressive corrosion from inside the tank occurred, causing two holes in the immediate vicinity of the observed release, as well as several other holes or potential holes in other areas of the tank bottom.
202947_11_ITEM1_P25_S4	The report indicates that the corrosion was caused by microbial contamination, which was affirmed by a corrosion specialist.
202947_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	The total cost of the cleanup, inspection and repair of the tank was $550,000.
202947_11_ITEM1_P26_S1	Tank 153 was placed back in service in February 2011.
202947_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	The testing of certain of the Company s other tanks revealed the presence of corrosive microbial contaminants in Tanks 151 and 32.
202947_11_ITEM1_P27_S1	Both tanks were treated with a biocide and continue to be monitored and treated as necessary.
202947_11_ITEM1_P27_S2	Since Tank 32 had been inspected in June 2010, the Company believes that the contaminants have not affected the integrity of this tank bottom.
202947_11_ITEM1_P27_S3	However, since Tank 151 had not been inspected since construction in 2006, the Company took this tank out of service in the first quarter of 2011 for a complete inspection of the tank bottom.
202947_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	At this time, management does not know which costs, if any, will be recovered under its insurance policies; however, the Company has put its insurance carrier on notice under the property policy with its insurance carrier to recover the repair costs.
202947_11_ITEM1_P28_S1	The deductibles on the Company s insurance policies are $50,000 for environmental and $75,000 for property.
202947_11_ITEM1_P28_S2	In addition, the Company is reviewing all of the facts and circumstances to determine if it has a claim against third parties for costs of cleanup, inspection and repair.
202947_11_ITEM1_P28_S3	The Company cannot determine with any certainty what amount may be recovered from a third party and, accordingly, has not recorded any receivable at December 31, 2010.
202947_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	Environmental incident (2002): In 2002, during testing of monitoring wells at the Terminal, the Company s consulting engineer discovered free floating phase product in a groundwater monitoring well located on that portion of the Terminal purchased in 2000.
202947_11_ITEM1_P29_S1	Laboratory analysis indicated that the product was gasoline, which is not a product the Company ever stored at the Terminal.
202947_11_ITEM1_P29_S2	The Company commenced an environmental investigation and analysis, the results of which indicate that the gasoline did not come from the Terminal.
202947_11_ITEM1_P29_S3	RIDEM subsequently identified Power Test Realty Partnership (Power Test), the owner of an adjacent parcel, as a potentially responsible party for the contamination.
202947_11_ITEM1_P29_S4	Getty Properties Corp. is the general partner of Power Test.
202947_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	Power Test challenged that determination and, after an administrative hearing, on October 20, 2008, a RIDEM Hearing Officer determined that Power Test is responsible for the discharge of the petroleum product under the Rhode Island Oil Pollution Control Act, R.I.G.L. Section 46-12.5.1-3 and Rule 6(a) and 12(b) of the Oil Pollution Control Regulations.
202947_11_ITEM1_P30_S1	The RIDEM Decision and Order requires Power Test to remediate the contamination as directed by RIDEM and remanded the proposed penalty to RIDEM for recalculation.
202947_11_ITEM1_P30_S2	In November 2008, Power Test appealed the decision to the Rhode Island Superior Court.
202947_11_ITEM1_P30_S3	In addition, in November 2008, Power Test sought, and received, a stay of the Decision and Order of the Hearing Officer pending a clarification by RIDEM of the amount of the proposed penalty.
202947_11_ITEM1_P30_S4	On October 2, 2009, RIDEM issued a recalculated administrative penalty, and, subsequently, the RIDEM Hearing Officer issued a recommended amended decision, which was affirmed as a final decision by the RIDEM Director on December 23, 2009.
202947_11_ITEM1_P30_S5	On January 20, 2010, Power Test appealed that decision to Superior Court.
202947_11_ITEM1_P30_S6	There can be no assurance that the Superior Court will affirm the final RIDEM decision.
202947_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	In April 2009, the Company sued Power Test and Getty Properties Corp. in the Rhode Island Superior Court seeking remediation of the site or, in the alternative, the cost of the remediation.
202947_11_ITEM1_P31_S1	On May 1, 2009, Power Test and Getty Properties Corp. removed the action to the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island.
202947_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	On May 22, 2009, Power Test and Getty Properties Corp. answered the Complaint and filed a Counterclaim against Dunellen, LLC and Capital Terminal Company alleging that Dunellen, LLC and Capital Terminal Company are responsible for the contamination.
202947_11_ITEM1_P32_S1	Getty Properties Corp. and Power Test have joined Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc., the tenant under a long-term lease with Getty Properties Corp. of the adjacent property, as a defendant.
202947_11_ITEM1_P32_S2	The Company has amended its Complaint to add Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. as a defendant.
202947_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	In February 2011, the Company was notified by the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island that the case was being transferred to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire due to a backlog of cases in Rhode Island.
202947_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	The parties are now engaged in discovery.
202947_11_ITEM1_P34_S1	There can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in this litigation.
202947_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	Since January 2003, the Company has not incurred significant costs in connection with this matter, other than ongoing litigation costs, and is unable to determine the costs it might incur to remedy the situation, as well as any costs to investigate, defend and seek reimbursement from the responsible party with respect to this contamination.
202947_11_ITEM1_P35_S1	This situation does not affect current operations at the Facility but may affect the Company s ability to sell the Facility should it determine to do so.
202947_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	In 1994, a leak was discovered in a 25,000 barrel storage tank at the Terminal which allowed the escape of a small amount of fuel oil.
202947_11_ITEM1_P36_S1	All required notices were made to RIDEM.
202947_11_ITEM1_P36_S2	In 2000, the tank was demolished and testing of the groundwater indicated that there was no large pooling of contaminants.
202947_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	In 2001, RIDEM approved a plan pursuant to which the Company installed a passive system consisting of three wells and commenced monitoring the wells.
202947_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	In 2003, RIDEM decided that the passive monitoring system previously approved was not sufficient and required the Company to design an active remediation system for the removal of product from the contaminated site.
202947_11_ITEM1_P38_S1	The Company and its consulting engineers began the pre-design testing of the site in the fourth quarter of 2004.
202947_11_ITEM1_P38_S2	The consulting engineers estimated a total cost of $200,000 to design, install and operate the system, which amount was accrued in 2004.
202947_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	RIDEM has not taken any action on the Company s proposed plan.
202947_11_ITEM1_P40_S0	As designed, the system will pump out the contaminants which will be disposed of in compliance with applicable regulations.
202947_11_ITEM1_P40_S1	After a period of time, the groundwater will be tested to determine if sufficient contaminants have been removed.
202947_11_ITEM1_P40_S2	While the Company and its consulting engineers believe that the proposed active remediation system will correct the situation, it is possible that RIDEM could require the Company to expand remediation efforts, which could result in the Company incurring additional costs.
202947_11_ITEM1_P41_S0	The Company manages its exposure to contamination, remediation or similar costs associated with the Facility through adherence to established procedures for operations and equipment maintenance.
202947_11_ITEM1_P42_S0	The Company maintains what management believes to be adequate levels of insurance, including environmental insurance.
202947_11_ITEM1_P43_S0	The Company notified its insurance company of the gasoline contamination associated with the incident in 2002.
202947_11_ITEM1_P43_S1	The insurance company advised the Company that coverage is only provided under policies in place at the time the contamination occurs.
202947_11_ITEM1_P44_S0	The Facility competes with several other similar facilities located on and adjacent to the Providence Harbor.
202947_11_ITEM1_P45_S0	The Terminal has approximately 42% of the total distillate storage capacity in the Providence area.
202947_11_ITEM1_P46_S0	Global competes with other terminal operators on the basis of price, availability, and a willingness to advance credit to local wholesalers.
202947_11_ITEM1_P46_S1	The amount of petroleum throughput at the Terminal is a function of Global s ability to compete effectively in the marketplace.
202947_11_ITEM1_P47_S0	The Terminal employs seven people on a full-time basis and one person on a part-time basis.
202947_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Company owns approximately 18.5 acres and a historic building in and adjacent to the Capital Center District in Providence, Rhode Island.
202947_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	All of the property and a portion of the building are leased either under long-term leases or short-term leases as more particularly described in Item 1, Leasing Segment.
202947_11_ITEM2_P1_S0	The Company also owns or controls 24 locations on which billboards have been constructed.
202947_11_ITEM2_P1_S1	Of these, 22 are owned by the Company under permanent easements from a related company, the Railroad, and two are leased from unrelated third parties with terms remaining terms of five years or less.
202947_11_ITEM2_P2_S0	The Company owns an approximate 10-acre site in East Providence, Rhode Island on which there are located nine petroleum storage tanks and related distribution racks together with a 3,000 square foot single-story office building in which the Company s headquarters and other support operations are located.
202947_11_ITEM2_P2_S1	In 2006, the Company completed the development of the land currently owned by the Company at the Terminal.
202947_11_ITEM2_P2_S2	In addition, the Company is the owner of the Pier located in East Providence, Rhode Island.
202947_11_ITEM2_P2_S3	The Pier, which has a deep water draft capacity of -40 feet MLW, can accommodate ships up to eight hundred feet in length.
202947_11_ITEM2_P2_S4	The Company has a permanent right to use the pipelines connecting the Pier to the Terminal.
202947_11_ITEM5_P0_S0	The Company s Class A Common Stock is traded on the OTCQX, symbol CPTP.
202947_11_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table shows the high and low trading prices for the Company s Class A Common Stock during the quarterly periods indicated as obtained from the OTCQX, together with cash dividends paid per share during such periods.
202947_11_ITEM5_P1_S0	Information with respect to the high and low trading prices for the Class B Common Stock is not available because the stock is not listed on any exchange, is not quoted by any quotation service, and there is no known market for such Class B Common Stock.
202947_11_ITEM5_P2_S0	At March 1, 2011, there were 634 holders of record of the Company s Class A Common Stock and 552 holders of record of the Company s Class B Common Stock.
202947_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	The Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) has issued guidance for the disclosure of critical accounting policies.
202947_11_ITEM7_P0_S1	The SEC defines such policies as those that require application of management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.
202947_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	The Company s significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
202947_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	Not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates.
202947_11_ITEM7_P1_S2	Management believes that the Company s revenue recognition policy for long-term leases with scheduled rent increases (leasing segment) meets the SEC definition of critical.
202947_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	Certain of the Company s long-term land leases have original terms of 30 to 149 years and contain scheduled rent increases where the future dollar increases are known at the time of the commencement of the lease or at a subsequent date.
202947_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	The first such lease commenced in 1988, had an original term of 99 years and provides for fixed percentage increases at specified intervals (as well as reappraisal increases).
202947_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	In accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles in accounting for leases, rental income related to the fixed percentage increases that are presently known should be recognized on a straight-line basis.
202947_11_ITEM7_P3_S2	To calculate the annual straight-line amount, the 99 known annual rental amounts are totaled and this total is divided by 99.
202947_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	In 2009, a scheduled appraisal occurred, resulting in a rental increase.
202947_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	The Company recalculated the future annual straight-line amount using the remaining years under the lease.
202947_11_ITEM7_P4_S2	The turnaround date discussed below did not change.
202947_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	For this lease, the calculated annual straight-line amount for 1988 was eight times (multiple) the amount paid by the tenant under the terms of the lease (the contractual amount ).
202947_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	In subsequent years, as the tenant pays higher rents, the multiple gradually decreases until the 57 th year of the lease, at which time the contractual amount paid by the tenant will exceed the calculated straight-line amount.
202947_11_ITEM7_P5_S2	If the Company were to report annual revenue for this lease using the straight-line amount, it would record a significant receivable for each of the first 56 years, which receivable would grow to approximately $34,000,000.
202947_11_ITEM7_P5_S3	Management does not believe that the Company should record a receivable that would not begin to be collected until the 56 th year (the turnaround date ) since management could not be assured of collection.
202947_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	In 1988, management met with the SEC accounting staff to discuss its concerns in applying United States generally accepted accounting principles as they related to a lease of this length which results in the recording of such a significant receivable that would remain on the Company s balance sheet and continue to grow on an annual basis with a turnaround date so far in the future.
202947_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	The Company presented the SEC accounting staff with an application of the accounting policy whereby management would evaluate the collectibility of the receivable on an annual basis and report as leasing revenue only that portion of the receivable that management could presently conclude would be collectible.
202947_11_ITEM7_P6_S2	The SEC accounting staff did not object to this application by the Company.
202947_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	Through December 31, 2010, the receivable on this lease has grown to $19,290,000 (cumulative excess of straight-line over contractual rentals) and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround date is still 35 years away.
202947_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	In 2004, a second such lease commenced with an original term of 149 years and provides for fixed minimum percentage increases at specified intervals (as well as reappraisal increases).
202947_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	For this lease, the contractual amount paid by the tenant will not exceed the calculated straight-line amount until the 94 th year of the lease.
202947_11_ITEM7_P8_S2	Through December 31, 2010, the receivable on this lease is $16,019,000 (cumulative excess of straight-line over contractual rentals) and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround date is 87 years away.
202947_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	In 2006, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Agreement of its lease with Lamar Outdoor Advertising LLC ( Lamar ) with a current remaining term of 25 years which provides for fixed percentage increases annually.
202947_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	For this lease, the contractual amount paid by Lamar will not exceed the calculated straight-line amount until the 16 th year of the lease.
202947_11_ITEM7_P9_S2	Through December 31, 2010, the receivable on this lease is $1,021,000 (cumulative excess of straight-line over contractual rentals) and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround date is 11 years away.
202947_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	Accordingly, the Company has not reported any portion of these amounts as leasing revenue in its consolidated financial statements and does not anticipate that it can reach such a conclusion until the turnaround dates are closer.
202947_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	Although the Company s other long-term land leases provide for scheduled rent increases, the provisions of the leases are such that certain future dollar amounts could not be calculated either at the time of the commencement of the lease or now, as such amounts are based on factors that are not presently known, i.e., future cost-of -living adjustments or future appraised values.
202947_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	Through December 31, 2010, the receivable on these leases is $8,820,000 and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround dates are approximately 50 years away.
202947_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	The Company continues to recognize accrued leasing revenue from two leases which were recorded in prior years.
202947_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	The Company operates in two segments: leasing and petroleum storage.
202947_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	The leasing segment consists of the long-term leasing of certain of its real estate interests in downtown Providence, Rhode Island (upon the commencement of which the tenants have been required to construct buildings thereon, with the exception of a parking garage), the leasing of a portion of the Steeple Street Building acquired in 2007 under short-term leasing arrangements and the leasing of locations along interstate and primary highways in Rhode Island and Massachusetts to Lamar which has constructed outdoor advertising boards thereon.
202947_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	The Company anticipates that the future development of its remaining properties in and adjacent to the Capital Center area will consist primarily of long-term ground leases.
202947_11_ITEM7_P14_S2	Pending this development, the Company leases these parcels for public parking under short-term leasing arrangements to Metropark.
202947_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	The petroleum storage segment consists of operating the Facility in East Providence, Rhode Island, for Global Companies, LLC ( Global ).
202947_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	The principal difference between the two segments relates to the nature of the operations.
202947_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	In the leasing segment, the tenants under the long-term land leases incur substantially all of the development and operating costs of the assets constructed on the Company s land, including the payment of real property taxes on both the land and any improvements constructed thereon; whereas the Company is responsible for the operating and maintenance expenditures, including a portion of the real property taxes, as well as certain capital improvements at the Facility.
202947_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	Leasing revenues increased due to the termination of the rent relief granted Lamar and Metropark in 2009 (which rents were restored to their scheduled level on July 1, 2010) and scheduled increases in rentals under long-term land leases.
202947_11_ITEM7_P18_S1	Leasing expense increased due to higher legal fees in connection with two leases, an increase in property taxes and depreciation on the Steeple Street Building.
202947_11_ITEM7_P18_S2	These increases were offset in part by the reversal of an allowance for a doubtful account of $40,000.
202947_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	Petroleum storage facility revenues increased due to the May 1, 2010 annual cost-of-living adjustment of $82,000 under the lease for the petroleum storage facility.
202947_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	Petroleum storage facility expense increased due to costs of $550,000 recorded in connection with the leak in Tank 153 in August 2010.
202947_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	In April 2010 , the Company borrowed $6,000,000 from a bank.
202947_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	The loan bears interest at an annual rate of 6 percent and has a term of ten years with repayments on a twenty-year amortization schedule (monthly principal payments of $25,000 plus interest).
202947_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2010 does not bear the customary relationship between income tax expense and pretax accounting income.
202947_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	The Company determined that the expenditures in connection with the historic restoration of the Steeple Street Building qualified for federal historic income tax credits in 2010 totaling approximately $588,000 and has incorporated the credit in determining the effective tax rate for 2010.
202947_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	Historically, the Company has had adequate liquidity to fund its operations.
202947_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	In April 2010, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a special dividend of $5,478,000 ($.83 per common share) on the Class A and Class B common stock to shareholders of record on May 12, 2010 payable on May 26, 2010.
202947_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	The dividend represented the payout to the shareholders of the Company s earnings and profits as calculated for federal income tax purposes at December 31, 2009.
202947_11_ITEM7_P23_S2	The Company has expressed its intention in the future to convert to a pass-through entity for income tax purposes.
202947_11_ITEM7_P23_S3	In order to effectuate such a conversion, the Company will be required to pay out its accumulated earnings and profits.
202947_11_ITEM7_P23_S4	The Board of Directors determined that it would be in the best interest of the shareholders to make the distribution of the earnings and profits while the tax laws were still favorable, since management at that time expected that the federal income tax rate on dividends would rise substantially on January 1, 2011.
202947_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	In order to fund the special dividend, the Company borrowed $6,000,000 from a bank.
202947_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	The loan bears interest at an annual rate of 6 percent and has a term of ten years with repayments on a twenty-year amortization schedule (monthly principal payments of $25,000 plus interest).
202947_11_ITEM7_P24_S2	The loan matures April 26, 2020, contains the customary covenants, terms and conditions, and permits prepayment, in whole or in part, at any time without penalty if the prepayment is made from internally generated funds.
202947_11_ITEM7_P24_S3	As collateral for the loan, the Company granted the bank a mortgage on Parcels 3S and 5 in the Capital Center.
202947_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	At December 31, 2010, the Company had cash of $2,395,000.
202947_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	The Company maintains all of its cash in a non-interest bearing checking account which is fully insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
202947_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	In July 2009, the Company received notice from the holder of the leasehold mortgage on Parcel 8 that the Parcel 8 tenant was in default.
202947_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	A foreclosure sale was held in September 2009, and the building was sold to the leasehold mortgagee.
202947_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	Under the terms of the Parcel 8 long-term land lease, upon the foreclosure of the leasehold mortgage, the Company is required to enter into a new long-term lease with the leasehold mortgagee or its assignee on substantially the same terms and conditions as the existing lease for Parcel 8.
202947_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	No new lease has been entered into to date.
202947_11_ITEM7_P27_S2	In such circumstances, the new tenant is required to cure any prior monetary defaults.
202947_11_ITEM7_P27_S3	The rent has continued to be paid in a timely fashion, and the Company has no reason to believe that the leasehold mortgagee will not continue to pay the rent and property taxes to the City of Providence in a timely fashion.
202947_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	Under the terms of the Company s long-term land leases, appraisals of the premises are periodically required at various stated intervals to provide the basis for recalculating the annual rent.
202947_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	The appraisal process for Parcel 8 commenced in November 2009 and the final appraisal was completed in September 2010, resulting in an annual increase of $47,000 retroactive to February 1, 2010.
202947_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	Under the lease which commenced in 2005, the tenant is entitled to a credit for future rents equal to a portion of the real property taxes paid by the tenant through April 2007.
202947_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	In connection with Phase I of the tenant s project, commencing July 1, 2010, the annual rent increased from $48,000 to $300,000.
202947_11_ITEM7_P29_S2	As a result of the rent credit, the tenant will not be required to make cash payments for rent until May 2012.
202947_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	Commencing July 1, 2010, the Company is reclassifying each month $25,000 of deferred leasing revenues to leasing revenues.
202947_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	At December 31, 2010, the remaining credit is $370,000.
202947_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	Under the Company s long-term land lease on Parcel 9, on April 1, 2011, the scheduled contractual rent will increase $260,000 annually.
202947_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	Under the Company s long-term land lease on Parcel 2, on May 1, 2011, the scheduled contractual rent will increase $384,000 annually.
202947_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	The current economic conditions have had limited impact on the Company s results of operations to date.
202947_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	In 2009, the Company granted rent concessions to two tenants of its leasing segment, which concessions terminated July 1, 2010, for a total increase of $93,000 annually.
202947_11_ITEM7_P32_S2	As none of the Company s leases require the tenant to provide financial information, the Company has no information concerning the impact of current economic conditions on its major tenants and, therefore, cannot predict whether any other tenants will request rent relief or concessions.
202947_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	In June 2009, the Company commenced the construction of the historic restoration and utility infrastructure of the Steeple Street Building, which was completed in December 2010 at a total cost of $3,178,000 plus tenant improvements of $191,000.
202947_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	The Company has determined that certain expenditures qualify for federal historic tax credits in 2010 totaling $588,000.
202947_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	At December 31, 2010, the Company has two tenants in a portion of the Steeple Street Building (including the new tenant who assumed the lease) under short-term leases (five years or less) at a current annual rental of $88,000.
202947_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	The Company is currently marketing the remaining portions of the building for lease.
202947_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	Under the Company s lease with Global, the annual cost-of-living adjustment was $82,000 effective May 1, 2010.
202947_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	On August 30, 2010, during a regular facility inspection of the Terminal, a release of petroleum-contaminated water was discovered from the tank bottom of one of the Company s 150,000 barrel tanks (Tank 153).
202947_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	The Company notified the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM), the Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Coast Guard.
202947_11_ITEM7_P36_S2	It also notified its insurance carriers of the release and the damage to the tank.
202947_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	The tank was emptied of product and the cleaning of the tank bottom was completed in September.
202947_11_ITEM7_P37_S1	The petroleum-contaminated water released from the tank was contained on the secondary containment liner under the tank bottom, preventing contamination of the groundwater.
202947_11_ITEM7_P37_S2	The Company engaged an outside engineering firm to inspect the tank bottom to determine the cause and location of the release, as well as the extent of the required repairs.
202947_11_ITEM7_P37_S3	The findings of the inspection indicated that aggressive corrosion from inside the tank occurred, causing two holes in the immediate vicinity of the observed release, as well as several other holes or potential holes in other areas of the tank bottom.
202947_11_ITEM7_P37_S4	The report indicates that the corrosion was caused by microbial contamination, which was affirmed by a corrosion specialist.
202947_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	The total cost of the cleanup, inspection and repair of the tank was $550,000 (of which $273,000 has been paid through December 31, 2010).
202947_11_ITEM7_P38_S1	The tank was placed back in service in February 2011.
202947_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	The testing of certain of the Company s other tanks revealed the presence of corrosive microbial contaminants in Tanks 151 and 32.
202947_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	Both tanks were treated with a biocide and continue to be monitored and treated as necessary.
202947_11_ITEM7_P39_S2	Since Tank 32 had been inspected in June 2010, the Company believes that the contaminants have not affected the integrity of this tank bottom.
202947_11_ITEM7_P39_S3	However, since Tank 151 had not been inspected since construction in 2006, the Company took this tank out of service in February 2011 for approximately one month for a complete inspection of the tank bottom.
202947_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	At this time, management does not know which costs, if any, will be recovered under its insurance policies; however, the Company has put its insurance carrier on notice under the property policy with its insurance carrier to recover the repair costs.
202947_11_ITEM7_P40_S1	The deductibles on the Company s insurance policies are $50,000 for environmental and $75,000 for property.
202947_11_ITEM7_P40_S2	In addition, the Company is reviewing all of the facts and circumstances to determine if it has a claim against third parties for costs of cleanup, inspection and repair.
202947_11_ITEM7_P40_S3	The Company cannot determine with any certainty what amount may be recovered from a third party and, accordingly, has not recorded any receivable at December 31, 2010.
202947_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	In January 2011, the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $198,000 ($.03 per common share) which was paid in February 2011.
202947_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	The declaration of future dividends and the amount thereof will depend on the Company s future earnings, financial factors and other events.
202947_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	The Company expects that cash generated from current operations will continue to be sufficient to meet operating expenses, debt service, ordinary capital expenditures and the current level of quarterly dividends.
202947_11_ITEM7_P42_S1	In the event temporary liquidity is required, the Company believes that a line of credit or other arrangements could be obtained by pledging some or all of its unencumbered assets as collateral.
202947_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	At December 31, 2010, the Company has no noncancellable contract obligations other than two operating leases for billboard locations for which the rent expense is not material in amount.
202947_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Capital Properties, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income and retained earnings, and cash flows for the years then ended.
202947_11_ITEM8_P0_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
202947_11_ITEM8_P0_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
202947_11_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
202947_11_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
202947_11_ITEM8_P1_S2	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
202947_11_ITEM8_P1_S3	An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
202947_11_ITEM8_P1_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
202947_11_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
202947_11_ITEM8_P2_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
202947_11_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Capital Properties, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
202947_11_ITEM8_P4_S0	See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.
202947_11_ITEM8_P5_S0	See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.
202947_11_ITEM8_P6_S0	See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.
202947_11_ITEM8_P7_S0	Capital Properties, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Tri-State Displays, Inc., Capital Terminal Company and Dunellen, LLC (collectively referred to as the Company ) operate in two segments: (1) Leasing and (2) Petroleum Storage.
202947_11_ITEM8_P8_S0	The leasing segment consists of the long-term leasing of certain of its real estate interests in downtown Providence, Rhode Island (upon the commencement of which the tenants are required to construct buildings thereon, with the exception of a parking garage), the leasing of a portion of its building ( Steeple Street Building ) under short-term leasing arrangements and the leasing of locations along interstate and primary highways in Rhode Island and Massachusetts to Lamar Outdoor Advertising, LLC ( Lamar ) which has constructed outdoor advertising boards thereon.
202947_11_ITEM8_P8_S1	The Company anticipates that the future development of its remaining properties in and adjacent to the Capital Center area will consist primarily of long-term ground leases.
202947_11_ITEM8_P8_S2	Pending this development, the Company leases these parcels for public parking under short-term leasing arrangements to Metropark, Ltd. ( Metropark ).
202947_11_ITEM8_P9_S0	The petroleum storage segment consists of operating the petroleum storage terminal (the Terminal ) and the Wilkesbarre Pier (the Pier ), collectively referred to as the Facility, located in East Providence, Rhode Island, for Global Companies, LLC ( Global ) which stores and distributes petroleum distillates.
202947_11_ITEM8_P10_S0	The principal difference between the two segments relates to the nature of the operations.
202947_11_ITEM8_P11_S0	In the leasing segment, the tenants under long-term land leases incur substantially all of the development and operating costs of the assets constructed on the Company s land, including the payment of real property taxes on both the land and any improvements constructed thereon; whereas the Company is responsible for the operating and maintenance expenditures, including a portion of the real property taxes, as well as certain capital improvements at the Facility.
202947_11_ITEM8_P12_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts and transactions of the Company and its subsidiaries.
202947_11_ITEM8_P12_S1	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
202947_11_ITEM8_P13_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.
202947_11_ITEM8_P13_S1	Estimates also affect the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.
202947_11_ITEM8_P13_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
202947_11_ITEM8_P14_S0	The Company believes that the fair values of its financial instruments, including receivables, payables and the note payable approximate their respective book values at December 31, 2010 and 2009.
202947_11_ITEM8_P14_S1	The fair value of the note payable was determined using borrowing rates currently available to the Company for loans with similar terms and maturities.
202947_11_ITEM8_P15_S0	Properties and equipment are stated at cost.
202947_11_ITEM8_P15_S1	Acquisitions and additions are capitalized while routine maintenance and repairs, which do not improve the asset or extend its life, are charged to expense when incurred.
202947_11_ITEM8_P15_S2	Depreciation is being provided by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.
202947_11_ITEM8_P16_S0	The Company follows United States generally accepted accounting principles when accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, which requires that properties and equipment held and used by the Company be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value of the asset may not be recoverable.
202947_11_ITEM8_P16_S1	An impairment loss will be recognized if the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and before interest) from the use of the asset is less than the net book value of the asset.
202947_11_ITEM8_P16_S2	Generally, the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the estimated fair value of the asset.
202947_11_ITEM8_P17_S0	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
202947_11_ITEM8_P17_S1	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had no cash equivalents.
202947_11_ITEM8_P17_S2	The Company maintains all of its cash in non-interest bearing checking accounts in one bank which are fully insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
202947_11_ITEM8_P18_S0	The Company accrues a liability when an environmental remediation is probable and the costs are estimable.
202947_11_ITEM8_P18_S1	The Company charges to expense those costs that do not extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of the property owned by the Company.
202947_11_ITEM8_P18_S2	The Company does not record a receivable for recoveries from third parties for environmental matters until it has determined that the amount of the collection is assured.
202947_11_ITEM8_P19_S0	Leasing The Company s properties leased to others are under operating leases.
202947_11_ITEM8_P19_S1	The Company reports leasing revenue when earned under the operating method.
202947_11_ITEM8_P20_S0	Certain of the Company s long-term land leases, including the outdoor advertising locations, provide for presently known scheduled rent increases over the remaining terms (23 to 144 years).
202947_11_ITEM8_P20_S1	The Company follows United States generally accepted accounting principles in accounting for leases by recognizing leasing revenue on the straight-line basis over the terms of the leases; however, the Company does not report as revenue that portion of such straight-line rentals which management is unable to conclude is realizable (collectible) due to the length of the lease terms and other related uncertainties.
202947_11_ITEM8_P21_S0	Petroleum storage facility The Company reports revenue from the operations of the Facility when earned and reports as revenue the tenant s portion of the real property taxes as required by the lease.
202947_11_ITEM8_P22_S0	Contingent The Company reports contingent revenue in the period in which the factors occur on which the contingent payments are predicated.
202947_11_ITEM8_P23_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries file consolidated income tax returns.
202947_11_ITEM8_P24_S0	The Company provides for income taxes based on income reported for financial reporting purposes.
202947_11_ITEM8_P24_S1	The provision for income taxes differs from the amounts currently payable because of temporary differences associated with the recognition of certain income and expense items for financial reporting and tax reporting purposes.
202947_11_ITEM8_P25_S0	The Company follows United States generally accepted accounting principles in accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.
202947_11_ITEM8_P25_S1	Based on its evaluation, the Company has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the consolidated financial statements.
202947_11_ITEM8_P26_S0	The Company recognizes legal fees as incurred.
202947_11_ITEM8_P27_S0	The Company reviews new accounting standards as issued.
202947_11_ITEM8_P27_S1	Although some of these accounting standards may be applicable to the Company, the Company has not identified any standards that it believes merit further discussion.
202947_11_ITEM8_P27_S2	The Company expects that none of the new standards will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
202947_11_ITEM8_P28_S0	Properties and equipment consist of the following:
202947_11_ITEM8_P29_S0	In April 2010 , the Company borrowed $6,000,000 from a bank.
202947_11_ITEM8_P29_S1	The loan bears interest an annual rate of 6 percent and has a term of ten years with repayments on a twenty-year amortization schedule (monthly principal payments of $25,000 plus interest).
202947_11_ITEM8_P29_S2	The loan matures April 26, 2020, contains the customary covenants, terms and conditions, and permits prepayment, in whole or in part, at any time without penalty if the prepayment is made from internally generated funds.
202947_11_ITEM8_P29_S3	As collateral for the loan, the Company granted the bank a mortgage on Parcels 3S and 5 in the Capital Center.
202947_11_ITEM8_P30_S0	In May 2010, the proceeds from the loan were used principally to fund a special dividend of $5,478,000 to shareholders, which represented the Company s earnings and profits as calculated for federal income tax purposes at December 31, 2009.
202947_11_ITEM8_P31_S0	The following is a schedule of principal payments for the remaining term of the note payable:
202947_11_ITEM8_P32_S0	In connection with the borrowing, the Company incurred financing fees totaling $55,000, which are included in prepaid and other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2010.
202947_11_ITEM8_P32_S1	These fees are being amortized on the straight-method over the 10-year term of the note, which approximates the effective interest rate method.
202947_11_ITEM8_P33_S0	expense on the accompanying consolidated statement of income and retained earnings for the year ended December 31, 2010.
202947_11_ITEM8_P34_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the Company had entered into six long-term land leases for six separate parcels upon which the improvements have been completed ( developed parcels ).
202947_11_ITEM8_P34_S1	In addition, in 2005 a long-term land lease commenced on an undeveloped parcel on which two residential buildings were planned.
202947_11_ITEM8_P34_S2	One building was completed in September 2009.
202947_11_ITEM8_P34_S3	The other building has not progressed beyond the early stages of site preparation and the timing of its construction and completion is uncertain.
202947_11_ITEM8_P35_S0	Under two of the long-term land leases, the Company receives contingent rentals (based upon a fixed percentage of gross revenue received by the tenants) which totaled $55,000 and $52,000 for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
202947_11_ITEM8_P36_S0	Under the seven land leases, the tenants are required to negotiate any tax stabilization treaty or other arrangements, appeal any changes in real property assessments, and pay real property taxes assessed on land and improvements under these arrangements.
202947_11_ITEM8_P36_S1	Accordingly, real property taxes payable by the tenants are excluded from leasing revenues and leasing expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of income and retained earnings.
202947_11_ITEM8_P36_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the real property taxes attributable to the Company s land under these seven leases are $1,109,000 and $1,199,000, respectively.
202947_11_ITEM8_P37_S0	Under the lease which commenced in 2005, the tenant is entitled to a credit for future rents equal to a portion of the real property taxes paid by the tenant through April 2007.
202947_11_ITEM8_P37_S1	In connection with Phase I of the tenant s project, commencing July 1, 2010, the annual rent increased from $48,000 to $300,000.
202947_11_ITEM8_P37_S2	As a result of the rent credit, the tenant will not be required to make cash payments for rent until May 2012.
202947_11_ITEM8_P38_S0	Commencing July 1, 2010, the Company is reclassifying each month $25,000 of deferred leasing revenues to leasing revenues.
202947_11_ITEM8_P38_S1	At December 31, 2010, the remaining credit is $370,000.
202947_11_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Company also leases various parcels of land for outdoor advertising purposes to Lamar under a lease having a remaining term of 23 years.
202947_11_ITEM8_P39_S1	Effective June 1, 2006, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Agreement with Lamar which among other things provides the following: (1) the base rent will increase annually in fixed increases of 2.75% for each leased billboard location commencing June 1, 2006 and on each June 1 thereafter; and (2) in addition to base rent, for each 12-month period commencing each June 1, Lamar must pay to the Company the difference between 30% of the gross revenues from each standard billboard and 20% of the gross revenues from each electronic billboard for such 12-month period reduced by the sum of (a) commissions paid to third parties and (b) the base monthly rent for each leased billboard display for such 12-month period ( contingent revenue ).
202947_11_ITEM8_P39_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, contingent revenues totaled $55,000 and $61,000, respectively.
202947_11_ITEM8_P39_S3	In all other respects, the lease remains substantially unchanged.
202947_11_ITEM8_P40_S0	At December 31, 2010, there are 24 locations under lease with 46 billboard faces.
202947_11_ITEM8_P40_S1	Of these locations, 22 are controlled through permanent easements and two are leased from third parties under operating leases with remaining terms of five years or less.
202947_11_ITEM8_P41_S0	Minimum future contractual rental payments to be received from noncancellable long-term leases as of December 31, 2010 are:
202947_11_ITEM8_P42_S0	the leases) and the portion of the excess of straight-line over contractual rentals which management has concluded is realizable when payable over the terms of the leases are as follows:
202947_11_ITEM8_P43_S0	In the event of tenant default, the Company has the right to reclaim its leased land together with any improvements thereon, subject to the right of any leasehold mortgagee to enter into a new lease with the Company with the same terms and conditions as the lease in default.
202947_11_ITEM8_P44_S0	The Company leases the undeveloped parcels of land in or adjacent to the Capital Center area for public parking purposes to Metropark, Ltd. under short-term cancellable leases.
202947_11_ITEM8_P45_S0	A former tenant of the Steeple Street Building filed for receivership in November 2009.
202947_11_ITEM8_P45_S1	At December 31, 2009, the former tenant owed the Company $40,000 and the Company recorded an allowance for a doubtful account of $40,000.
202947_11_ITEM8_P45_S2	In June 2010, the former tenant sold its operations to a new tenant who assumed the lease and paid the Company in full; the Company reversed the allowance for doubtful accounts for the full amount.
202947_11_ITEM8_P46_S0	At December 31, 2010, the Company has two tenants in a portion of the Steeple Street Building (including the new tenant who assumed the lease) under short-term leases of five years or less at a current annual rental of $88,000.
202947_11_ITEM8_P46_S1	The Company is presently marketing the remaining portions of the building for lease.
202947_11_ITEM8_P47_S0	The Company and Global are parties to a lease agreement whereby the Company operates the entire Facility for Global.
202947_11_ITEM8_P48_S0	The Company is responsible for labor, insurance, property taxes and other operating expenses, as well as certain capital improvements.
202947_11_ITEM8_P49_S0	The Company will receive an additional $.10 per barrel for every barrel in excess of 4,000,000 barrels of throughput in any lease year (contingent revenue).
202947_11_ITEM8_P50_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company earned contingent revenue of $2,000; however, no contingent revenue was earned in 2010.
202947_11_ITEM8_P51_S0	The monthly rent at January 1, 2009 was $296,000; due to a decrease in the cost-of-living index, there was no rent adjustment in May 2009.
202947_11_ITEM8_P51_S1	In May 2010, the monthly rent increased to $303,000 as a result of the annual cost-of-living adjustment.
202947_11_ITEM8_P52_S0	Effective May 2003, Global has an option to purchase the Facility at any time during the term of the lease (other than the last year thereof) on the terms and conditions set forth in a separate option agreement.
202947_11_ITEM8_P52_S1	Under a companion agreement, Global agreed to make certain improvements at the Pier which totaled $77,000 in 2010.
202947_11_ITEM8_P52_S2	No improvements were made in 2009.
202947_11_ITEM8_P53_S0	On August 30, 2010, during a regular facility inspection of the Terminal, a release of petroleum-contaminated water was discovered from the tank bottom of one of the Company s 150,000 barrel tanks (Tank 153).
202947_11_ITEM8_P53_S1	The Company notified the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM), the Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Coast Guard.
202947_11_ITEM8_P53_S2	It also notified its insurance carriers of the release and the damage to the tank.
202947_11_ITEM8_P54_S0	The tank was emptied of product and the cleaning of the tank bottom was completed by September 11, 2010.
202947_11_ITEM8_P54_S1	The petroleum-contaminated water released from the tank was contained on the secondary containment liner under the tank bottom, preventing contamination of the groundwater.
202947_11_ITEM8_P54_S2	The Company engaged an outside engineering firm to inspect the tank bottom to determine the cause and location of the release, as well as the extent of the required repairs.
202947_11_ITEM8_P54_S3	The findings of the inspection indicated that aggressive corrosion from inside the tank occurred, causing two holes in the immediate vicinity of the observed release, as well as several other holes or potential holes in other areas of the tank bottom.
202947_11_ITEM8_P54_S4	The report indicates that the corrosion was caused by microbial contamination, which was affirmed by a corrosion specialist.
202947_11_ITEM8_P55_S0	The total cost of the cleanup, inspection and repair of the tank was $550,000 (of which $273,000 has been paid through December 31, 2010), which amount is included in petroleum storage facility expenses on the accompanying consolidated statement of income and retained earnings for the year ended December 31, 2010.
202947_11_ITEM8_P55_S1	The tank was placed back in service in February 2011.
202947_11_ITEM8_P56_S0	The testing of certain of the Company s other tanks revealed the presence of corrosive microbial contaminants in Tanks 151 and 32.
202947_11_ITEM8_P56_S1	Both tanks were treated with a biocide and continue to be monitored and treated as necessary.
202947_11_ITEM8_P56_S2	Since Tank 32 had been inspected in June 2010, the Company believes that the contaminants have not affected the integrity of this tank bottom.
202947_11_ITEM8_P56_S3	However, since Tank 151 had not been inspected since construction in 2006, the Company took this tank out of service in February 2011 for approximately one month for a complete inspection of the tank bottom.
202947_11_ITEM8_P57_S0	At this time, management does not know which costs, if any, will be recovered under its insurance policies; however, the Company has put its insurance carrier on notice under the property policy with its insurance carrier to recover the repair costs.
202947_11_ITEM8_P57_S1	The deductibles on the Company s insurance policies are $50,000 for environmental and $75,000 for property.
202947_11_ITEM8_P57_S2	In addition, the Company is reviewing all of the facts and circumstances to determine if it has a claim against third parties for costs of cleanup, inspection and repair.
202947_11_ITEM8_P57_S3	The Company cannot determine with any certainty what amount may be recovered from a third party and, accordingly, has not recorded any receivable at December 31, 2010.
202947_11_ITEM8_P58_S0	In 2002, during testing of monitoring wells at the Terminal, the Company s consulting engineer discovered free floating phase product in a groundwater monitoring well located on that portion of the Terminal purchased in 2000.
202947_11_ITEM8_P58_S1	Laboratory analysis indicated that the product was gasoline, which is not a product the Company ever stored at the Terminal.
202947_11_ITEM8_P58_S2	The Company commenced an environmental investigation and analysis, the results of which indicate that the gasoline did not come from the Terminal.
202947_11_ITEM8_P58_S3	RIDEM subsequently identified Power Test Realty Partnership (Power Test), the owner of an adjacent parcel, as a potentially responsible party for the contamination.
202947_11_ITEM8_P58_S4	Getty Properties Corp. is the general partner of Power Test.
202947_11_ITEM8_P59_S0	Power Test challenged that determination and, after an administrative hearing, on October 20, 2008, a RIDEM Hearing Officer determined that Power Test is responsible for the discharge of the petroleum product under the Rhode Island Oil Pollution Control Act, R.I.G.L. Section 46-12.5.1-3 and Rule 6(a) and 12(b) of the Oil Pollution Control Regulations.
202947_11_ITEM8_P59_S1	The RIDEM Decision and Order requires Power Test to remediate the contamination as directed by RIDEM and remanded the proposed penalty to RIDEM for recalculation.
202947_11_ITEM8_P59_S2	In November 2008, Power Test appealed the decision to the Rhode Island Superior Court.
202947_11_ITEM8_P59_S3	In addition, in November 2008, Power Test sought, and received, a stay of the Decision and Order of the Hearing Officer pending a clarification by RIDEM of the amount of the proposed penalty.
202947_11_ITEM8_P59_S4	On October 2, 2009, RIDEM issued a recalculated administrative penalty, and, subsequently, the RIDEM Hearing Officer issued a recommended amended decision, which was affirmed as a final decision by the RIDEM Director on December 23, 2009.
202947_11_ITEM8_P59_S5	On January 20, 2010, Power Test appealed that decision to Superior Court.
202947_11_ITEM8_P59_S6	There can be no assurance that the Superior Court will affirm the final RIDEM decision.
202947_11_ITEM8_P60_S0	In April 2009, the Company sued Power Test and Getty Properties Corp. in the Rhode Island Superior Court seeking remediation of the site or, in the alternative, the cost of the remediation.
202947_11_ITEM8_P60_S1	On May 1, 2009, Power Test and Getty Properties Corp. removed the action to the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island.
202947_11_ITEM8_P61_S0	On May 22, 2009, Power Test and Getty Properties Corp. answered the Complaint and filed a Counterclaim against Dunellen, LLC and Capital Terminal Company alleging that Dunellen, LLC and Capital Terminal Company are responsible for the contamination.
202947_11_ITEM8_P61_S1	Getty Properties Corp. and Power Test have joined Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc., the tenant under a long-term lease with Getty Properties Corp. of the adjacent property, as a defendant.
202947_11_ITEM8_P61_S2	The Company has amended its Complaint to add Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. as a defendant.
202947_11_ITEM8_P62_S0	In February 2011, the Company was notified by the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island that the case was being transferred to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire due to a backlog of cases in Rhode Island.
202947_11_ITEM8_P63_S0	The parties are now engaged in discovery.
202947_11_ITEM8_P63_S1	There can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in this litigation.
202947_11_ITEM8_P64_S0	Since January 2003, the Company has not incurred significant costs in connection with this matter, other than ongoing litigation costs, and is unable to determine the costs it might incur to remedy the situation, as well as any costs to investigate, defend and seek reimbursement from the responsible party with respect to this contamination.
202947_11_ITEM8_P65_S0	In 1994, a leak was discovered in a 25,000 barrel storage tank at the Terminal which allowed the escape of a small amount of fuel oil.
202947_11_ITEM8_P65_S1	All required notices were made to RIDEM.
202947_11_ITEM8_P65_S2	In 2000, the tank was demolished and testing of the groundwater indicated that there was no large pooling of contaminants.
202947_11_ITEM8_P66_S0	In 2001, RIDEM approved a plan pursuant to which the Company installed a passive system consisting of three wells and commenced monitoring the wells.
202947_11_ITEM8_P67_S0	In 2003, RIDEM decided that the passive monitoring system previously approved was not sufficient and required the Company to design an active remediation system for the removal of product from the contaminated site.
202947_11_ITEM8_P67_S1	The Company and its consulting engineers began the pre-design testing of the site in the fourth quarter of 2004.
202947_11_ITEM8_P67_S2	The consulting engineers estimated a total cost of $200,000 to design, install and operate the system, which amount was accrued in 2004.
202947_11_ITEM8_P67_S3	Through 2006, the Company had expended $119,000 and has not incurred any additional costs since then.
202947_11_ITEM8_P67_S4	RIDEM has not taken any action on the Company s proposed plan.
202947_11_ITEM8_P68_S0	As designed, the system will pump out the contaminants which will be disposed of in compliance with applicable regulations.
202947_11_ITEM8_P68_S1	After a period of time, the groundwater will be tested to determine if sufficient contaminants have been removed.
202947_11_ITEM8_P68_S2	While the Company and its consulting engineers believe that the proposed active remediation system will correct the situation, it is possible that RIDEM could require the Company to expand remediation efforts, which could result in the Company incurring additional costs.
202947_11_ITEM8_P69_S0	The Pier is a deep-water pier in East Providence, Rhode Island owned by the Company which is integral to the operation of the Terminal.
202947_11_ITEM8_P69_S1	The Pier and the Terminal are connected by two petroleum pipelines which the Company has a permanent right to use.
202947_11_ITEM8_P70_S0	In 1995, the Company and Providence and Worcester Railroad Company (the Railroad ) (the then owner of the Pier) entered into an agreement which, among other things, gave the Company the right to acquire the Pier for One Dollar ($1.00).
202947_11_ITEM8_P70_S1	The Company acquired the Pier from the Railroad in 1998.
202947_11_ITEM8_P70_S2	The Company and the Railroad have a common controlling shareholder.
202947_11_ITEM8_P71_S0	Income tax expense is comprised of the following components:
202947_11_ITEM8_P72_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2010, the income tax provision does not bear the customary relationship between tax expense and pretax accounting income.
202947_11_ITEM8_P72_S1	The Company has determined that certain expenditures in connection with the historic restoration of the Steeple Street Building qualify for federal historic income tax credits in 2010 of $588,000, which credits were used in determining the Company s current federal income tax provision for 2010 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
202947_11_ITEM8_P72_S2	Of the total amount, $556,000 was used to reduce the current provision and the remaining $32,000 was used to reduce the deferred tax provision.
202947_11_ITEM8_P73_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, a reconciliation of the income tax provision as computed by applying the United States income tax rate (34%) to income before income taxes is as follows:
202947_11_ITEM8_P74_S0	Deferred income taxes are recorded based upon differences between financial statement and tax basis amounts of assets and liabilities.
202947_11_ITEM8_P74_S1	The tax effects of temporary differences which give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:
202947_11_ITEM8_P75_S0	In November 2008, the Company restated its Articles of Incorporation:
202947_11_ITEM8_P76_S0	To provide for certain transfer and ownership restrictions as set forth therein.
202947_11_ITEM8_P77_S0	In December 2008, the Company issued (in the form of a stock dividend) 3,299,956 shares of Class B Common Stock on a one-for-one basis for each share of Class A Common Stock held.
202947_11_ITEM8_P78_S0	The holders of Class A and Class B Common Stock vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to the shareholders of the Company except for the election of the Board of Directors and except in connection with certain major corporate actions, including a sale of the Company.
202947_11_ITEM8_P78_S1	The holders of Class A Common Stock, voting as a separate class, elect one-third of the Board of Directors.
202947_11_ITEM8_P78_S2	The holders of Class B Common Stock, voting as a separate class, elect the remainder of the Board of Directors.
202947_11_ITEM8_P79_S0	Class B Common Stock is convertible by the record owner thereof into the same number of shares of Class A Common Stock at any time.
202947_11_ITEM8_P79_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the number of shares converted were 74,860 shares and 354,783 shares, respectively.
202947_11_ITEM8_P80_S0	The Class A Common Stock is listed on the Premier QX Tier of the OTCQX.
202947_11_ITEM8_P80_S1	The Class B Common Stock is not listed on any national or regional stock exchange, or on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation National Market System or on the OTCQX.
202947_11_ITEM8_P81_S0	The holders of Class A and Class B Common Stock share equally in the earnings of the Company and in dividends declared by the Company.
202947_11_ITEM8_P82_S0	The Company s Restated Articles of Incorporation prohibits any shareholder from acquiring more than a 5% interest in the Company s classes of common stock and prohibits any shareholder or any beneficial owner who, at the time of the filing of the Restated Articles of Incorporation owned 5% or more of the Company s classes of common stock from increasing their aggregate percentage ownership of both classes of common stock.
202947_11_ITEM8_P82_S1	Should a shareholder acquire a number of shares that results in the limitation being exceeded, shares in excess of the limitation would be automatically converted into an equal number of shares of Excess Stock, which class was authorized pursuant to the 2001 Amendment to the Company s Articles of Incorporation.
202947_11_ITEM8_P82_S2	Excess Stock is non-voting and is not entitled to dividends.
202947_11_ITEM8_P82_S3	However, the shareholder may designate a qualifying transferee for shares of Excess Stock, at which time such shares would be converted and reissued as Class A or Class B Common shares as the case may be.
202947_11_ITEM8_P83_S0	The purpose for creating the Class B Common Stock was to put the Company in the position to qualify to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ).
202947_11_ITEM8_P84_S0	of the shares of a company can be held by five or fewer individuals during the last half of each taxable year.
202947_11_ITEM8_P84_S1	Currently, the majority shareholder controls 52.3% of the Company s outstanding common stock and three other shareholders each own more than 5% of the Company s outstanding common stock.
202947_11_ITEM8_P84_S2	In order for the Company to qualify to be taxed as a REIT, the major shareholders ownership of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock would need to be reduced below the 50% level.
202947_11_ITEM8_P85_S0	The Company operates in two segments: (1) Leasing and (2) Petroleum Storage.
202947_11_ITEM8_P86_S0	The Company makes decisions relative to the allocation of resources and evaluates performance based on each segment s respective income before income taxes, excluding interest expense and certain corporate expenses.
202947_11_ITEM8_P87_S0	Inter-segment revenues are immaterial in amount.
202947_11_ITEM8_P88_S0	The following financial information is used for making operating decisions and assessing performance of the Company s segments:
202947_11_ITEM8_P89_S0	The following is a reconciliation of the segment information to the amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements:
202947_11_ITEM8_P90_S0	The following table sets forth those customers whose revenues exceed 10% of the Company s segment revenues:
202947_11_ITEM8_P91_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company increased its estimate for the repair of Tank 153 by $343,000.
202947_11_ITEM8_P91_S1	Unexpected changes in construction methods and procedures were required due to site and tank conditions not originally identifiable.
202947_11_ITEM8_P91_S2	Inclement weather caused further delay and expense.
202947_11_ITEM8_P92_S0	Also during the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company s annual effective income tax rate decreased 9.4 percent from that used in the quarterly periods in 2010, due to the lower pre-tax income than projected and a higher historic tax credit than was previously estimated.
202947_11_ITEM8_P92_S1	As a result, the income tax provision as previously reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, was overstated by $142,000.
202947_11_ITEM8_P93_S0	The Company evaluated subsequent events through the date the financial statements were issued.
202947_11_ITEM9_P0_S0	There were no changes in, or disagreements with, accountants on accounting or financial disclosure as defined by Item 304 of Regulation S-K.
202947_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Under the supervision of the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report.
202947_11_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of such date, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in making them aware on a timely basis of the material information relating to the Company required to be included in the Company s periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
202947_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act).
202947_11_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Company s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of its financial reporting and the preparation of published financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
202947_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	However, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
202947_11_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
202947_11_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies may deteriorate.
202947_11_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Management conducted its evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) as of December 31, 2010.
202947_11_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Based on this assessment, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer believe that as of December 31, 2010, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on criteria set forth by COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.
202947_11_ITEM9A_P5_S0	This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
202947_11_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report.
202947_11_ITEM9A_P6_S0	During the quarter ended December 31, 2010, there has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

202947_12_ITEM2_P1_S1	In 2006, the Company completed the development of the land currently owned by the Company at the Terminal.

202947_12_ITEM5_P1_S0	Information with respect to the high and low trading prices for the Class B Common Stock is not available because the stock is not listed on any exchange, is not quoted by any quotation service, and there is no known market for such Class B Common Stock.
202947_12_ITEM5_P1_S1	At March 1, 2012, there were 655 holders of record of the Company s Class A Common Stock and 548 holders of record of the Company s Class B Common Stock.
202947_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	Critical accounting policies: The Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) has issued guidance for the disclosure of critical accounting policies.
202947_12_ITEM7_P0_S1	The SEC defines such policies as those that require application of management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.
202947_12_ITEM7_P0_S2	The Company s significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
202947_12_ITEM7_P0_S3	Not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates.
202947_12_ITEM7_P0_S4	Management believes that the Company s revenue recognition policy for long-term leases with scheduled rent increases (leasing segment) meets the SEC definition of critical.
202947_12_ITEM7_P0_S5	Certain of the Company s long-term land leases have original terms of 30 to 149 years and contain scheduled rent increases where the future dollar increases are known at the time of the commencement of the lease or at a subsequent date.
202947_12_ITEM7_P0_S6	The first such lease commenced in 1988, had an original term of 99 years and provides for fixed percentage increases at specified intervals (as well as reappraisal increases).
202947_12_ITEM7_P0_S7	In accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles in accounting for leases, rental income related to the fixed percentage increases that are presently known should be recognized on a straight-line basis.
202947_12_ITEM7_P0_S8	To calculate the annual straight-line amount, the 99 known annual rental amounts are totaled and this total is divided by 99.
202947_12_ITEM7_P0_S9	In 2009, a scheduled appraisal occurred, resulting in a rental increase.
202947_12_ITEM7_P0_S10	The Company recalculated the future annual straight-line amount using the remaining years under the lease.
202947_12_ITEM7_P0_S11	The turnaround date discussed below did not change.
202947_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	For this lease, the calculated annual straight-line amount for 1988 was eight times (multiple) the amount paid by the tenant under the terms of the lease (the contractual amount ).
202947_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	In subsequent years, as the tenant pays higher rents, the multiple gradually decreases until the 57 th year of the lease, at which time the contractual amount paid by the tenant will exceed the calculated straight-line amount.
202947_12_ITEM7_P1_S2	If the Company were to report annual revenue for this lease using the straight-line amount, it would record a significant receivable for each of the first 56 years, which receivable would grow to approximately $34,000,000.
202947_12_ITEM7_P1_S3	Management does not believe that the Company should record a receivable that would not begin to be collected until the 56 th year (the turnaround date ) since management could not be assured of collection.
202947_12_ITEM7_P1_S4	In 1988, management met with the SEC accounting staff to discuss its concerns in applying United States generally accepted accounting principles as they related to a lease of this length which results in the recording of such a significant receivable that would remain on the Company s balance sheet and continue to grow on an annual basis with a turnaround date so far in the future.
202947_12_ITEM7_P1_S5	The Company presented the SEC accounting staff with an application of the accounting policy whereby management would evaluate the collectability of the receivable on an annual basis and report as leasing revenue only that portion of the receivable that management could presently conclude would be collectible.
202947_12_ITEM7_P1_S6	The SEC accounting staff did not object to this application by the Company.
202947_12_ITEM7_P1_S7	Through December 31, 2011, the receivable on this lease has grown to $20,009,000 (cumulative excess of straight-line over contractual rentals) and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround date is still 34 years away.
202947_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	In 2004, a second such lease commenced with an original term of 149 years and provides for fixed minimum percentage increases at specified intervals (as well as reappraisal increases).
202947_12_ITEM7_P2_S1	For this lease, the contractual amount paid by the tenant will not exceed the calculated straight-line amount until the 94 th year of the lease.
202947_12_ITEM7_P2_S2	Through December 31, 2011, the receivable on this lease is $18,197,000 (cumulative excess of straight-line over contractual rentals) and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround date is 86 years away.
202947_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	In 2006, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Agreement of its lease with Lamar Outdoor Advertising LLC ( Lamar ) with a current remaining term of 22 years which provides for fixed percentage increases annually.
202947_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	For this lease, the contractual amount paid by Lamar will not exceed the calculated straight-line amount until the 16 th year of the lease.
202947_12_ITEM7_P3_S2	Through December 31, 2011, the receivable on this lease is $1,205,000 (cumulative excess of straight-line over contractual rentals) and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround date is 10 years away.
202947_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	Accordingly, the Company has not reported any portion of these amounts as leasing revenue in its consolidated financial statements and does not anticipate that it can reach such a conclusion until the turnaround dates are closer.
202947_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	Although the Company s other long-term land leases provide for scheduled rent increases, the provisions of the leases are such that certain future dollar amounts could not be calculated either at the time of the commencement of the lease or now, as such amounts are based on factors that are not presently known, i.e., future cost-of-living adjustments or future appraised values.
202947_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	Through December 31, 2011, the receivable on these leases is $10,109,000 and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround dates are approximately 49 years away.
202947_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	Segments: The Company operates in two segments: leasing and petroleum storage.
202947_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	The leasing segment consists of the long-term leasing of certain of its real estate interests in downtown Providence, Rhode Island (upon the commencement of which the tenants have been required to construct buildings thereon, with the exception of a parking garage), the leasing of a portion of the Steeple Street Building under short-term leasing arrangements and the leasing of locations along interstate and primary highways in Rhode Island and Massachusetts to Lamar which has constructed outdoor advertising boards thereon.
202947_12_ITEM7_P5_S2	The Company anticipates that the future development of its remaining properties in and adjacent to the Capital Center area will consist primarily of long-term ground leases.
202947_12_ITEM7_P5_S3	Pending this development, the Company leases these parcels for public parking under short-term leasing arrangements to Metropark.
202947_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	The petroleum storage segment consists of operating the Facility in East Providence, Rhode Island, for Global Companies, LLC ( Global ).
202947_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	The principal difference between the two segments relates to the nature of the operations.
202947_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	In the leasing segment, the tenants under the long-term land leases incur substantially all of the development and operating costs of the assets constructed on the Company s land, including the payment of real property taxes on both the land and any improvements constructed thereon; whereas the Company is responsible for the operating and maintenance expenditures, including insurance and a portion of the real property taxes, as well as certain capital improvements at the Facility.
202947_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	Results of operations: Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010 Leasing segment: Leasing revenues increased due to scheduled increases in rentals under long-term land leases.
202947_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	Leasing expense increased due to higher depreciation and operating costs associated with the Steeple Street Building, an increase in real property taxes, and the reversal of an allowance for doubtful accounts in 2010 offset by decreases in legal fees in connection with two leases and the termination of one employee in 2010.
202947_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	Petroleum storage facility revenues increased principally due to Global s reimbursement in 2011 of certain costs associated with the cleanup, inspection and repair of Tanks 153 and 151 totaling $511,000.
202947_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	In 2010, costs of $550,000 had been recorded in connection with Tank 153.
202947_12_ITEM7_P9_S2	As a result, petroleum storage facility expense decreased in 2011, offset in part by costs associated with a pipeline breach in August 2011 and tank repairs.
202947_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	General: For the year ended December 31, 2011, general and administrative expense increased $29,000 due to payroll and related costs.
202947_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	Interest expense: In April 2010, the Company borrowed $6,000,000 from a bank.
202947_12_ITEM7_P10_S2	The loan bears interest at an annual rate of 6 percent and has a term of ten years with repayments on a twenty-year amortization schedule (monthly principal payments of $25,000 plus interest) and a balloon payment due in April 2020 when the loan matures.
202947_12_ITEM7_P10_S3	In 2011, the Company made principal payments totaling $1,825,000, including $1,525,000 of prepayments.
202947_12_ITEM7_P10_S4	For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, interest expense was $315,000 and $248,000, respectively.
202947_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	Income taxes: The Company s effective income tax rate for 2011 is 40 percent.
202947_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2010 did not bear the customary relationship between income tax expense and pretax accounting income due to the Company s generation of a federal historic tax credit, resulting in an effective tax rate of 21 percent.
202947_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	Liquidity and capital resources: Historically, the Company has had adequate liquidity to fund its operations.
202947_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	In April 2010, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a special dividend of $5,478,000 ($.83 per common share) on the Class A and Class B common stock to shareholders of record on May 12, 2010 payable on May 26, 2010.
202947_12_ITEM7_P12_S2	The dividend represented the payout to the shareholders of the Company s earnings and profits as calculated for federal income tax purposes at December 31, 2009.
202947_12_ITEM7_P12_S3	The Company has expressed its intention in the future to convert to a pass-through entity for income tax purposes.
202947_12_ITEM7_P12_S4	In order to effectuate such a conversion, the Company will be required to pay out its accumulated earnings and profits.
202947_12_ITEM7_P12_S5	The Board of Directors determined that it would be in the best interest of the shareholders to make the distribution of the earnings and profits while the tax laws were still favorable, since management at that time expected that the federal income tax rate on dividends could rise substantially on January 1, 2011.
202947_12_ITEM7_P12_S6	In order to fund the special dividend, the Company borrowed $6,000,000 from a bank.
202947_12_ITEM7_P12_S7	The loan bears interest at an annual rate of 6 percent and has a term of ten years with repayments on a twenty-year amortization schedule (monthly principal payments of $25,000 plus interest) and a balloon payment due in April 2020 when the loan matures.
202947_12_ITEM7_P12_S8	The note further contains the customary covenants, terms and conditions, and permits prepayment, in whole or in part, at any time without penalty if the prepayment is made from internally generated funds.
202947_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	As collateral for the loan, the Company granted the bank a mortgage on Parcels 3S and 5 in the Capital Center.
202947_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	During 2011, the Company s operating activities provided an additional $3,072,000 of cash.
202947_12_ITEM7_P13_S2	The Company made cash payments of $1,825,000 in principal payments on the note payable (including $1,525,000 in prepayments), $792,000 for dividends and $553,000 for properties and equipment.
202947_12_ITEM7_P13_S3	Cash decreased $217,000 from the 2010 level.
202947_12_ITEM7_P13_S4	Cash and cash commitments: At December 31, 2011, the Company had cash of $2,178,000.
202947_12_ITEM7_P13_S5	The Company maintains all of its cash in a non-interest bearing checking account which is fully insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
202947_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	Under the lease which commenced in 2005, the tenant is entitled to a credit for future rents equal to a portion of the real property taxes paid by the tenant through April 2007.
202947_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	In connection with Phase I of the tenant s project, commencing July 1, 2010, the annual rent increased from $48,000 to $300,000.
202947_12_ITEM7_P14_S2	As a result of the rent credit, the tenant will not be required to make cash payments for Phase I rent until March 2012.
202947_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	Commencing July 1, 2010, the Company reclassifies each month $25,000 of deferred leasing revenues to leasing revenues.

202947_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	The current economic conditions have had limited impact on the Company s results of operations to date.
202947_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	As none of the Company s leases require the tenant to provide financial information, the Company has no information concerning the impact of current economic conditions on its major tenants and, therefore, cannot predict whether any tenants will request concessions.
202947_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	In December 2010, the Company completed the historic renovation of the Steeple Street Building, including the related utility infrastructure, at a total cost of $3,369,000.
202947_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	The Company determined that certain expenditures qualified for federal historic tax credits in 2010 totaling $588,000.

202947_12_ITEM7_P17_S3	At December 31, 2011, the Company has three tenants in a portion of the Steeple Street Building under short-term leases (five years or less) at a current annual rental of $119,000.

202947_12_ITEM7_P18_S1	See Part I , Item 1, Petroleum Storage, Environmental .
202947_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	In 2011, the Company prepaid $1,525,000 on its note payable, resulting in a future annual savings of $92,000 in interest expense.
202947_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	Any additional prepayments will depend on the Company s level of available cash.
202947_12_ITEM7_P19_S2	In January 2012, the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $198,000 ($.03 per common share) which was paid in February 2012.
202947_12_ITEM7_P19_S3	The declaration of future dividends and the amount thereof will depend on the Company s future earnings, financial factors and other events.
202947_12_ITEM7_P19_S4	The Company expects that cash generated from current operations will continue to be sufficient to meet operating expenses, debt service, ordinary capital expenditures, unanticipated events at the Terminal and the current level of quarterly dividends.
202947_12_ITEM7_P19_S5	In the event temporary liquidity is required, the Company believes that a line of credit or other arrangements could be obtained by pledging some or all of its unencumbered assets as collateral.
202947_12_ITEM7_P19_S6	At December 31, 2011, the Company has no non-cancellable contract obligations other than two operating leases for billboard locations for which the rent expense is not material in amount.
202947_12_ITEM8_P0_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors Capital Properties, Inc.
202947_12_ITEM8_P0_S1	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Capital Properties, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income and retained earnings, and cash flows for the years then ended.
202947_12_ITEM8_P0_S2	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
202947_12_ITEM8_P0_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
202947_12_ITEM8_P0_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
202947_12_ITEM8_P0_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
202947_12_ITEM8_P0_S6	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
202947_12_ITEM8_P0_S7	An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
202947_12_ITEM8_P0_S8	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
202947_12_ITEM8_P1_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
202947_12_ITEM8_P1_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
202947_12_ITEM8_P1_S2	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Capital Properties, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
202947_12_ITEM8_P2_S0	See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.
202947_12_ITEM8_P3_S0	See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.
202947_12_ITEM8_P4_S0	See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.
202947_12_ITEM8_P5_S0	Description of business: Capital Properties, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Tri-State Displays, Inc., Capital Terminal Company and Dunellen, LLC (collectively referred to as the Company ) operate in two segments, leasing and petroleum storage.
202947_12_ITEM8_P5_S1	The leasing segment consists of the long-term leasing of certain of its real estate interests in downtown Providence, Rhode Island (upon the commencement of which the tenants are required to construct buildings thereon, with the exception of a parking garage), the leasing of a portion of its building ( Steeple Street Building ) under short-term leasing arrangements and the leasing of locations along interstate and primary highways in Rhode Island and Massachusetts to Lamar Outdoor Advertising, LLC ( Lamar ) which has constructed outdoor advertising boards thereon.
202947_12_ITEM8_P5_S2	The Company anticipates that the future development of its remaining properties in and adjacent to the Capital Center area will consist primarily of long-term ground leases.
202947_12_ITEM8_P5_S3	Pending this development, the Company leases these parcels for public parking under short-term leasing arrangements to Metropark, Ltd. ( Metropark ).
202947_12_ITEM8_P6_S0	The petroleum storage segment consists of operating the petroleum storage terminal (the Terminal ) and the Wilkesbarre Pier (the Pier ), both of which are owned by the Company and are collectively referred to as the Facility, located in East Providence, Rhode Island, for Global Companies, LLC ( Global ) which stores and distributes petroleum products.
202947_12_ITEM8_P6_S1	The principal difference between the two segments relates to the nature of the operations.
202947_12_ITEM8_P7_S0	In the leasing segment, the tenants under long-term land leases incur substantially all of the development and operating costs of the assets constructed on the Company s land, including the payment of real property taxes on both the land and any improvements constructed thereon; whereas the Company is responsible for the operating and maintenance expenditures, including insurance and a portion of the real property taxes, as well as certain capital improvements at the Facility.
202947_12_ITEM8_P8_S0	Summary of significant accounting policies: Principles of consolidation: The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts and transactions of the Company and its subsidiaries.
202947_12_ITEM8_P8_S1	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
202947_12_ITEM8_P9_S0	Use of estimates: The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.
202947_12_ITEM8_P9_S1	Estimates also affect the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.
202947_12_ITEM8_P9_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
202947_12_ITEM8_P10_S0	Fair value of financial instruments: The Company believes that the fair values of its financial instruments, including cash, receivables and payables, approximate their respective book values because of their short-term nature.
202947_12_ITEM8_P10_S1	The fair value of the note payable approximates its book value and was determined using borrowing rates currently available to the Company for loans with similar terms and maturities.
202947_12_ITEM8_P11_S0	Properties and equipment: Properties and equipment are stated at cost.
202947_12_ITEM8_P11_S1	Acquisitions and additions are capitalized while routine maintenance and repairs, which do not improve the asset or extend its life, are charged to expense when incurred.
202947_12_ITEM8_P11_S2	Depreciation is being provided by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.
202947_12_ITEM8_P12_S0	The Company follows United States generally accepted accounting principles when accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, which requires that properties and equipment held and used by the Company be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value of the asset may not be recoverable.
202947_12_ITEM8_P12_S1	An impairment loss will be recognized if the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and before interest) from the use of the asset is less than the net book value of the asset.
202947_12_ITEM8_P12_S2	Generally, the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the estimated fair value of the asset.
202947_12_ITEM8_P13_S0	Cash and cash equivalents: The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
202947_12_ITEM8_P13_S1	At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had no cash equivalents.
202947_12_ITEM8_P13_S2	The Company maintains all of its cash in non-interest bearing checking accounts in one bank which are fully insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
202947_12_ITEM8_P14_S0	Environmental incidents: The Company accrues a liability when an environmental incident has occurred and the costs are estimable.
202947_12_ITEM8_P14_S1	The Company does not record a receivable for recoveries from third parties for environmental matters until it has determined that the amount of the collection is reasonably assured.
202947_12_ITEM8_P14_S2	The accrued liability is relieved when the Company pays the liability or a third party assumes the liability.
202947_12_ITEM8_P14_S3	Upon determination that collection is reasonably assured or a third party assumes the liability, the Company records the amount as a reduction of expense.
202947_12_ITEM8_P15_S0	The Company charges to expense those costs that do not extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of the property owned or used by the Company.
202947_12_ITEM8_P16_S0	Revenues: Leasing The Company s properties leased to others are under operating leases.
202947_12_ITEM8_P16_S1	The Company reports leasing revenue when earned under the operating method.
202947_12_ITEM8_P16_S2	Certain of the Company s long-term land leases, including the outdoor advertising locations, provide for presently known scheduled rent increases over the remaining terms (22 to 143 years).
202947_12_ITEM8_P16_S3	The Company follows United States generally accepted accounting principles in accounting for leases by recognizing leasing revenue on the straight-line basis over the terms of the leases; however, the Company does not report as revenue that portion of such straight-line rentals which management is unable to conclude is realizable (collectible) due to the length of the lease terms and other related uncertainties.
202947_12_ITEM8_P17_S0	Petroleum storage facility The Company reports revenue from the operations of the Facility when earned and reports as revenue the tenant s portion of the real property taxes and certain other items as required by the lease.
202947_12_ITEM8_P17_S1	Contingent The Company reports contingent revenue in the period in which the factors occur on which the contingent payments are predicated.
202947_12_ITEM8_P18_S0	Income taxes: The Company and its subsidiaries file consolidated income tax returns.
202947_12_ITEM8_P18_S1	The Company provides for income taxes based on income reported for financial reporting purposes.
202947_12_ITEM8_P18_S2	The provision for income taxes differs from the amounts currently payable because of temporary differences associated with the recognition of certain income and expense items for financial reporting and tax reporting purposes.
202947_12_ITEM8_P18_S3	The Company follows United States generally accepted accounting principles in accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.
202947_12_ITEM8_P18_S4	Based on its evaluation, the Company has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the consolidated financial statements.
202947_12_ITEM8_P18_S5	The Company will report any tax-related interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.
202947_12_ITEM8_P19_S0	Legal fees: The Company recognizes legal fees as incurred.
202947_12_ITEM8_P20_S0	Basic earnings per common share: Basic earnings per common share are computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
202947_12_ITEM8_P21_S0	New accounting standards: The Company reviews new accounting standards as issued.
202947_12_ITEM8_P21_S1	Although some of these accounting standards may be applicable to the Company, the Company has not identified any standards that it believes merit further discussion.
202947_12_ITEM8_P21_S2	The Company expects that none of the new standards will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
202947_12_ITEM8_P22_S0	Properties and equipment: Properties and equipment consist of the following:
202947_12_ITEM8_P23_S0	4. Note payable: In April 2010, the Company borrowed $6,000,000 from a bank.
202947_12_ITEM8_P23_S1	The loan bears interest an annual rate of 6 percent and has a term of ten years with repayments on a twenty-year amortization schedule (monthly principal payments of $25,000 plus interest) and a balloon payment of $1,500,000 due April 2020 when the loan matures.
202947_12_ITEM8_P23_S2	The note further contains the customary covenants, terms and conditions and permits prepayment, in whole or in part, at any time without penalty if the prepayment is made from internally generated funds.
202947_12_ITEM8_P24_S0	As collateral for the loan, the Company granted the bank a mortgage on Parcels 3S and 5 in the Capital Center.
202947_12_ITEM8_P24_S1	In May 2010, the proceeds from the loan were used principally to fund a special dividend of $5,478,000 to shareholders, which represented the Company s earnings and profits as calculated for federal income tax purposes at December 31, 2009.
202947_12_ITEM8_P24_S2	In 2011, the Company made principal prepayments totaling $1,525,000.
202947_12_ITEM8_P24_S3	The following is a schedule of principal payments for the remaining term of the note payable: In connection with the borrowing, the Company incurred financing fees totaling $55,000, which are being amortized by the straight-method over the 10-year term of the note (which approximates the effective interest rate method) and are included in interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of income and retained earnings.
202947_12_ITEM8_P25_S0	Description of leasing arrangements: Long-term land leases: As of December 31, 2011, the Company had entered into six long-term land leases for six separate parcels upon which the improvements have been completed ( developed parcels ).
202947_12_ITEM8_P25_S1	In addition, in 2005 a long-term land lease commenced on an undeveloped parcel on which two residential buildings were planned.
202947_12_ITEM8_P25_S2	One building was completed in September 2009.
202947_12_ITEM8_P25_S3	The other building has not progressed beyond the early stages of site preparation, and the timing of its construction and completion is uncertain.
202947_12_ITEM8_P25_S4	Under two of the long-term land leases, the Company receives contingent rentals (based upon a fixed percentage of gross revenue received by the tenants) which totaled $64,000 and $55,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
202947_12_ITEM8_P25_S5	Under the seven land leases, the tenants are required to negotiate any tax stabilization treaty or other arrangements, appeal any changes in real property assessments, and pay real property taxes assessed on land and improvements under these arrangements.
202947_12_ITEM8_P25_S6	Accordingly, real property taxes payable by the tenants are excluded from leasing revenues and leasing expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of income and retained earnings.
202947_12_ITEM8_P25_S7	For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the real property taxes attributable to the Company s land under these seven leases are $1,247,000 and $1,109,000, respectively.
202947_12_ITEM8_P26_S0	Under the lease which commenced in 2005, the tenant is entitled to a credit for future rents equal to a portion of the real property taxes paid by the tenant through April 2007.
202947_12_ITEM8_P26_S1	In connection with Phase I of the tenant s project, commencing July 1, 2010, the annual rent increased from $48,000 to $300,000.
202947_12_ITEM8_P26_S2	As a result of the rent credit, the tenant will not be required to make cash payments for Phase I rent until March 2012.
202947_12_ITEM8_P27_S0	Commencing July 1, 2010, the Company reclassifies each month $25,000 of deferred leasing revenues to leasing revenues.

202947_12_ITEM8_P27_S2	The Company also leases various parcels of land for outdoor advertising purposes to Lamar under a lease having a remaining term of 22 years.
202947_12_ITEM8_P27_S3	The lease provides, among other things, the following: (1) the base rent will increase annually in fixed increases of 2.75% for each leased billboard location commencing June 1, 2006 and on each June 1 thereafter; and (2) in addition to base rent, for each 12-month period commencing each June 1, Lamar must pay to the Company the difference between 30% of the gross revenues from each standard billboard and 20% of the gross revenues from each electronic billboard for such 12-month period reduced by the sum of (a) commissions paid to third parties and (b) the base monthly rent for each leased billboard display for such 12-month period ( contingent revenue ).
202947_12_ITEM8_P27_S4	For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, contingent revenues totaled $92,000 and $55,000, respectively.

202947_12_ITEM8_P29_S0	For those leases with presently known scheduled rent increases at December 31, 2011 and 2010, the cumulative excess of straight-line over contractual rentals (considering scheduled rent increases over the 30 to 149 year terms of the leases) and the portion of the excess of straight-line over contractual rentals which management has concluded is realizable when payable over the terms of the leases are as follows:
202947_12_ITEM8_P30_S0	In the event of tenant default, the Company has the right to reclaim its leased land together with any improvements thereon, subject to the right of any leasehold mortgagee to enter into a new lease with the Company with the same terms and conditions as the lease in default.
202947_12_ITEM8_P31_S0	Short-term leases: The Company leases the undeveloped parcels of land in or adjacent to the Capital Center area for public parking purposes to Metropark, Ltd. under a short-term cancellable lease.

202947_12_ITEM8_P39_S0	ULSD incident (2011): In March 2011, management learned that, during the normal receipt of product from a barge, No. 2 heating oil (high sulfur heating oil) was accidentally pumped into one of the Company s ULSD petroleum storage tanks (Tank 67), resulting in a mixture with a sulfur content in excess of that allowed by the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ).
202947_12_ITEM8_P39_S1	The Company notified Global and its insurance carriers of the incident.
202947_12_ITEM8_P39_S2	Global informed the Company that it had contacted its customers that received the mixture and commenced a sampling and testing program with certain of its customers to determine (1) if any product should be removed and replaced with conforming product or (2) if the product need only be treated to meet the EPA requirements.
202947_12_ITEM8_P40_S0	In August 2011, Global asserted a claim against the Company of $132,000 for damages incurred by Global arising out of the incident, which amount was accrued as an expense at September 30, 2011.
202947_12_ITEM8_P40_S1	At December 31, 2011, the Company determined that its insurance carrier had assumed this liability, and the Company reduced the previously recorded liability and expense by that amount.
202947_12_ITEM8_P40_S2	In March 2012, the Company s insurance carrier paid Global the full amount of its claim, and Global released the Company of all liability relating to this incident.
202947_12_ITEM8_P41_S0	Tank 153 (2010): On August 30, 2010, during a regular facility inspection of the Terminal, a release of petroleum-contaminated water was discovered from the tank bottom of one of the Company s 150,000 barrel tanks (Tank 153).
202947_12_ITEM8_P41_S1	The Company notified the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management ( RIDEM ), the EPA and the United States Coast Guard.
202947_12_ITEM8_P41_S2	It also notified its insurance carriers of the release and the damage to the tank.
202947_12_ITEM8_P41_S3	The tank was emptied of product and the cleaning of the tank bottom was completed in September 2010.
202947_12_ITEM8_P41_S4	The petroleum-contaminated water released from the tank was contained on the secondary containment liner under the tank bottom, preventing contamination of the groundwater.
202947_12_ITEM8_P41_S5	The Company engaged an outside engineering firm to inspect the tank bottom to determine the cause and location of the release, as well as the extent of the required repairs.
202947_12_ITEM8_P41_S6	The findings of the inspection indicated that aggressive corrosion from inside the tank occurred, causing two holes in the immediate vicinity of the observed release, as well as several other holes or potential holes in other areas of the tank bottom.
202947_12_ITEM8_P41_S7	The report concluded that the corrosion was caused by microbial contamination, which was affirmed by a corrosion specialist.
202947_12_ITEM8_P41_S8	The final cost of the cleanup, inspection and repair of the tank was $533,000, all of which was recorded as an expense at December 31, 2010.
202947_12_ITEM8_P41_S9	The tank was placed back in service in February 2011.
202947_12_ITEM8_P41_S10	In June 2011, Global paid the Company $458,000 which is recorded in petroleum storage facility revenues, reimbursement of tank repairs on the accompanying consolidated statement of income and retained earnings for the year ended December 31, 2011 due to the contractual nature of the reimbursement.
202947_12_ITEM8_P41_S11	The difference relates to the $75,000 cost of epoxy coating the bottom of Tank 153 which the Company paid.
202947_12_ITEM8_P42_S0	The testing of certain of the Company s other tanks revealed the presence of corrosive microbial contaminants in Tanks 151 and 32.
202947_12_ITEM8_P42_S1	Both tanks were treated with a biocide and continue to be monitored and treated as necessary.
202947_12_ITEM8_P42_S2	Since Tank 32 had been inspected in June 2010, the Company believes that the contaminants have not affected the integrity of this tank bottom.
202947_12_ITEM8_P42_S3	However, since Tank 151 had not been inspected since construction in 2006, the Company took this tank out of service in February 2011.
202947_12_ITEM8_P42_S4	The tank was emptied of product, and an inspection of the tank bottom revealed minor corrosion.
202947_12_ITEM8_P42_S5	The Company completed the repairs recommended by the inspectors and applied an epoxy coating to the bottom of Tank 151 at a cost of $50,000, which has been included in petroleum storage facility expenses, operating on the accompanying consolidated statement of income and retained earnings for the year ended December 31, 2011.
202947_12_ITEM8_P42_S6	The tank was back in service in May 2011.
202947_12_ITEM8_P42_S7	Exclusive of the epoxy coating, the total cost of cleanup, inspection and repair of the tanks was $40,000 which Global paid the Company in September 2011 and is recorded in petroleum storage facilities revenues, reimbursement of tank repairs on the accompanying consolidated statement of income and retained earnings for the year ended December 31, 2011.
202947_12_ITEM8_P42_S8	Tank repairs related to this incident have been presented as a separate line item within petroleum storage facility expenses on the accompanying consolidated statement of income and retained earnings.
202947_12_ITEM8_P42_S9	Routine tank repairs continue to be included with petroleum storage facility operating expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of income and retained earnings.
202947_12_ITEM8_P43_S0	Environmental incident (2002): In 2002, during testing of monitoring wells at the Terminal, the Company s consulting engineer discovered free floating phase product in a groundwater monitoring well located on that portion of the Terminal purchased in 2000.
202947_12_ITEM8_P43_S1	Laboratory analysis indicated that the product was gasoline, which is not a product the Company ever stored at the Terminal.
202947_12_ITEM8_P43_S2	The Company commenced an environmental investigation and analysis, the results of which indicate that the gasoline did not come from the Terminal.
202947_12_ITEM8_P43_S3	RIDEM subsequently identified Power Test Realty Partnership ( Power Test ), the owner of an adjacent parcel, as a potentially responsible party for the contamination.
202947_12_ITEM8_P43_S4	Getty Properties Corp. is the general partner of Power Test.
202947_12_ITEM8_P44_S0	Power Test challenged that determination and, after an administrative hearing, in October 2008 a RIDEM Hearing Officer determined that Power Test is responsible for the discharge of the petroleum product under the Rhode Island Oil Pollution Control Act, R.I.G.L. Section 46-12.5.1-3 and Rule 6(a) and 12(b) of the Oil Pollution Control Regulations.
202947_12_ITEM8_P44_S1	The RIDEM Decision and Order requires Power Test to remediate the contamination as directed by RIDEM and remanded the proposed penalty to RIDEM for recalculation.
202947_12_ITEM8_P44_S2	In November 2008, Power Test appealed the decision to the Rhode Island Superior Court.
202947_12_ITEM8_P44_S3	In addition, in November 2008, Power Test sought, and received, a stay of the Decision and Order of the Hearing Officer pending a clarification by RIDEM of the amount of the proposed penalty.
202947_12_ITEM8_P44_S4	In October 2009, RIDEM issued a recalculated administrative penalty, and, subsequently, the RIDEM Hearing Officer issued a recommended amended decision, which was affirmed as a final decision by the RIDEM Director in December 2009.
202947_12_ITEM8_P44_S5	In January 2010, Power Test appealed that decision to Superior Court.
202947_12_ITEM8_P44_S6	In September 2011, the Superior Court affirmed the decision of the RIDEM director.
202947_12_ITEM8_P44_S7	Power Test has appealed that decision to the Rhode Island Supreme Court.
202947_12_ITEM8_P45_S0	In April 2009, the Company sued Power Test and Getty Properties Corp. in the Rhode Island Superior Court seeking remediation of the site or, in the alternative, the cost of the remediation.
202947_12_ITEM8_P45_S1	On May 1, 2009, Power Test and Getty Properties Corp. removed the action to the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island.
202947_12_ITEM8_P46_S0	On May 22, 2009, Power Test and Getty Properties Corp. answered the Complaint and filed a Counterclaim against Dunellen, LLC and Capital Terminal Company alleging that Dunellen, LLC and Capital Terminal Company are responsible for the contamination.
202947_12_ITEM8_P46_S1	Getty Properties Corp. and Power Test have joined Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc., the tenant under a long-term lease with Getty Properties Corp. of the adjacent property, as a defendant.
202947_12_ITEM8_P46_S2	The Company has amended its Complaint to add Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. as a defendant.
202947_12_ITEM8_P47_S0	On December 5, 2011, Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc., filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
202947_12_ITEM8_P47_S1	The parties are now engaged in discovery.
202947_12_ITEM8_P47_S2	There can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in this litigation.
202947_12_ITEM8_P47_S3	Since January 2003, the Company has not incurred significant costs in connection with this matter, other than ongoing litigation costs, and is unable to determine the costs it might incur to remedy the situation, as well as any costs to investigate, defend and seek reimbursement from the responsible party with respect to this contamination.
202947_12_ITEM8_P48_S0	In 1994, a leak was discovered in a 25,000 barrel storage tank at the Terminal which allowed the escape of a small amount of fuel oil.
202947_12_ITEM8_P48_S1	All required notices were made to RIDEM.
202947_12_ITEM8_P48_S2	In 2000, the tank was demolished and testing of the groundwater indicated that there was no large pooling of contaminants.
202947_12_ITEM8_P49_S0	In 2001, RIDEM approved a plan pursuant to which the Company installed a passive system consisting of three wells and commenced monitoring the wells.
202947_12_ITEM8_P49_S1	In 2003, RIDEM decided that the passive monitoring system previously approved was not sufficient and required the Company to design an active remediation system for the removal of product from the contaminated site.
202947_12_ITEM8_P49_S2	The Company and its consulting engineers began the pre-design testing of the site in the fourth quarter of 2004.
202947_12_ITEM8_P49_S3	The consulting engineers estimated a total cost of $200,000 to design, install and operate the system, which amount was accrued in 2004.
202947_12_ITEM8_P49_S4	Through 2006, the Company had expended $119,000 and has not incurred any additional costs since then.
202947_12_ITEM8_P49_S5	In 2011, RIDEM notified the company to proceed with the next phase of the approval process, notifying the abutters of the proposed remediation system even though RIDEM has not yet taken any action on the Company s proposed plan.
202947_12_ITEM8_P50_S0	As designed, the system will pump out the contaminants which will be disposed of in compliance with applicable regulations.
202947_12_ITEM8_P50_S1	After a period of time, the groundwater will be tested to determine if sufficient contaminants have been removed.
202947_12_ITEM8_P50_S2	While the Company and its consulting engineers believe that the proposed active remediation system will correct the situation, it is possible that RIDEM could require the Company to expand remediation efforts, which could result in the Company incurring costs in excess of the remaining accrual of $81,000.
202947_12_ITEM8_P51_S0	The Pier is a deep-water pier in East Providence, Rhode Island owned by the Company which is integral to the operation of the Terminal.
202947_12_ITEM8_P51_S1	The Pier and the Terminal are connected by two petroleum pipelines which the Company has a permanent right to use.
202947_12_ITEM8_P52_S0	Income taxes: Income tax expense is comprised of the following components:
202947_12_ITEM8_P53_S0	The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2010 did not bear the customary relationship between income tax expense and pretax accounting income due to the Company s generation of a federal historic tax credit, resulting in an effective tax rate of 21 percent.
202947_12_ITEM8_P54_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, a reconciliation of the income tax provision as computed by applying the United States income tax rate (34%) to income before income taxes is as follows: Deferred income taxes are recorded based upon differences between financial statement and tax basis amounts of assets and liabilities.
202947_12_ITEM8_P54_S1	The tax effects of temporary differences which give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows: The Company s federal and various state income tax returns for the years subsequent to 2007 remain subject to examination.
202947_12_ITEM8_P54_S2	The Company follows United States generally accepted accounting principles when reviewing all its tax positions and has determined that no reserves are required.
202947_12_ITEM8_P55_S0	In November 2008, the Company restated its Articles of Incorporation:
202947_12_ITEM8_P56_S0	To provide for certain transfer and ownership restrictions as set forth therein.
202947_12_ITEM8_P57_S0	In December 2008, the Company issued (in the form of a stock dividend) 3,299,956 shares of Class B Common Stock on a one-for-one basis for each share of Class A Common Stock held.
202947_12_ITEM8_P57_S1	The holders of Class A and Class B Common Stock vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to the shareholders of the Company except for the election of the Board of Directors and except in connection with certain major corporate actions, including a sale of the Company.
202947_12_ITEM8_P57_S2	The holders of Class A Common Stock, voting as a separate class, elect one-third of the Board of Directors.
202947_12_ITEM8_P57_S3	The holders of Class B Common Stock, voting as a separate class, elect the remainder of the Board of Directors.
202947_12_ITEM8_P58_S0	Class B Common Stock is convertible by the record owner thereof into the same number of shares of Class A Common Stock at any time.
202947_12_ITEM8_P58_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the number of shares converted were 16,318 shares and 74,860 shares, respectively.
202947_12_ITEM8_P59_S0	The Class A Common Stock is listed on the Premier QX Tier of the OTCQX.
202947_12_ITEM8_P59_S1	The Class B Common Stock is not listed on any national or regional stock exchange, or on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation National Market System or on the OTCQX.
202947_12_ITEM8_P60_S0	The holders of Class A and Class B Common Stock share equally in the earnings of the Company and in dividends declared by the Company.
202947_12_ITEM8_P60_S1	The Company s Restated Articles of Incorporation prohibits any shareholder from acquiring more than a 5% interest in the Company s classes of common stock and prohibits any shareholder or any beneficial owner who, at the time of the filing of the Restated Articles of Incorporation owned 5% or more of the Company s classes of common stock from increasing their aggregate percentage ownership of both classes of common stock.
202947_12_ITEM8_P60_S2	Should a shareholder acquire a number of shares that results in the limitation being exceeded, shares in excess of the limitation would be automatically converted into an equal number of shares of Excess Stock, which class was authorized pursuant to the 2001 Amendment to the Company s Articles of Incorporation.
202947_12_ITEM8_P60_S3	Excess Stock is non-voting and is not entitled to dividends.
202947_12_ITEM8_P60_S4	However, the shareholder may designate a qualifying transferee for shares of Excess Stock, at which time such shares would be converted and reissued as Class A or Class B Common shares as the case may be.
202947_12_ITEM8_P61_S0	The purpose for creating the Class B Common Stock was to put the Company in the position to qualify to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ).
202947_12_ITEM8_P61_S1	One of the qualifications to be taxed as a REIT is that no more than 50% of the shares of a company can be held by five or fewer individuals during the last half of each taxable year.
202947_12_ITEM8_P61_S2	Currently, the majority shareholder controls 52.3% of the Company s outstanding common stock and three other shareholders each own more than 5% of the Company s outstanding common stock.
202947_12_ITEM8_P61_S3	In order for the Company to qualify to be taxed as a REIT, the major shareholders ownership of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock would need to be reduced below the 50% level.
202947_12_ITEM8_P62_S0	Operating segment disclosures: The Company operates in two segments: (1) Leasing and (2) Petroleum Storage.
202947_12_ITEM8_P62_S1	The Company makes decisions relative to the allocation of resources and evaluates performance based on each segment s respective income before income taxes, excluding interest expense and certain corporate expenses.
202947_12_ITEM8_P62_S2	Inter-segment revenues are immaterial in amount.
202947_12_ITEM8_P62_S3	The following financial information is used for making operating decisions and assessing performance of the Company s segments:
202947_12_ITEM8_P63_S0	The following is a reconciliation of the segment information to the amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements:
202947_12_ITEM8_P64_S0	The following table sets forth those customers whose revenues exceed 10% of the Company s segment revenues:
202947_12_ITEM8_P65_S0	Related party transaction: The Company and Providence and Worcester Railroad Company ( the Railroad ) have a common controlling shareholder.
202947_12_ITEM8_P66_S0	The Company has the right to use certain pipelines located in the right of way of the Railroad which were constructed by Getty Oil Company (Eastern Operations), Inc. ( GettyEO ).
202947_12_ITEM8_P66_S1	Pursuant to an agreement between the Railroad and GettyEO dated August 6, 1975, the Railroad has the right to relocate any portion of the pipelines located within the Railroad s right of way.
202947_12_ITEM8_P66_S2	The Company has supported an extension of Waterfront Drive, so-called, up to Dexter Road and adjacent to the Company s Terminal, which road is being constructed on the Railroad right of way.
202947_12_ITEM8_P66_S3	The State of Rhode Island s plans for the Waterfront Drive extension required a relocation of a portion of the pipelines which the Railroad has the right to relocate.
202947_12_ITEM8_P66_S4	RIDOT entered into an agreement with the Railroad (the RIDOT Agreement ) to reimburse the Railroad for reasonable costs incurred by it in relocating the pipelines, which were originally estimated to be $159,000.
202947_12_ITEM8_P66_S5	Any substantial change to the estimate requires the approval of RIDOT.
202947_12_ITEM8_P67_S0	In May 2011, the Company entered into an agreement with the Railroad to act as the Railroad s agent with respect to the relocation of the pipelines.
202947_12_ITEM8_P67_S1	The Company, without receiving compensation, is obligated under the agreement to select, direct and supervise all subcontractors subject to the Railroad s approval.
202947_12_ITEM8_P68_S0	Upon the Railroad s receipt of invoices from the contractors, the Railroad requires the Company to verify the accuracy of the invoices and submit a check to the Railroad covering the amount of the invoices.
202947_12_ITEM8_P68_S1	The Railroad pays the invoices, using the funds advanced by the Company.
202947_12_ITEM8_P68_S2	The Railroad is then obligated to submit the invoices to RIDOT for reimbursement.
202947_12_ITEM8_P68_S3	Any reimbursements received from RIDOT are required to be paid to the Company in a timely manner.
202947_12_ITEM8_P68_S4	Any shortfall in RIDOT s reimbursement is borne by the Company.
202947_12_ITEM8_P68_S5	At December 31, 2011, costs incurred to relocate the pipeline totaled $219,000, which amount is included in prepaid and other on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2011.
202947_12_ITEM8_P68_S6	Of this amount, the Company had made a cash advance of $119,000 to the Railroad by December 31, 2011.
202947_12_ITEM8_P68_S7	The Railroad submitted the total amount to RIDOT in February 2012 and has not yet received any reimbursements.
202947_12_ITEM8_P68_S8	The Railroad and the Company have discussed with RIDOT the $60,000 in excess costs incurred to complete the project but no acceptance by RIDOT has yet been made.
202947_12_ITEM8_P68_S9	The Company believes, based on its discussions with RIDOT, that reimbursement to the Railroad and ultimately the Company, is reasonably assured.
202947_12_ITEM8_P69_S0	At September 30, 2011, the Company had recorded a liability in connection with the pipeline rupture as discussed in Note 6.
202947_12_ITEM8_P69_S1	During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company was paid $89,000, which amount was offset against the previously recorded liability and expense by that amount.
202947_12_ITEM8_P69_S2	At December 31, 2011, the Company determined that $184,000 of the remaining liability was assumed by a third party, and the Company reduced the previously recorded liability and expense by that amount.
202947_12_ITEM8_P70_S0	At September 30, 2011, the Company had recorded a liability of $132,000 in connection with the USLD incident as discussed in Note 6.
202947_12_ITEM8_P70_S1	At December 31, 2011, the Company determined that its insurance carrier had assumed this liability, and the Company reduced the previously recorded liability and expense by that amount.
202947_12_ITEM9_P0_S0	financial disclosure as defined by Item 304 of Regulation S-K. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Under the supervision of the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report.
202947_12_ITEM9_P0_S1	Based upon this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of such date, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in making them aware on a timely basis of the material information relating to the Company required to be included in the Company s periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
202947_12_ITEM9_P1_S0	The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act).
202947_12_ITEM9_P1_S1	The Company s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of its financial reporting and the preparation of published financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
202947_12_ITEM9_P1_S2	However, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
202947_12_ITEM9_P1_S3	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
202947_12_ITEM9_P1_S4	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies may deteriorate.
202947_12_ITEM9_P2_S0	Management conducted its evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) as of December 31, 2011.
202947_12_ITEM9_P2_S1	Based on this assessment, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer believe that as of December 31, 2011, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on criteria set forth by COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.
202947_12_ITEM9_P2_S2	This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
202947_12_ITEM9_P2_S3	Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report.
202947_12_ITEM9_P3_S0	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the quarter ended December 31, 2011, there has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

202947_12_ITEM12_P2_S0	The Company has the right to use certain pipelines located in the Railroad s right of way which were constructed by Getty Oil Company (Eastern Operations), Inc. ( GettyEO ).
202947_12_ITEM12_P2_S1	Pursuant to an agreement between the Railroad and GettyEO dated August 6, 1975, the Railroad has the right to relocate any portion of the pipelines located within the Railroad s right of way.
202947_12_ITEM12_P2_S2	The Company has supported an extension of Waterfront Drive, so-called, up to Dexter Road and adjacent to the Company s Terminal, which road is being constructed on the Railroad right of way.
202947_12_ITEM12_P2_S3	The State of Rhode Island s plans for the Waterfront Drive extension required a relocation of a portion of the pipelines which the Railroad has the right to relocate.
202947_12_ITEM12_P2_S4	RIDOT entered into an agreement with the Railroad (the RIDOT Agreement ) to reimburse the Railroad for reasonable costs incurred by it in relocating the pipelines, which were originally estimated to be $159,000.
202947_12_ITEM12_P2_S5	Any substantial change to the estimate requires the approval of RIDOT.
202947_12_ITEM12_P3_S0	In May 2011, the Company entered into an agreement with the Railroad to act as the Railroad s agent with respect to the relocation of the pipelines.
202947_12_ITEM12_P3_S1	The Company, without receiving compensation, is obligated under the agreement to select, direct and supervise all subcontractors subject to the Railroad s approval.
202947_12_ITEM12_P4_S0	Upon the Railroad s receipt of invoices from the contractors, the Railroad requires the Company to verify the accuracy of the invoices and submit a check to the Railroad covering the amount of the invoices.
202947_12_ITEM12_P4_S1	The Railroad pays the invoices, using the funds advanced by the Company.
202947_12_ITEM12_P4_S2	The Railroad is then obligated to submit the invoices to RIDOT for reimbursement.
202947_12_ITEM12_P4_S3	Any reimbursements received from RIDOT are required to be paid to the Company in a timely manner.
202947_12_ITEM12_P4_S4	Any shortfall in RIDOT s reimbursement is borne by the Company.
202947_12_ITEM12_P5_S0	At December 31, 2011, costs incurred to relocate the pipeline totaled $219,000.
202947_12_ITEM12_P5_S1	Of this amount, the Company had made a cash advance of $119,000 to the Railroad by December 31, 2011.
202947_12_ITEM12_P5_S2	The Railroad submitted the total amount to RIDOT in February 2012 and has not yet received any reimbursements.
202947_12_ITEM12_P5_S3	The Railroad and the Company have discussed with RIDOT the $60,000 in excess costs incurred to complete the project but no acceptance by RIDOT has yet been made.
202947_12_ITEM12_P5_S4	The Company believes, based on its discussions with RIDOT, that reimbursement to the Railroad and ultimately the Company, is reasonably assured.

202947_12_ITEM15_P18_S0	(2) The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
202947_13_ITEM1_P0_S0	2012, in January 2013, the Board of Directors voted to omit the regular quarterly dividend of $0.03 per share.
202947_13_ITEM1_P0_S1	The Board will review the declaration of future dividends on a quarterly basis.
202947_13_ITEM1_P0_S2	The declaration of future dividends will depend on future earnings, financial performance, including whether Global ultimately elects to purchase the Facility and, if not, the Company s success, or lack thereof, in marketing the Terminal for short-term storage and distribution of heating oil and ULSD.
202947_13_ITEM1_P0_S3	Should the Facility become idle, monthly cash outlays to maintain the Facility will be approximately $80,000.
202947_13_ITEM1_P0_S4	The Company expects that cash generated from current operations will continue to be sufficient to meet operating expenses, debt service and ordinary capital expenditures.
202947_13_ITEM1_P0_S5	At December 31, 2012, the Company has no non-cancellable contract obligations other than two operating leases for billboard locations for which the rent expense is not material in amount.
202947_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	owns approximately 18.5 acres and a historic building in and adjacent to the Capital Center District in Providence, Rhode Island.
202947_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	All of the property and a portion of the building are leased either under long-term leases or short-term leases as more particularly described in Item 1, Leasing Segment.
202947_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	The Company also owns or controls 24 locations on which billboards have been constructed.
202947_13_ITEM2_P1_S1	Of these, 22 are owned by the Company under permanent easements from a related company, the Railroad, and two are leased from unrelated third parties with remaining terms of five years or less.
202947_13_ITEM2_P2_S0	The Company owns an approximate 10-acre site in East Providence, Rhode Island on which there are located nine petroleum storage tanks and related distribution racks together with a 3,000 square foot single-story office building which houses the Company s headquarters and other support operations.
202947_13_ITEM2_P2_S1	In 2006, the Company completed the development of the land currently owned by the Company at the Terminal.
202947_13_ITEM2_P2_S2	In addition, the Company is the owner of the Pier located in East Providence, Rhode Island.
202947_13_ITEM2_P2_S3	The Pier, which has a deep water draft capacity of -40 feet MLW, can accommodate ships up to eight hundred feet in length.
202947_13_ITEM2_P2_S4	The Company has a permanent right to use the pipelines connecting the Pier to the Terminal.
202947_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	during the quarterly periods indicated as obtained from the OTCQX, together with cash dividends paid per share during such periods.
202947_13_ITEM5_P0_S1	In connection with the extraordinary dividend declared in December 2012 ($2.25 per common share), $.45 per share was paid in cash and $1.80 per share was paid in Dividend Notes due December 26, 2022, bearing interest at the annual rate of 5% payable semi-annually.
202947_13_ITEM5_P0_S2	Shareholders owning less than 100 shares of any class of Company stock, where the shares were titled in their names and not held by a broker, received 100% of the dividend in cash unless they elected to receive it 20% in cash and 80% in Dividend Notes.
202947_13_ITEM5_P0_S3	Given the extraordinary dividend declared and paid in late December 2012, at its January 2013 meeting, the Board of Directors voted to omit the regular quarterly dividend of $.03 per share but agreed to consider the payment of future dividends on a quarterly basis.
202947_13_ITEM5_P1_S0	Information with respect to the high and low trading prices for the Class B Common Stock is not available because the stock is not listed on any exchange, is not quoted by any quotation service, and there is no known market for such Class B Common Stock.
202947_13_ITEM5_P1_S1	At February 28, 2013, there were 586 holders of record of the Company s Class A Common Stock and 528 holders of record of the Company s Class B Common Stock.
202947_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	Critical accounting policies: The Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) has issued guidance for the disclosure of critical accounting policies.
202947_13_ITEM7_P0_S1	The SEC defines such policies as those that require application of management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.
202947_13_ITEM7_P0_S2	The Company s significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
202947_13_ITEM7_P0_S3	Not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates.
202947_13_ITEM7_P0_S4	Management believes that the Company s revenue recognition policy for long-term leases with scheduled rent increases (leasing segment) meets the SEC definition of critical.
202947_13_ITEM7_P0_S5	Certain of the Company s long-term land leases have original terms of 30 to 149 years and contain scheduled rent increases where the future dollar increases are known at the time of the commencement of the lease or at a subsequent date.
202947_13_ITEM7_P0_S6	The first such lease commenced in 1988, had an original term of 99 years and provides for fixed percentage increases at specified intervals (as well as reappraisal increases).
202947_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	In accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) in accounting for leases, rental income related to the fixed percentage increases that are presently known should be recognized on a straight-line basis.
202947_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	To calculate the annual straight-line amount, the 99 known annual rental amounts are totaled and this total is divided by 99.
202947_13_ITEM7_P1_S2	In 2009, a scheduled appraisal occurred, resulting in a rental increase.
202947_13_ITEM7_P1_S3	The Company recalculated the future annual straight-line amount using the remaining years under the lease.
202947_13_ITEM7_P1_S4	The turnaround date discussed below did not change.
202947_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	For this lease, the calculated annual straight-line amount for 1988 was eight times (multiple) the amount paid by the tenant under the terms of the lease (the contractual amount ).
202947_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	In subsequent years, as the tenant pays higher rents, the multiple gradually decreases until the 57 th year of the lease, at which time the contractual amount paid by the tenant will exceed the calculated straight-line amount.
202947_13_ITEM7_P2_S2	If the Company were to report annual revenue for this lease using the straight-line amount, it would record a significant receivable for each of the first 56 years, which receivable would grow to approximately $34,000,000.
202947_13_ITEM7_P2_S3	Management does not believe that the Company should record a receivable that would not begin to be collected until the 56 th year (the turnaround date ) since management could not be assured of collection.
202947_13_ITEM7_P2_S4	In 1988, management met with the SEC accounting staff to discuss its concerns in applying GAAP as it related to a lease of this length which results in the recording of such a significant receivable that would remain on the Company s balance sheet and continue to grow on an annual basis with a turnaround date so far in the future.
202947_13_ITEM7_P2_S5	The Company presented the SEC accounting staff with an application of the accounting policy whereby management would evaluate the collectability of the receivable on an annual basis and report as leasing revenue only that portion of the receivable that management could presently conclude would be collectible.
202947_13_ITEM7_P2_S6	The SEC accounting staff did not object to this application by the Company.
202947_13_ITEM7_P2_S7	Through December 31, 2012, the receivable on this lease has grown to $20,728,000 (cumulative excess of straight-line over contractual rentals) and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround date is still 33 years away.
202947_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	In 2004, a second such lease commenced with an original term of 149 years and provides for fixed minimum percentage increases at specified intervals (as well as reappraisal increases).
202947_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	For this lease, the contractual amount paid by the tenant will not exceed the calculated straight-line amount until the 94 th year of the lease.
202947_13_ITEM7_P3_S2	Through December 31, 2012, the receivable on this lease is $20,310,000 (cumulative excess of straight-line over contractual rentals) and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround date is 85 years away.
202947_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	In 2006, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Agreement of its lease with Lamar Outdoor Advertising LLC ( Lamar ) with a current remaining term of 21 years which provides for fixed percentage increases annually.
202947_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	For this lease, the contractual amount paid by Lamar will not exceed the calculated straight-line amount until the 16 th year of the lease.
202947_13_ITEM7_P4_S2	Through December 31, 2012, the receivable on this lease is $1,368,000 (cumulative excess of straight-line over contractual rentals) and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround date is nine years away.
202947_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	Accordingly, the Company has not reported any portion of these amounts as leasing revenue in its consolidated financial statements and does not anticipate that it can reach such a conclusion until the turnaround dates are closer.
202947_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	Although the Company s other long-term land leases provide for scheduled rent increases, the provisions of the leases are such that certain future dollar amounts could not be calculated either at the time of the commencement of the lease or now, as such amounts are based on factors that are not presently known, i.e., future cost-of-living adjustments or future appraised values.
202947_13_ITEM7_P5_S2	Through December 31, 2012, the receivable on these leases is $11,239,000 and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround dates are approximately 48 years away.
202947_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	Segments: The Company operates in two segments: leasing and petroleum storage.
202947_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	The leasing segment consists of the long-term leasing of certain of its real estate interests in downtown Providence, Rhode Island (upon the commencement of which the tenants have been required to construct buildings thereon, with the exception of the parking garage and Parcels 6B and 6C), the leasing of a portion of the Steeple Street Building under short-term leasing arrangements and the leasing of locations along interstate and primary highways in Rhode Island and Massachusetts to Lamar which has constructed outdoor advertising boards thereon.
202947_13_ITEM7_P6_S2	The Company anticipates that the future development of its remaining properties in and adjacent to the Capital Center area will consist primarily of long-term ground leases.
202947_13_ITEM7_P6_S3	Pending this development, the Company leases these parcels for public parking under short-term leasing arrangements to Metropark.
202947_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	The petroleum storage segment consists of operating the Facility in East Providence, Rhode Island, for Global Companies, LLC ( Global ).
202947_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	The principal difference between the two segments relates to the nature of the operations.
202947_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	In the leasing segment, the tenants under the long-term land leases incur substantially all of the development and operating costs of the assets constructed on the Company s land, including the payment of real property taxes on both the land and any improvements constructed thereon; whereas the Company is responsible for the operating and maintenance expenditures, including insurance and a portion of the real property taxes, as well as certain capital improvements at the Facility.
202947_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	Results of operations: Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2011 Leasing segment: Leasing revenues increased due to scheduled increases in rentals under long-term land leases.
202947_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	Leasing expense remained at the 2011 level.
202947_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	In June 2011, Global reimbursed the Company $458,000 for certain costs associated with the cleanup, inspection and repair of a tank (which costs were recorded in 2010) and an additional $53,000 for tank repairs.
202947_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	Exclusive of these amounts, petroleum storage facility revenues increased $104,000 due to scheduled annual cost-of-living adjustments under the lease for the petroleum storage facility.
202947_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	In connection with a pipeline breach in August 2011 by Cardi Corporation ( Cardi ), at September 30, 2011, management estimated that the total cost incurred by the Company in responding to the emergency and repairing the pipeline was $349,000, which amount was accrued as an expense.
202947_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	In November 2011, Cardi paid the Company $89,000, which amount was offset against the expense previously recorded.
202947_13_ITEM7_P11_S2	During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company paid an additional $14,000 in connection with the pipeline rupture.
202947_13_ITEM7_P11_S3	At December 31, 2011, the Company determined that $184,000 of the remaining liability was assumed by Cardi.
202947_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	recorded liability and expense by that amount.
202947_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	In February 2012, Cardi paid the $184,000.
202947_13_ITEM7_P12_S2	In May 2012, Cardi paid both the remaining $76,000 and the $14,000, and the Company reduced the accrued liability and recorded the $90,000 as a reduction of expense.
202947_13_ITEM7_P12_S3	Exclusive of the $90,000, petroleum storage facility expense remained approximately at the 2011 level.
202947_13_ITEM7_P12_S4	However, increases in payroll and related costs and professional fees in connection with the Global Option Agreement (see Note 6 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements herein) were offset in part by lower levels of repair and maintenance costs.
202947_13_ITEM7_P12_S5	General: For the year ended December 31, 2012, general and administrative expense increased $249,000 from 2011 due principally to costs associated with the extraordinary dividend and consulting fees incurred in connection with marketing the Facility.
202947_13_ITEM7_P12_S6	Interest expense: In April 2010, the Company borrowed $6,000,000 from a bank.
202947_13_ITEM7_P12_S7	The loan bore interest at an annual rate of 6% and had a term of ten years with repayments on a 20-year amortization schedule (monthly principal payments of $25,000 plus interest) and a balloon payment due in April 2020 when the loan was due to mature.
202947_13_ITEM7_P12_S8	In 2012 and 2011, the Company made principal prepayments totaling $1,000,000 and $1,525,000, respectively.
202947_13_ITEM7_P12_S9	For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, interest expense was $207,000 and $315,000, respectively.
202947_13_ITEM7_P12_S10	Interest expense was lower due to decreased debt levels prior to the refinancing of the bank loan and the issuance of dividend notes in late December 2012.
202947_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	Income taxes: The Company s effective income tax rate for 2012 is approximately 39%.
202947_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	Liquidity and capital resources: As a result of the issuance of dividend notes and the refinancing of the bank loan in late December 2012, the Company s financial position has changed significantly.
202947_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	In December 2012, the Company and the Bank entered into an Amended and Restated Loan Agreement pursuant to which the Company refinanced the $2,700,000 balance of the 2010 debt to the Bank (described in Interest Expense above) and borrowed an additional $3,025,000, which was used to pay part of an extraordinary dividend of $2.25 per share to shareholders.
202947_13_ITEM7_P14_S2	The existing note to the Bank was amended and now bears interest at an annual rate of 3.34% for the first five years and thereafter will bear interest on either a floating rate basis at LIBOR plus 215 basis points with a floor of 3.25% or a fixed rate of 225 basis points over the five-year Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston Classic Advance Rate.
202947_13_ITEM7_P14_S3	The loan has a term of ten years with repayments on a 20-year amortization schedule (monthly payments of $24,000 plus interest) and a balloon payment of $2,869,000 in December 2022 when the loan matures.
202947_13_ITEM7_P14_S4	The note further contains the customary covenants, terms and conditions, and permits prepayment, in whole or in part, at any time without penalty if the prepayment is made from internally generated funds.
202947_13_ITEM7_P14_S5	Parcels 3S and 5 in the Capital Center continue to serve as collateral for the loan.
202947_13_ITEM7_P14_S6	Despite the $3,025,000 increase in the bank loan, the principal and interest payments on an annual basis remain approximately the same due to a reduction in the interest rate.
202947_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	Dividend notes: On December 7, 2012, the Board of Directors of the Company declared an extraordinary dividend of $2.25 per share on its Class A and Class B common stock to shareholders of record on December 17, 2012.
202947_13_ITEM7_P15_S1	On December 27, 2012, the Company paid out $3,063,000 in cash and issued $11,787,000 in principal face amount of 5% dividend notes due December 26, 2022 (the Dividend Notes ).
202947_13_ITEM7_P15_S2	The Dividend Notes are unsecured general obligations of the Company bearing interest at the annual rate of 5% payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 to note holders of record on June 1 and December 1 of each year.
202947_13_ITEM7_P15_S3	The Dividend Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time and from time to time at the option of the Company.
202947_13_ITEM7_P15_S4	The Dividend Notes are subject to mandatory redemption in an amount equal to the Net Proceeds from the sale of any real property owned by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
202947_13_ITEM7_P15_S5	Net Proceeds means the gross cash received by the Company from any such sale reduced by the sum of (a) costs relating to the sale, (b) federal and state income taxes as a result of the sale, and (c) the amount used by the Company to pay in whole or in part financial institution debts secured by a mortgage of the Company s or any subsidiary s real property regardless of whether such mortgage encumbers the property sold.
202947_13_ITEM7_P15_S6	The Company has obligated itself not to grant any mortgages on any of its property located in the Capitol Center District in Providence, Rhode Island, other than Parcels 3S and 5, and to cause its subsidiaries not to grant any such mortgages, in each case without the consent of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding principal face amount of the Dividend Notes.
202947_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	The Dividend Notes contain other customary terms and conditions.
202947_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	The interest payments on an annual basis total $590,000.
202947_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	Exercise of purchase option by Global: Since 1998, the Company and Global have been parties to a lease agreement whereby the Company operates the entire Facility for Global.
202947_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	The Company is responsible for labor, insurance, a portion of the real property taxes and other operating expenses, as well as certain capital improvements.
202947_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	Under the terms of the Option Agreement between the Company and Global dated June 9, 2003 (the Option Agreement ), on April 27, 2012, Global preliminarily exercised its option to purchase the Company s Facility.
202947_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	In compliance with the Option Agreement, the Company thereafter provided Global with a calculation of Adjusted Book Value (as that term is defined in the Option Agreement) of the Facility, which amounted to $19,700,000.
202947_13_ITEM7_P19_S2	Global then elected to proceed with the determination of Appraised Value (as defined in the Option Agreement).
202947_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	Global and the Company each selected an appraiser.
202947_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	Global and the Company elected to defer selection of a third appraiser until their respective appraisers completed their appraisals and discussed the results.
202947_13_ITEM7_P20_S2	The Company s appraiser arrived at an appraised value of $46,200,000 for the Facility.
202947_13_ITEM7_P20_S3	Global s appraiser arrived at a value of $15,400,000 for the Facility.
202947_13_ITEM7_P20_S4	As required by the Option Agreement, the two appraisers then engaged a third appraiser whose appraisal is expected to be completed on or before March 31, 2013.
202947_13_ITEM7_P20_S5	Absent agreement amongst the three appraisers, the Appraised Value will be the average of the two appraisals that are closest to one another.
202947_13_ITEM7_P20_S6	Upon the determination of the Appraised Value, Global has the right to either rescind the notice of preliminary exercise or elect to commence a feasibility study and inspection period.
202947_13_ITEM7_P20_S7	At any time during the 180-day period of the feasibility study and inspection, Global may elect to rescind its notice of preliminary exercise.
202947_13_ITEM7_P20_S8	If Global fails to do so, then the exercise becomes final subject to the usual and customary closing conditions and the parties have not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days to close the transaction.
202947_13_ITEM7_P20_S9	However, the Company may, at its sole discretion, delay the closing for a period not to exceed twelve months.
202947_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	Under the Option Agreement, if Global elects to proceed with the purchase, it must pay the greater of (a) the Adjusted Book Value or (b) the Appraised Value.
202947_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	On May 1, 2012, the Company gave Global notice of non-extension of the Global lease.
202947_13_ITEM7_P21_S2	Accordingly, the Global lease will expire on April 30, 2013.
202947_13_ITEM7_P21_S3	Global is solely responsible for the removal of its inventory and the cleaning of the tanks prior to May 1, 2013 and the costs associated with these activities.
202947_13_ITEM7_P21_S4	Management has prepared, and the Board has approved, a marketing plan for the Facility.
202947_13_ITEM7_P21_S5	Pursuant to the plan, the Company is marketing the Facility for lease to multiple users for temporary storage and distribution of heating oil and Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel ( ULSD ).
202947_13_ITEM7_P21_S6	Management cannot presently determine when such future arrangements will commence and the financial terms thereof.
202947_13_ITEM7_P21_S7	During 2012, the Company s operating activities provided an additional $2,680,000 of cash which was approximately $400,000 less than the cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2011.
202947_13_ITEM7_P21_S8	The principal reason for the difference was the overpayment of income taxes in 2011 which reduced tax payments in 2011, offset in part by a reduction in outstanding accounts payable at December 31, 2011.
202947_13_ITEM7_P21_S9	Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2012 increased $500,000 from the 2011 level; in 2012, the Company s expenditures for properties and equipment were $400,000 lower than in 2011.
202947_13_ITEM7_P21_S10	In 2012, the Company made cash payments of $3,855,000 for dividends and $1,300,000 in principal payments on the note payable to the Bank (including $1,000,000 in a prepayment).
202947_13_ITEM7_P21_S11	Historically, the Company has had adequate liquidity to fund its operations.
202947_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	Cash and cash commitments: At December 31, 2012, the Company had cash of $2,678,000.
202947_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	The Company maintains all of its cash in non-interest bearing checking accounts in one bank which were fully insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ).
202947_13_ITEM7_P22_S2	Effective January 1, 2013, the FDIC reduced the insurance on all non-interest bearing bank accounts to a maximum of $250,000.
202947_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	In connection with the December 2012 Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, the Company is required to maintain unencumbered liquid assets (cash and marketable securities) of $1,000,000 at the Bank.
202947_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	The current economic conditions have had limited impact on the Company s results of operations to date.
202947_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	As none of the Company s leases require the tenant to provide financial information, the Company has no information concerning the impact of current economic conditions on its major tenants.
202947_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	Under the terms of the Company s long-term land leases, appraisals of the premises are periodically required at various stated intervals to provide the basis for recalculating the annual rent.
202947_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	However, if as a result of such appraisal the annual rent is calculated to be less than the then current rent, the annual rent will remain at the current level.
202947_13_ITEM7_P25_S2	An appraisal of Parcel 5 has been undertaken to determine what amount, if any, the annual rent will be increased April 1, 2013.
202947_13_ITEM7_P25_S3	The current annual rent is $344,000.
202947_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	At December 31, 2012, the Company has three tenants in a portion of the Steeple Street Building under short-term leases (five years or less) at a current annual rental of $119,000.
202947_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	The Company is currently marketing the remaining portions of the building for lease.
202947_13_ITEM7_P26_S2	Under the Company s lease with Global, the annual cost-of-living adjustment was $99,000 effective May 1, 2012.
202947_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	From time to time, unanticipated events at the Company s Terminal can result in short-term cash requirements.
202947_13_ITEM8_P0_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors Capital Properties, Inc.
202947_13_ITEM8_P0_S1	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Capital Properties, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for the years then ended.
202947_13_ITEM8_P0_S2	These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
202947_13_ITEM8_P0_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
202947_13_ITEM8_P0_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
202947_13_ITEM8_P0_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement.
202947_13_ITEM8_P0_S6	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
202947_13_ITEM8_P0_S7	An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
202947_13_ITEM8_P0_S8	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
202947_13_ITEM8_P1_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
202947_13_ITEM8_P1_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
202947_13_ITEM8_P1_S2	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Capital Properties, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.
202947_13_ITEM8_P2_S0	See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.
202947_13_ITEM8_P3_S0	See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.
202947_13_ITEM8_P4_S0	See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.
202947_13_ITEM8_P5_S0	See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.
202947_13_ITEM8_P6_S0	Description of business: Capital Properties, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Tri-State Displays, Inc., Capital Terminal Company and Dunellen, LLC (collectively referred to as the Company ) operate in two segments, leasing and petroleum storage.
202947_13_ITEM8_P7_S0	The leasing segment consists of the long-term leasing of certain of its real estate interests in downtown Providence, Rhode Island (upon the commencement of which the tenants are required to construct buildings thereon, with the exception of the parking garage and Parcels 6B and 6C), the leasing of a portion of its building ( Steeple Street Building ) under short-term leasing arrangements and the leasing of locations along interstate and primary highways in Rhode Island and Massachusetts to Lamar Outdoor Advertising, LLC ( Lamar ) which has constructed outdoor advertising boards thereon.
202947_13_ITEM8_P7_S1	The Company anticipates that the future development of its remaining properties in and adjacent to the Capital Center area will consist primarily of long-term ground leases.
202947_13_ITEM8_P7_S2	Pending this development, the Company leases these parcels for public parking under short-term leasing arrangements to Metropark, Ltd. ( Metropark ).
202947_13_ITEM8_P8_S0	The petroleum storage segment consists of operating the petroleum storage terminal (the Terminal ) and the Wilkesbarre Pier (the Pier ), both of which are owned by the Company and are collectively referred to as the Facility, located in East Providence, Rhode Island, for Global Companies, LLC ( Global ) which stores and distributes petroleum products.
202947_13_ITEM8_P8_S1	The principal difference between the two segments relates to the nature of the operations.
202947_13_ITEM8_P9_S0	In the leasing segment, the tenants under long-term land leases incur substantially all of the development and operating costs of the assets constructed on the Company s land, including the payment of real property taxes on both the land and any improvements constructed thereon.
202947_13_ITEM8_P9_S1	In the petroleum storage segment, the Company is responsible for the operating and maintenance expenditures, including insurance and a portion of the real property taxes, as well as certain capital improvements at the Facility.
202947_13_ITEM8_P10_S0	Principles of consolidation: The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts and transactions of the Company and its subsidiaries.
202947_13_ITEM8_P10_S1	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
202947_13_ITEM8_P11_S0	Use of estimates: The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.
202947_13_ITEM8_P11_S1	Estimates also affect the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.
202947_13_ITEM8_P11_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
202947_13_ITEM8_P12_S0	Fair value of financial instruments: The Company believes that the fair values of its financial instruments, including cash, receivables and payables, approximate their respective book values because of their short-term nature.
202947_13_ITEM8_P12_S1	The fair value of the bank note payable approximates its book value and was determined using borrowing rates currently available to the Company for loans with similar terms and maturities.
202947_13_ITEM8_P12_S2	Based upon an opinion obtained by the Company from an investment banking firm, the fair value of the dividend notes payable approximates their book value.
202947_13_ITEM8_P12_S3	The fair values described herein were determined using significant other observable inputs (Level 2) as defined by GAAP.
202947_13_ITEM8_P13_S0	Properties and equipment: Properties and equipment are stated at cost.
202947_13_ITEM8_P13_S1	Acquisitions and additions are capitalized while routine maintenance and repairs, which do not improve the asset or extend its life, are charged to expense when incurred.
202947_13_ITEM8_P13_S2	Depreciation is being provided by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.
202947_13_ITEM8_P14_S0	The Company follows GAAP when accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, which requires that properties and equipment held and used by the Company be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value of the asset may not be recoverable.
202947_13_ITEM8_P14_S1	An impairment loss will be recognized if the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and before interest) from the use of the asset is less than the net book value of the asset.
202947_13_ITEM8_P14_S2	Generally, the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the estimated fair value of the asset.
202947_13_ITEM8_P15_S0	Cash and cash equivalents: The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
202947_13_ITEM8_P15_S1	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had no cash equivalents.
202947_13_ITEM8_P15_S2	The Company maintains all of its cash in non-interest bearing checking accounts in one bank which were fully insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ).
202947_13_ITEM8_P15_S3	Effective January 1, 2013, the FDIC reduced the insurance on all non-interest bearing bank accounts to a maximum of $250,000.
202947_13_ITEM8_P16_S0	Environmental incidents: The Company accrues a liability when an environmental incident has occurred and the costs are estimable.
202947_13_ITEM8_P16_S1	The Company does not record a receivable for recoveries from third parties for environmental matters until it has determined that the amount of the collection is reasonably assured.
202947_13_ITEM8_P16_S2	The accrued liability is relieved when the Company pays the liability or a third party assumes the liability.
202947_13_ITEM8_P16_S3	Upon determination that collection is reasonably assured or a third party assumes the liability, the Company records the amount as a reduction of expense.
202947_13_ITEM8_P17_S0	The Company charges to expense those costs that do not extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of the property owned or used by the Company.
202947_13_ITEM8_P18_S0	Revenues: Leasing The Company s properties leased to others are under operating leases.
202947_13_ITEM8_P18_S1	The Company reports leasing revenue when earned under the operating method.
202947_13_ITEM8_P18_S2	Certain of the Company s long-term land leases, including the outdoor advertising locations, provide for presently known scheduled rent increases over the remaining terms (21 to 142 years).
202947_13_ITEM8_P18_S3	The Company follows GAAP in accounting for leases by recognizing leasing revenue on the straight-line basis over the terms of the leases; however, the Company does not report as revenue that portion of such straight-line rentals which management is unable to conclude is realizable (collectible) due to the length of the lease terms and other related uncertainties.
202947_13_ITEM8_P19_S0	Petroleum storage facility The Company reports revenue from the operations of the Facility when earned and reports as revenue the tenant s portion of the real property taxes and certain other items as required by the lease.
202947_13_ITEM8_P19_S1	Contingent The Company reports contingent revenue in the period in which the factors occur on which the contingent payments are predicated.
202947_13_ITEM8_P20_S0	Income taxes: The Company and its subsidiaries file consolidated income tax returns.
202947_13_ITEM8_P20_S1	The Company provides for income taxes based on income reported for financial reporting purposes.
202947_13_ITEM8_P20_S2	The provision for income taxes differs from the amounts currently payable because of temporary differences associated with the recognition of certain income and expense items for financial reporting and tax reporting purposes.
202947_13_ITEM8_P20_S3	The Company follows GAAP in accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.
202947_13_ITEM8_P20_S4	Based on its evaluation, the Company has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the consolidated financial statements.
202947_13_ITEM8_P20_S5	The Company will report any tax-related interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.
202947_13_ITEM8_P21_S0	Legal fees: The Company recognizes legal fees as incurred.
202947_13_ITEM8_P22_S0	Basic earnings per common share: Basic earnings per common share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
202947_13_ITEM8_P23_S0	New accounting standards: The Company reviews new accounting standards as issued.
202947_13_ITEM8_P23_S1	Although some of these accounting standards may be applicable to the Company, the Company has not identified any standards that it believes merit further discussion.
202947_13_ITEM8_P23_S2	The Company expects that none of the new standards will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
202947_13_ITEM8_P24_S0	Properties and equipment consist of the following:
202947_13_ITEM8_P25_S0	In April 2010, the Company borrowed $6,000,000 from a bank.
202947_13_ITEM8_P25_S1	The loan bore interest at an annual rate of 6% and had a term of ten years with repayment on a 20-year amortization schedule (monthly principal payments of $25,000 plus interest) and a balloon payment due in April, 2020 when the loan was due to mature.
202947_13_ITEM8_P25_S2	The Note contained customary covenant terms and conditions and permitted repayment in whole or in part at any time without penalty if the prepayment was made from internally generated funds.
202947_13_ITEM8_P25_S3	As collateral for the loan, the Company granted the Bank a mortgage on Parcels 3S and 5 in the Capital Center.
202947_13_ITEM8_P25_S4	The proceeds of the loan were used primarily to fund a special dividend of $5,478,000 to shareholders which represented the Company s earnings and profits as calculated for federal income tax purposes at December 31, 2009.

202947_13_ITEM8_P31_S0	Description of leasing arrangements: Long-term land leases: As of December 31, 2012, the Company had entered into nine long-term land leases, including the Parcel 6A lease discussed below.
202947_13_ITEM8_P31_S1	Of the nine parcels, seven have had improvements constructed thereon.
202947_13_ITEM8_P31_S2	Under the nine land leases, the tenants are required to negotiate any tax stabilization treaty or other arrangements, appeal any changes in real property assessments, and pay real property taxes assessed on land and improvements under these arrangements.
202947_13_ITEM8_P31_S3	Accordingly, real property taxes payable by the tenants are excluded from leasing revenues and leasing expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
202947_13_ITEM8_P31_S4	For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, the real property taxes attributable to the Company s land under these nine leases totaled $1,293,000 and $1,247,000, respectively.
202947_13_ITEM8_P31_S5	Under two of the long-term land leases, the Company receives contingent rentals (based upon a fixed percentage of gross revenue received by the tenants) which totaled $76,000 and $64,000 for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
202947_13_ITEM8_P32_S0	In 2005, a long-term land lease commenced on an undeveloped parcel (Parcel 6) on which two residential buildings were planned.
202947_13_ITEM8_P32_S1	One building containing 96 apartments (120,000 gross square feet) was completed in September 2009.
202947_13_ITEM8_P32_S2	On May 8, 2012, the designee of the holder of the leasehold mortgage on the parcel received title to the premises through a foreclosure deed.
202947_13_ITEM8_P32_S3	On May 18, 2012, the Company entered into three amended and restated leases, each for a portion of the parcel, with single purpose entities formed by the designee of the holder of the leasehold mortgage.

202947_13_ITEM8_P32_S9	In each case, the rent is subject to periodic adjustment.
202947_13_ITEM8_P32_S10	The ground leases are non-recourse to each of the tenants.
202947_13_ITEM8_P32_S11	With respect to the Parcel 6B and 6C leases, an affiliate of the leasehold mortgagee has guaranteed the payment by the tenants of rent and real property taxes as well as certain other tenant monetary obligations for a two-year period which commenced on May 18, 2012.
202947_13_ITEM8_P32_S12	Commencing May 18, 2014, the lessees of the Parcel 6B and 6C leases each has the right to terminate its lease at any time during the remaining term of that lease upon thirty days notice.
202947_13_ITEM8_P33_S0	Under the original Parcel 6 lease which commenced in 2005, the tenant was entitled to a credit for future rents equal to a portion of the real property taxes paid by the tenant through April 2007.
202947_13_ITEM8_P33_S1	In connection with Phase I of the tenant s project, commencing July 1, 2010, the annual rent increased from $48,000 to $300,000.
202947_13_ITEM8_P33_S2	As a result of the rent credit, the tenant was not required to make cash payments for Phase I rent until March 2012 when the rent credit was fully utilized.
202947_13_ITEM8_P34_S0	Commencing July 1, 2010, the Company reclassified each month $25,000 of deferred leasing revenues to leasing revenues.
202947_13_ITEM8_P35_S0	The Company also leases various parcels of land for outdoor advertising purposes to Lamar under a lease having a remaining term of 21 years.
202947_13_ITEM8_P35_S1	The lease provides, among other things, the following: (1) the base rent will increase annually in fixed increases of 2.75% for each leased billboard location commencing June 1, 2006 and on each June 1 thereafter; and (2) in addition to base rent, for each 12-month period commencing each June 1, Lamar must pay to the Company the difference between 30% of the gross revenues from each standard billboard and 20% of the gross revenues from each electronic billboard for such 12-month period reduced by the sum of (a) commissions paid to third parties and (b) the base monthly rent for each leased billboard display for such 12-month period ( contingent revenue ).
202947_13_ITEM8_P35_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, contingent revenues totaled $84,000 and $92,000, respectively.

202947_13_ITEM8_P37_S0	For those leases with presently known scheduled rent increases at December 31, 2012 and 2011, the cumulative excess of straight-line over contractual rentals (considering scheduled rent increases over the 30 to 149 year terms of the leases) and the portion of the excess of straight-line over contractual rentals which management has concluded is realizable when payable over the terms of the leases are as follows:
202947_13_ITEM8_P38_S0	In the event of tenant default, the Company has the right to reclaim its leased land together with any improvements thereon, subject to the right of any leasehold mortgagee to enter into a new lease with the Company with the same terms and conditions as the lease in default.
202947_13_ITEM8_P39_S0	Short-term leases: The Company leases the undeveloped parcels of land in or adjacent to the Capital Center area for public parking purposes to Metropark, Ltd. under a short-term cancellable lease.
202947_13_ITEM8_P39_S1	At December 31, 2012, the Company has three tenants occupying 56% of the Steeple Street Building under short-term leases of five years or less at a current annual rental of $119,000.
202947_13_ITEM8_P39_S2	The Company is recognizing the revenue from these leases on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases.
202947_13_ITEM8_P39_S3	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the excess of straight-line over contractual rentals is $12,000, which is included in prepaid and other on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
202947_13_ITEM8_P39_S4	The Company also reports as revenue from tenants reimbursements for common area costs and real property taxes.
202947_13_ITEM8_P39_S5	The Company is currently marketing the remaining portions of the building for lease.
202947_13_ITEM8_P40_S0	Petroleum storage facility and environmental incidents: Exercise of purchase option by Global: Since 1998, the Company and Global have been parties to a lease agreement whereby the Company operates the entire Facility for Global.
202947_13_ITEM8_P41_S0	The Company is responsible for labor, insurance, a portion of the real property taxes and other operating expenses, as well as certain capital improvements.
202947_13_ITEM8_P42_S0	Under the terms of the Option Agreement between the Company and Global dated June 9, 2003 (the Option Agreement ), on April 27, 2012, Global preliminarily exercised its option to purchase the Company s Facility.
202947_13_ITEM8_P42_S1	In compliance with the Option Agreement, the Company thereafter provided Global with a calculation of Adjusted Book Value (as that term is defined in the Option Agreement) of the Facility which amounted to $19,700,000.
202947_13_ITEM8_P42_S2	Global then elected to proceed with the determination of Appraised Value (as defined in the Option Agreement).
202947_13_ITEM8_P43_S0	Global and the Company each selected an appraiser.
202947_13_ITEM8_P43_S1	Global and the Company elected to defer selection of a third appraiser until their respective appraisers completed their appraisals and discussed the results.
202947_13_ITEM8_P43_S2	The Company s appraiser arrived at an appraised value of $46,200,000 for the Facility.
202947_13_ITEM8_P43_S3	Global s appraiser arrived at a value of $15,400,000 for the Facility.
202947_13_ITEM8_P43_S4	As required by the Option Agreement, the two appraisers then engaged a third appraiser whose appraisal is expected to be completed on or before March 31, 2013.
202947_13_ITEM8_P43_S5	Absent agreement amongst the three appraisers, the Appraised Value will be the average of the two appraisals that are closest to one another.
202947_13_ITEM8_P43_S6	Upon the determination of the Appraised Value, Global has the right to either rescind the notice of preliminary exercise or elect to commence a feasibility study and inspection period.
202947_13_ITEM8_P43_S7	At any time during the 180-day period of the feasibility study and inspection, Global may elect to rescind its notice of preliminary exercise.
202947_13_ITEM8_P43_S8	If Global fails to do so, then the exercise becomes final subject to the usual and customary closing conditions and the parties have not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days to close the transaction.
202947_13_ITEM8_P43_S9	However, the Company may, at its sole discretion, delay the closing for a period not to exceed twelve months.
202947_13_ITEM8_P44_S0	Under the Option Agreement, if Global elects to proceed with the purchase, it must pay the greater of (a) the Adjusted Book Value or (b) the Appraised Value.
202947_13_ITEM8_P44_S1	On May 1, 2012, the Company gave Global notice of non-extension of the Global lease.
202947_13_ITEM8_P44_S2	Accordingly, the Global lease will expire on April 30, 2013.
202947_13_ITEM8_P44_S3	Global is solely responsible for the removal of its inventory and the cleaning of the tanks prior to May 1, 2013 and the costs associated with these activities.
202947_13_ITEM8_P44_S4	Management has prepared, and the Board has approved, a marketing plan for the Facility.
202947_13_ITEM8_P44_S5	Pursuant to the plan, the Company is marketing the Facility for lease to multiple users for temporary storage and distribution of heating oil and Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel ( ULSD ).
202947_13_ITEM8_P44_S6	Management cannot presently determine when such future arrangements will commence and the financial terms thereof.
202947_13_ITEM8_P44_S7	The monthly rent at January 1, 2011 was $303,000 and increased to $311,000 in May 2011 and $319,000 in May 2012, as a result of the scheduled annual cost-of-living adjustments.
202947_13_ITEM8_P44_S8	In addition, Global reimburses the Company for real property taxes in excess of $106,000 annually and certain other expenses as required by the lease.
202947_13_ITEM8_P45_S0	The Pier is a deep-water pier in East Providence, Rhode Island owned by the Company which is integral to the operation of the Terminal.
202947_13_ITEM8_P45_S1	The Pier and the Terminal are connected by two petroleum pipelines which the Company has a permanent right to use.
202947_13_ITEM8_P46_S0	On August 31, 2011, while excavating in connection with the construction of a highway for the Rhode Island Department of Transportation ( RIDOT ), Cardi Corporation ( Cardi ) ruptured an underground pipeline controlled and used by the Company for the transportation of ULSD from the Wilkesbarre Pier to its Petroleum Storage Facility.
202947_13_ITEM8_P46_S1	At the time, the Company was receiving product from a barge and, as a result of the rupture, approximately 70,000 gallons of ULSD were discharged.
202947_13_ITEM8_P47_S0	Pursuant to the Company s Emergency Response Plan, representatives of the Company took control of the spill site and coordinated the response of various governmental agencies as well as private contractors.
202947_13_ITEM8_P47_S1	Approximately 56,000 gallons of spilled diesel were recovered.
202947_13_ITEM8_P47_S2	On September 6, 2011, the Company turned over the responsibility for the cleanup to Cardi.
202947_13_ITEM8_P47_S3	The Company notified the required government agencies and its insurance carriers of the rupture.
202947_13_ITEM8_P47_S4	Management s estimate of the total cost incurred by the Company in responding to the emergency and repairing the pipeline was $349,000, which amount was accrued as an expense at September 30, 2011, and the Company determined that no receivable could be recorded at that time.
202947_13_ITEM8_P47_S5	In November 2011, Cardi paid the Company $89,000, which amount was offset against the expense previously recorded.
202947_13_ITEM8_P47_S6	During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company paid an additional $14,000 in connection with the pipeline rupture.
202947_13_ITEM8_P47_S7	At December 31, 2011, the Company determined that $184,000 of the remaining liability was assumed by Cardi.
202947_13_ITEM8_P47_S8	The Company reduced the previously recorded liability and expense by that amount.
202947_13_ITEM8_P47_S9	In February 2012, Cardi paid the $184,000.
202947_13_ITEM8_P47_S10	In May 2012, Cardi paid both the remaining $76,000 and the $14,000, and the Company reduced the accrued liability and recorded the $90,000 as a reduction of expense on the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2012.
202947_13_ITEM8_P48_S0	In March 2011, management learned that, during the normal receipt of product from a barge, No. 2 heating oil (high sulfur heating oil) was accidentally pumped into one of the Company s ULSD petroleum storage tanks (Tank 67), resulting in a mixture with a sulfur content in excess of that allowed by the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ).
202947_13_ITEM8_P48_S1	The Company notified Global and its insurance carriers of the incident.
202947_13_ITEM8_P49_S0	Global informed the Company that it had contacted its customers that received the mixture and commenced a sampling and testing program with certain of its customers to determine (1) if any product should be removed and replaced with conforming product or (2) if the product need only be treated to meet the EPA requirements.
202947_13_ITEM8_P50_S0	In August 2011, Global asserted a claim against the Company of $132,000 for damages incurred by Global arising out of the incident, which amount was accrued as an expense at September 30, 2011.
202947_13_ITEM8_P50_S1	At December 31, 2011, the Company determined that its insurance carrier had assumed this liability, and the Company reduced the previously recorded liability and expense by that amount.
202947_13_ITEM8_P50_S2	In March 2012, the Company s insurance carrier paid Global the full amount of its claim, and Global released the Company of all liability relating to this incident.
202947_13_ITEM8_P51_S0	In August 2010, during a regular facility inspection of the Terminal, a release of petroleum-contaminated water was discovered from the tank bottom of one of the Company s 150,000 barrel tanks (Tank 153).
202947_13_ITEM8_P51_S1	The Company notified the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management ( RIDEM ), the EPA and the United States Coast Guard.
202947_13_ITEM8_P51_S2	It also notified its insurance carriers of the release and the damage to the tank.
202947_13_ITEM8_P51_S3	The tank was emptied of product and the cleaning of the tank bottom was completed in September 2010.
202947_13_ITEM8_P51_S4	The petroleum-contaminated water released from the tank was contained on the secondary containment liner under the tank bottom, preventing contamination of the groundwater.
202947_13_ITEM8_P51_S5	The Company engaged an outside engineering firm to inspect the tank bottom to determine the cause and location of the release, as well as the extent of the required repairs.
202947_13_ITEM8_P51_S6	The findings of the inspection indicated that aggressive corrosion from inside the tank occurred, causing two holes in the immediate vicinity of the observed release, as well as several other holes or potential holes in other areas of the tank bottom.
202947_13_ITEM8_P51_S7	The report concluded that the corrosion was caused by microbial contamination, which was affirmed by a corrosion specialist.
202947_13_ITEM8_P51_S8	The final cost of the cleanup, inspection and repair of the tank was $533,000, all of which was recorded as an expense at December 31, 2010.
202947_13_ITEM8_P51_S9	The tank was placed back in service in February 2011.
202947_13_ITEM8_P51_S10	In June 2011, Global paid the Company $458,000 which is recorded in petroleum storage facility revenues, reimbursement of tank repairs on the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2011.
202947_13_ITEM8_P51_S11	The difference relates to the $75,000 cost of epoxy coating the bottom of Tank 153 which the Company paid.
202947_13_ITEM8_P52_S0	The testing of certain of the Company s other tanks revealed the presence of corrosive microbial contaminants in Tanks 151 and 32.
202947_13_ITEM8_P52_S1	Both tanks were treated with a biocide and continue to be monitored and treated as necessary.
202947_13_ITEM8_P52_S2	Since Tank 32 had been inspected in June 2010, the Company believes that the contaminants have not affected the integrity of this tank bottom.
202947_13_ITEM8_P52_S3	However, since Tank 151 had not been inspected since construction in 2006, the Company took this tank out of service in February 2011.
202947_13_ITEM8_P52_S4	The tank was emptied of product, and an inspection of the tank bottom revealed minor corrosion.
202947_13_ITEM8_P52_S5	The Company completed the repairs recommended by the inspectors and applied an epoxy coating to the bottom of Tank 151 at a cost of $50,000, which has been included in petroleum storage facility expenses, operating on the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2011.
202947_13_ITEM8_P52_S6	The tank was back in service in May 2011.
202947_13_ITEM8_P52_S7	Exclusive of the epoxy coating, the total cost of cleanup, inspection and repair of Tanks 151 and 32 was $40,000 which Global paid the Company in September 2011 and is recorded in petroleum storage facilities revenues, reimbursement of tank repairs on the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2011.
202947_13_ITEM8_P52_S8	Tank repairs related to this incident have been presented as a separate line item within petroleum storage facility expenses on the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2011.
202947_13_ITEM8_P52_S9	Routine tank repairs continue to be included with petroleum storage facility operating expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
202947_13_ITEM8_P53_S0	Environmental incident (2002): In 2002, during testing of monitoring wells at the Terminal, the Company s consulting engineer discovered free floating phase product in a groundwater monitoring well located on that portion of the Terminal purchased in 2000.
202947_13_ITEM8_P53_S1	Laboratory analysis indicated that the product was gasoline, which is not a product the Company ever stored at the Terminal.
202947_13_ITEM8_P53_S2	The Company commenced an environmental investigation and analysis, the results of which indicate that the gasoline did not come from the Terminal.
202947_13_ITEM8_P53_S3	RIDEM subsequently identified Power Test Realty Partnership ( Power Test ), the owner of an adjacent parcel, as a potentially responsible party for the contamination.
202947_13_ITEM8_P53_S4	Getty Properties Corp. is the general partner of Power Test.
202947_13_ITEM8_P54_S0	Power Test challenged that determination and, after an administrative hearing, in October 2008 a RIDEM Hearing Officer determined that Power Test is responsible for the discharge of the petroleum product under the Rhode Island Oil Pollution Control Act, R.I.G.L. Section 46-12.5.1-3 and Rule 6(a) and 12(b) of the Oil Pollution Control Regulations.
202947_13_ITEM8_P54_S1	The RIDEM Decision and Order requires Power Test to remediate the contamination as directed by RIDEM and remanded the proposed penalty to RIDEM for recalculation.
202947_13_ITEM8_P54_S2	In November 2008, Power Test appealed the decision to the Rhode Island Superior Court.
202947_13_ITEM8_P55_S0	Order of the Hearing Officer pending a clarification by RIDEM of the amount of the proposed penalty.
202947_13_ITEM8_P55_S1	In October 2009, RIDEM issued a recalculated administrative penalty, and, subsequently, the RIDEM Hearing Officer issued a recommended amended decision, which was affirmed as a final decision by the RIDEM Director in December 2009.
202947_13_ITEM8_P55_S2	In January 2010, Power Test appealed that decision to Superior Court.
202947_13_ITEM8_P55_S3	In September 2011, the Superior Court affirmed the decision of the RIDEM director.
202947_13_ITEM8_P55_S4	Power Test has appealed that decision to the Rhode Island Supreme Court.
202947_13_ITEM8_P56_S0	In April 2009, the Company sued Power Test and Getty Properties Corp. in the Rhode Island Superior Court seeking remediation of the site or, in the alternative, the cost of the remediation.
202947_13_ITEM8_P56_S1	On May 1, 2009, Power Test and Getty Properties Corp. removed the action to the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island ( the Court ).
202947_13_ITEM8_P57_S0	On May 22, 2009, Power Test and Getty Properties Corp. answered the Complaint and filed a Counterclaim against Dunellen, LLC and Capital Terminal Company alleging that Dunellen, LLC and Capital Terminal Company are responsible for the contamination.
202947_13_ITEM8_P57_S1	Getty Properties Corp. and Power Test joined Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc., the tenant under a long-term lease with Getty Properties Corp. of the adjacent property, as a defendant.
202947_13_ITEM8_P57_S2	The Company amended its Complaint to add Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. as a defendant.
202947_13_ITEM8_P57_S3	Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. moved for summary judgment against the Company, Getty Properties Corp. and Power Test.
202947_13_ITEM8_P58_S0	On December 5, 2011, Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
202947_13_ITEM8_P58_S1	Thereafter, with Bankruptcy Court approval, Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. rejected its lease with Getty Properties Corp.
202947_13_ITEM8_P58_S2	On August 24, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court approved a plan to liquidate Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc.
202947_13_ITEM8_P58_S3	On January 15, 2013, the Court granted Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. s motion for summary judgment against the Company, Getty Properties Corp. and Power Test, dismissing the Company s third-party complaint.
202947_13_ITEM8_P58_S4	The parties are awaiting a scheduling order from the Court.
202947_13_ITEM8_P58_S5	There can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in this litigation.
202947_13_ITEM8_P58_S6	Since January 2003, the Company has not incurred significant costs in connection with this matter, other than ongoing litigation costs, and is unable to determine the costs it might incur to remedy the situation, as well as any costs to investigate, defend and seek reimbursement from the responsible party with respect to this contamination.
202947_13_ITEM8_P59_S0	In 1994, a leak was discovered in a 25,000 barrel storage tank at the Terminal which allowed the escape of a small amount of fuel oil.
202947_13_ITEM8_P59_S1	All required notices were made to RIDEM.
202947_13_ITEM8_P59_S2	In 2000, the tank was demolished and testing of the groundwater indicated that there was no large pooling of contaminants.
202947_13_ITEM8_P60_S0	In 2001, RIDEM approved a plan pursuant to which the Company installed a passive system consisting of three wells and commenced monitoring the wells.
202947_13_ITEM8_P60_S1	In 2003, RIDEM decided that the passive monitoring system previously approved was not sufficient and required the Company to design an active remediation system for the removal of product from the contaminated site.
202947_13_ITEM8_P60_S2	The Company and its consulting engineers began the pre-design testing of the site in the fourth quarter of 2004.
202947_13_ITEM8_P60_S3	The consulting engineers estimated a total cost of $200,000 to design, install and operate the system, which amount was accrued in 2004.
202947_13_ITEM8_P60_S4	Through 2006, the Company had expended $119,000 and has not incurred any additional costs since then.
202947_13_ITEM8_P60_S5	In 2011, RIDEM notified the company to proceed with the next phase of the approval process, notifying the abutters of the proposed remediation system even though RIDEM has not yet taken any action on the Company s proposed plan.
202947_13_ITEM8_P61_S0	As designed, the system will pump out the contaminants which will be disposed of in compliance with applicable regulations.
202947_13_ITEM8_P61_S1	After a period of time, the groundwater will be tested to determine if sufficient contaminants have been removed.
202947_13_ITEM8_P61_S2	While the Company and its consulting engineers believe that the proposed active remediation system will correct the situation, it is possible that RIDEM could require the Company to expand remediation efforts, which could result in the Company incurring costs in excess of the remaining accrual of $81,000.
202947_13_ITEM8_P62_S0	Income tax expense (benefit) is comprised of the following components:
202947_13_ITEM8_P63_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, a reconciliation of the income tax provision as computed by applying the United States income tax rate (34%) to income before income taxes is as follows:
202947_13_ITEM8_P64_S0	Deferred income taxes are recorded based upon differences between financial statement and tax basis amounts of assets and liabilities.
202947_13_ITEM8_P64_S1	The tax effects of temporary differences which give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:
202947_13_ITEM8_P65_S0	The Company s federal and various state income tax returns for the years subsequent to 2008 remain subject to examination.
202947_13_ITEM8_P65_S1	The Company follows GAAP when reviewing all its tax positions and has determined that no reserves are required.
202947_13_ITEM8_P66_S0	In November 2008, the Company restated its Articles of Incorporation:
202947_13_ITEM8_P67_S0	To provide for certain transfer and ownership restrictions as set forth therein.
202947_13_ITEM8_P68_S0	In December 2008, the Company issued (in the form of a stock dividend) 3,299,956 shares of Class B Common Stock on a one-for-one basis for each share of Class A Common Stock held.
202947_13_ITEM8_P68_S1	The holders of Class A and Class B Common Stock vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to the shareholders of the Company except for the election of the Board of Directors and except in connection with certain major corporate actions, including a sale of the Company.
202947_13_ITEM8_P68_S2	The holders of Class A Common Stock, voting as a separate class, elect one-third of the Board of Directors.
202947_13_ITEM8_P68_S3	The holders of Class B Common Stock, voting as a separate class, elect the remainder of the Board of Directors.
202947_13_ITEM8_P68_S4	Class B Common Stock is convertible by the record owner thereof into the same number of shares of Class A Common Stock at any time.
202947_13_ITEM8_P68_S5	For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, the number of shares converted was 45,586 shares and 16,318 shares, respectively.
202947_13_ITEM8_P69_S0	The Class A Common Stock is listed on the Premier QX Tier of the OTCQX.
202947_13_ITEM8_P69_S1	The Class B Common Stock is not listed on any national or regional stock exchange, or on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation National Market System or on the OTCQX.
202947_13_ITEM8_P70_S0	The holders of Class A and Class B Common Stock share equally in the earnings of the Company and in dividends declared by the Company.
202947_13_ITEM8_P71_S0	The Company s Restated Articles of Incorporation prohibits any shareholder from acquiring more than a 5% interest in the Company s classes of common stock and prohibits any shareholder or any beneficial owner who, at the time of the filing of the Restated Articles of Incorporation owned 5% or more of the Company s classes of common stock from increasing their aggregate percentage ownership of both classes of common stock.
202947_13_ITEM8_P71_S1	Should a shareholder acquire a number of shares that results in the limitation being exceeded, shares in excess of the limitation would be automatically converted into an equal number of shares of Excess Stock, which class was authorized pursuant to the 2001 Amendment to the Company s Articles of Incorporation.
202947_13_ITEM8_P71_S2	Excess Stock is non-voting and is not entitled to dividends.
202947_13_ITEM8_P71_S3	However, the shareholder may designate a qualifying transferee for shares of Excess Stock, at which time such shares would be converted and reissued as Class A or Class B Common shares as the case may be.
202947_13_ITEM8_P72_S0	The purpose for creating the Class B Common Stock was to put the Company in the position to qualify to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ).
202947_13_ITEM8_P72_S1	One of the qualifications to be taxed as a REIT is that no more than 50% of the shares of a company can be held by five or fewer individuals during the last half of each taxable year.
202947_13_ITEM8_P72_S2	Currently, the majority shareholder controls 52.3% of the Company s outstanding common stock and three other shareholders each own more than 5% of the Company s outstanding common stock.
202947_13_ITEM8_P72_S3	In order for the Company to qualify to be taxed as a REIT, the major shareholders ownership of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock would need to be reduced below the 50% level.
202947_13_ITEM8_P72_S4	On January 29, 2013, the Board of Directors of the Company approved submitting to the shareholders at the 2013 annual meeting Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation which, among other things, would eliminate the Class B Common shares and automatically convert all Class B Common shares into an equivalent number of Class A Common shares, and all restrictions that presently exist with respect to the ownership of Class A and Class B Common stock would be eliminated.
202947_13_ITEM8_P72_S5	The Board took this action after concluding that conversion to a REIT was unlikely to occur at any time in the foreseeable future.
202947_13_ITEM8_P72_S6	On December 7, 2012, the Company s Board of Directors declared a dividend of $2.25 per share ($14,850,000) to shareholders of record as of December 17, 2012.
202947_13_ITEM8_P72_S7	For shareholders owning 100 or more shares, the dividend was payable 20%, or $.45 per share, in cash and 80%, or $1.80 per share, in Dividend Notes to be issued by the Company.
202947_13_ITEM8_P72_S8	Shareholders owning less than 100 shares of any class of Company stock where the shares were titled in their names and not held by a broker, received 100% of the dividend in cash unless they elected to receive it 20% in cash and 80% in Dividend Notes.
202947_13_ITEM8_P72_S9	The dividend was paid on December 27, 2012, at which time the Company paid out $3,063,000 in cash, and issued $11,787,000 in 5% Dividend Notes described in Note 4 above.
202947_13_ITEM8_P72_S10	In accordance with GAAP, at December 7, 2012, the Company s retained earnings of $3,870,000 was reduced to zero and the remaining $10,980,000 was offset against capital in excess of par.
202947_13_ITEM8_P72_S11	In connection with the declaration of the dividend, the Company s Board of Directors received a solvency opinion from an investment banking firm to the effect that the dividend would not result in the Company s liabilities exceeding its assets and would not render the Company insolvent.
202947_13_ITEM8_P73_S0	Operating segment disclosures: The Company operates in two segments: (1) Leasing and (2) Petroleum Storage.
202947_13_ITEM8_P73_S1	The Company makes decisions relative to the allocation of resources and evaluates performance based on each segment s respective income before income taxes, excluding interest expense and certain corporate expenses.
202947_13_ITEM8_P73_S2	Inter-segment revenues are immaterial in amount.

202947_13_ITEM8_P76_S0	Related party transaction: The Company and Providence and Worcester Railroad Company ( the Railroad ) have a common controlling shareholder.
202947_13_ITEM8_P77_S0	The Company has the right to use certain pipelines located in the right of way of the Railroad which were constructed by Getty Oil Company (Eastern Operations), Inc. ( GettyEO ).
202947_13_ITEM8_P77_S1	Pursuant to an agreement between the Railroad and GettyEO dated August 6, 1975, the Railroad has the right to relocate any portion of the pipelines located within the Railroad s right of way.
202947_13_ITEM8_P78_S0	The Company supported the extension of Waterfront Drive, so-called, up to Dexter Road and adjacent to the Company s Terminal, which road was constructed on the Railroad right of way.
202947_13_ITEM8_P78_S1	The road was completed in November 2012.
202947_13_ITEM8_P79_S0	The State of Rhode Island s plans for the Waterfront Drive extension required a relocation of a portion of the pipelines which the Railroad had the right to relocate.
202947_13_ITEM8_P79_S1	RIDOT entered into an agreement with the Railroad (the RIDOT Agreement ) to reimburse the Railroad for reasonable costs incurred by it in relocating the pipelines, which were originally estimated to be $159,000.
202947_13_ITEM8_P79_S2	Any substantial change to the estimate requires the approval of RIDOT.
202947_13_ITEM8_P80_S0	In May 2011, the Company entered into an agreement with the Railroad to act as the Railroad s agent with respect to the relocation of the pipelines.
202947_13_ITEM8_P80_S1	The Company, without receiving compensation, is obligated under the agreement to select, direct and supervise all subcontractors subject to the Railroad s approval.
202947_13_ITEM8_P81_S0	Upon the Railroad s receipt of invoices from the contractors, the Railroad requires the Company to verify the accuracy of the invoices and submit a check to the Railroad covering the amount of the invoices.
202947_13_ITEM8_P81_S1	The Railroad pays the invoices, using the funds advanced by the Company.
202947_13_ITEM8_P81_S2	The Railroad is then obligated to submit the invoices to RIDOT for reimbursement.
202947_13_ITEM8_P81_S3	Any reimbursements received by the Railroad from RIDOT are required to be paid to the Company in a timely manner.
202947_13_ITEM8_P81_S4	Any shortfall in RIDOT s reimbursement is borne by the Company.
202947_13_ITEM8_P81_S5	At December 31, 2011, costs incurred to relocate the pipeline totaled $219,000, which amount is included in prepaid and other on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2011.
202947_13_ITEM8_P81_S6	The Railroad submitted the total amount to RIDOT in February 2012; in March and December 2012, RIDOT reimbursed the Railroad a total of $198,000, which the Railroad in turn paid to the Company.
202947_13_ITEM8_P81_S7	RIDOT has retained the remaining $21,000 pending its audit of the project, which amount is included in prepaid and other on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2012.
202947_13_ITEM8_P81_S8	The Company believes the remaining $21,000 will ultimately be paid.
202947_13_ITEM9_P0_S0	There were no changes in, or disagreements with, accountants on accounting or financial disclosure as defined by Item 304 of Regulation S-K.
202947_13_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Under the supervision of the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report.
202947_13_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of such date, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in making them aware on a timely basis of the material information relating to the Company required to be included in the Company s periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
202947_13_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act).
202947_13_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Company s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of its financial reporting and the preparation of published financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.
202947_13_ITEM9A_P1_S2	However, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
202947_13_ITEM9A_P1_S3	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
202947_13_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies may deteriorate.
202947_13_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management conducted its evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) as of December 31, 2012.
202947_13_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Based on this assessment, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer believe that as of December 31, 2012, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on criteria set forth by COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.
202947_13_ITEM9A_P2_S2	This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
202947_13_ITEM9A_P2_S3	Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report.
202947_13_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the quarter ended December 31, 2012, there has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

202947_14_ITEM1_P1_S0	The current economic conditions have had limited impact on the Company s results of operations to date.
202947_14_ITEM1_P1_S1	As none of the Company s leases require the tenant to provide financial information, the Company has no information concerning the impact of current economic conditions on its major tenants.
202947_14_ITEM1_P1_S2	The Company has not experienced any defaults under its long-term leases after construction of improvements has been undertaken.
202947_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	Segments The Company operates in two segments: leasing and petroleum storage.
202947_14_ITEM1_P2_S1	For financial information, see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
202947_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	The leasing segment is principally devoted to the leasing of Company-owned land in the Capital Center area ( Capital Center ) in downtown Providence, Rhode Island under long-term ground leases.
202947_14_ITEM1_P3_S1	The Company owns approximately 18 acres in the Capital Center consisting of 13 individual parcels.
202947_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	The Capital Center (approximately 77 acres of land) is the result of a development project undertaken by the State of Rhode Island, the City of Providence, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation ( Amtrak ) and the Company during the 1980 s in which two rivers, the Moshassuck and the Woonasquatucket, were moved, Amtrak s Northeast Corridor rail line was relocated, a new Amtrak/commuter railroad station was constructed and significant public improvements were made to improve pedestrian and vehicular traffic in the area.
202947_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	With the exception of the Steeple Street property, the Company has not acted, and does not intend to act, as a developer with respect to any improvements constructed on Company-owned parcels.
202947_14_ITEM1_P5_S1	Rather, the Company offers individual parcels for lease pursuant to long-term ground leases with terms of 99 years or more.
202947_14_ITEM1_P5_S2	Each lease contains provisions permitting the tenant to develop the parcel under certain terms and conditions.
202947_14_ITEM1_P5_S3	Each lease provides for periodic rent adjustments of various kinds.
202947_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	Under the leases, the tenants are responsible for insuring the Company against various hazards and events.
202947_14_ITEM1_P6_S1	Each tenant is required to indemnify the Company with respect to all of the tenant s activities on the land.
202947_14_ITEM1_P6_S2	The leases contain other terms and conditions customary to such instruments.
202947_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	The Company first began offering parcels for lease in the Capital Center area in the late 1980 s.
202947_14_ITEM1_P7_S1	As of December 31, 2013, nine parcels have been leased by the Company under long-term leases of 99 years or more.
202947_14_ITEM1_P7_S2	Of the nine parcels, seven have improvements constructed thereon as follows:
202947_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	While seeking developers, the Company also leases Parcels 3E, 3W, 4E and 4W in the Capital Center area for public parking purposes on a short-term basis to Metropark, Ltd.
202947_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	Parcel 20 Adjacent to the Capital Center Since the 1980 s, the Company has owned an undeveloped parcel of land adjacent to the Capital Center, which is leased out for public parking purposes on a short-term basis.
202947_14_ITEM1_P9_S1	In 2007, the Company purchased the adjacent parcel containing a three/four-story 18,000 square foot building (the Steeple Street Building ) and related land for $2,329,000, which, together with the previously-owned land, now comprises Parcel 20, containing 26,600 square feet.
202947_14_ITEM1_P9_S2	The Steeple Street Building is on the State Registry of Historic Buildings.
202947_14_ITEM1_P9_S3	During 2010-11, the Company substantially rehabilitated the Building.
202947_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	The Building has three commercial tenants with additional space available for lease.
202947_14_ITEM1_P10_S1	All of the properties described above are shown on a map contained in Exhibit 20.1.
202947_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	Lamar Lease The Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, leases 23 outdoor advertising locations containing 44 billboard faces along interstate and primary highways in Rhode Island and Massachusetts to Lamar Outdoor Advertising, LLC ( Lamar ) under a lease which now expires in 2045.
202947_14_ITEM1_P11_S1	All but one of these locations are controlled by the Company through permanent easements granted to the Company pursuant to an agreement between the Company and Providence Worcester Railroad Company, a related company ( Railroad the remaining location is leased by the Company from a third party with a remaining term of eighteen months with an option to renew for an additional five years.
202947_14_ITEM1_P11_S2	Although no new locations have been added since 2002, in 2013 Lamar converted billboards at two locations to electronic boards, which conversions extended the term of the lease for a total of twelve years to 2045.
202947_14_ITEM1_P11_S3	Lamar has a right of first refusal for additional billboard location sites acquired by the Company in New England and Metropolitan New York City.
202947_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	The lease with Lamar provides, among other things, for the following: (1) the base rent will increase annually at the rate of 2.75% for each leased billboard location commencing June 1, 2006 and on each June 1 thereafter; and (2) in addition to base rent, for each 12-month period commencing each June 1, Lamar must pay to the Company 30% of the gross revenues from each standard billboard and 20% of the gross revenues from each electronic billboard for such 12-month period, reduced by the sum of (a) commissions paid to third parties and (b) the base monthly rent for each leased billboard display for such 12-month period.
202947_14_ITEM1_P12_S1	The Lamar lease contains other terms and conditions customary to such instruments.
202947_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	The Company has the right to require the Railroad to grant to it additional permanent easements for the location of billboards along the Railroad s right-of-way on commercially reasonable terms.

202947_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	Major tenants: The following table sets forth those major tenants whose revenues exceed 10 percent of the Company s leasing segment revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012:
202947_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	* Amounts which do not represent greater than 10 percent in 2012 but are presented for comparative purposes only Competition The Company competes for tenants with other owners of undeveloped real property in downtown Providence.
202947_14_ITEM1_P15_S1	The Company maintains no listing of other competitive properties and will not engage in a competitive bid arrangement with proposed developers.
202947_14_ITEM1_P15_S2	The Company s refusal to sell the land that it owns may restrict the number of interested developers.
202947_14_ITEM1_P15_S3	As to the Steeple Street Building, the Company competes for tenants with other office and commercial buildings located in downtown Providence.
202947_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	The leasing segment has two employees.
202947_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	Petroleum Storage Terminal and Pier Facility The Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Dunellen, LLC, owns a petroleum storage terminal containing 1,004,000 shell barrels (the Terminal ) and the Wilkesbarre Pier (the Pier ), collectively referred to as the Facility, located in East Providence, Rhode Island.
202947_14_ITEM1_P17_S1	The Terminal utilizes the Pier and pipelines connecting the Pier to the Terminal.
202947_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	For the period May 1, 1998 to April 30, 2013, the Company leased the Facility to Global Companies, LLC ( Global ) for the storage and sale of petroleum distillates and operated the Facility for Global pursuant to a contract with another Company subsidiary, Capital Terminal Company.
202947_14_ITEM1_P18_S1	The Company was responsible for labor, insurance, a portion of the real property taxes and other operating expenses, as well as certain capital improvements.
202947_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	Under the terms of the Option Agreement between the Company and Global dated June 9, 2003 (the Option Agreement ), on April 27, 2012, Global preliminarily exercised its option to purchase the Company s Facility.
202947_14_ITEM1_P19_S1	In compliance with the Option Agreement, the Company thereafter provided Global with a calculation of Adjusted Book Value (as that term is defined in the Option Agreement) of the Facility, which amounted to $19,700,000.
202947_14_ITEM1_P19_S2	Global then elected to proceed with the determination of Appraised Value (as defined in the Option Agreement).
202947_14_ITEM1_P19_S3	Global and the Company each selected an appraiser and elected to defer selection of a third appraiser until their respective appraisers completed their appraisals and discussed the results.
202947_14_ITEM1_P19_S4	The Company s appraiser arrived at an appraised value of $46,200,000 for the Facility.
202947_14_ITEM1_P19_S5	Global s appraiser arrived at a value of $15,400,000 for the Facility.
202947_14_ITEM1_P19_S6	As required by the Option Agreement, the two appraisers then engaged a third appraiser who on May 17, 2013 appraised the Facility at $35,000,000.
202947_14_ITEM1_P19_S7	Global had ten business days following the receipt of the third appraisal to elect to proceed with a feasibility study of the Facility, which it failed to do.
202947_14_ITEM1_P19_S8	As a result, the Option Agreement terminated on June 3, 2013.
202947_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	Termination of Global Lease: On May 1, 2012, the Company gave Global notice of non-extension of the Global lease.
202947_14_ITEM1_P20_S1	Global was solely responsible for the removal of its inventory and the cleaning of the tanks prior to May 1, 2013 and the costs associated with these activities.
202947_14_ITEM1_P20_S2	The Global lease terminated on April 30, 2013, and the Company took full control of the Facility on that date.
202947_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	Prior to April 30, 2013, Global completed the removal of product and the cleaning of the tanks.
202947_14_ITEM1_P21_S1	The final inspection report indicated that two tanks required repairs, which repairs were done by the Company and the costs reimbursed by Global.
202947_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	Effective September 1, 2013, the Company entered into a through-put lease with Atlantic Trading Marketing, Inc. ( ATMI ) for 425,000 shell barrels for a term of eight months with automatic three-month extensions unless terminated by either party.
202947_14_ITEM1_P22_S1	In addition, the Company granted ATMI a month-to-month option to lease up to 220,000 additional barrels on an as-used basis.
202947_14_ITEM1_P22_S2	Under the terms of the ATMI lease, the Company provides terminaling services related to the receipt, storage and delivery at the Terminal s loading rack to customers of ATMI s marketing agent.
202947_14_ITEM1_P22_S3	ATMI has notified the Company that it will vacate the Facility on April 30, 2014.
202947_14_ITEM1_P22_S4	Subsequent to its notice of nonrenewal, ATMI expressed interest in negotiating an extension of its lease through April 30, 2015, at a reduced rent for the summer months.
202947_14_ITEM1_P22_S5	There is no assurance that the Company and ATMI will reach agreement on an extension.
202947_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	Marketing Plan Management prepared, and the Board approved, a marketing plan for the Facility.
202947_14_ITEM1_P23_S1	In light of ATMI s decision to terminate its lease as of April 30, 2014, the Company is currently marketing the Terminal for lease and is considering all of its other options with respect to the Facility.
202947_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	To the extent the Company is unsuccessful in renting at least a significant portion of the Terminal at favorable rates, there could be a material adverse impact on the Company s revenues and its net income.
202947_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	The operation of a petroleum storage facility carries with it the risk of environmental contamination.
202947_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	Pipeline rupture (2011): On August 31, 2011, while excavating in connection with the construction of a highway for the Rhode Island Department of Transportation ( RIDOT ), Cardi Corporation ( Cardi ) ruptured an underground pipeline controlled and used by the Company for the transportation of ULSD from the Wilkesbarre Pier to the Terminal.
202947_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	At the time, the Company was receiving product from a barge and, as a result of the rupture, approximately 70,000 gallons of ULSD were discharged.
202947_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	Pursuant to the Company s Emergency Response Plan, representatives of the Company took control of the spill site and coordinated the response of various governmental agencies as well as private contractors.
202947_14_ITEM1_P27_S1	Approximately 56,000 gallons of spilled diesel were recovered.
202947_14_ITEM1_P27_S2	On September 6, 2011, the Company turned over the responsibility for the cleanup to Cardi.
202947_14_ITEM1_P27_S3	The Company notified the required government agencies and its insurance carriers of the rupture.
202947_14_ITEM1_P27_S4	The total cost incurred by the Company in responding to the emergency and repairing the pipeline was $363,000.
202947_14_ITEM1_P27_S5	Cardi paid the Company as follows: $89,000 in November 2011, $184,000 in February 2012, and the balance of $90,000 in May 2012.
202947_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	Environmental incident (2002): In 2002, during testing of monitoring wells at the Terminal, the Company s consulting engineer discovered free floating phase product in a groundwater monitoring well located on that portion of the Terminal purchased in 2000.
202947_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	Company ever stored at the Terminal.
202947_14_ITEM1_P29_S1	The Company commenced an environmental investigation and analysis, the results of which indicate that the gasoline did not come from the Terminal.
202947_14_ITEM1_P29_S2	RIDEM subsequently identified Power Test Realty Partnership ( Power Test ), the owner of an adjacent parcel, as a potentially responsible party for the contamination.
202947_14_ITEM1_P29_S3	Getty Properties Corp. is the general partner of Power Test.
202947_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	Power Test challenged that determination and, after an administrative hearing, in October 2008 a RIDEM Hearing Officer determined that Power Test is responsible for the discharge of the petroleum product under the Rhode Island Oil Pollution Control Act, R.I.G.L. Section 46-12.5.1-3 and Rule 6(a) and 12(b) of the Oil Pollution Control Regulations.
202947_14_ITEM1_P30_S1	The RIDEM Decision and Order requires Power Test to remediate the contamination as directed by RIDEM and remanded the proposed penalty to RIDEM for recalculation.
202947_14_ITEM1_P30_S2	In November 2008, Power Test appealed the decision to the Rhode Island Superior Court.
202947_14_ITEM1_P30_S3	In addition, in November 2008, Power Test sought, and received, a stay of the Decision and Order of the Hearing Officer pending a clarification by RIDEM of the amount of the proposed penalty.
202947_14_ITEM1_P30_S4	In October 2009, RIDEM issued a recalculated administrative penalty, and, subsequently, the RIDEM Hearing Officer issued a recommended amended decision, which was affirmed as a final decision by the RIDEM Director in December 2009.
202947_14_ITEM1_P30_S5	In January 2010, Power Test appealed that decision to Superior Court.
202947_14_ITEM1_P30_S6	In September 2011, the Superior Court affirmed the decision of the RIDEM director.
202947_14_ITEM1_P30_S7	Power Test has appealed that decision to the Rhode Island Supreme Court.
202947_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	In April 2009, the Company sued Power Test and Getty Properties Corp. in the Rhode Island Superior Court seeking remediation of the site or, in the alternative, the cost of the remediation.
202947_14_ITEM1_P31_S1	On May 1, 2009, Power Test and Getty Properties Corp. removed the action to the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island ( the Court ).
202947_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	On May 22, 2009, Power Test and Getty Properties Corp. answered the Complaint and filed a Counterclaim against Dunellen, LLC and Capital Terminal Company alleging that Dunellen, LLC and Capital Terminal Company are responsible for the contamination.
202947_14_ITEM1_P32_S1	Getty Properties Corp. and Power Test joined Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc., the tenant under a long-term lease with Getty Properties Corp. of the adjacent property, as a defendant.
202947_14_ITEM1_P32_S2	The Company amended its Complaint to add Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. as a defendant.
202947_14_ITEM1_P32_S3	Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. moved for summary judgment against the Company, Getty Properties Corp. and Power Test.
202947_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	On December 5, 2011, Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
202947_14_ITEM1_P33_S1	Thereafter, with Bankruptcy Court approval, Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. rejected its lease with Getty Properties Corp.
202947_14_ITEM1_P33_S2	On August 24, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court approved a plan to liquidate Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc.
202947_14_ITEM1_P33_S3	On January 15, 2013, the Court granted Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. s motion for summary judgment against the Company, Getty Properties Corp. and Power Test, dismissing the Company s third-party complaint.
202947_14_ITEM1_P33_S4	The parties have agreed to stay the litigation pending a determination by the Rhode Island Supreme Court on the Power Test appeal.
202947_14_ITEM1_P33_S5	There can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in this litigation.
202947_14_ITEM1_P33_S6	Since January 2003, the Company has not incurred significant costs in connection with this matter, other than ongoing litigation costs, and is unable to determine the costs it might incur to remedy the situation, as well as any costs to investigate, defend and seek reimbursement from the responsible party with respect to this contamination.
202947_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	In 1994, a leak was discovered in a 25,000 barrel storage tank at the Terminal which allowed the escape of a small amount of fuel oil.
202947_14_ITEM1_P34_S1	All required notices were made to RIDEM.
202947_14_ITEM1_P34_S2	In 2000, the tank was demolished and testing of the groundwater indicated that there was no large pooling of contaminants.
202947_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	In 2001, RIDEM approved a plan pursuant to which the Company installed a passive system consisting of three wells and commenced monitoring the wells.
202947_14_ITEM1_P35_S1	In 2003, RIDEM decided that the passive monitoring system previously approved was not sufficient and required the Company to design an active remediation system for the removal of product from the contaminated site.
202947_14_ITEM1_P36_S0	The consulting engineers estimated a total cost of $200,000 to design, install and operate the system, which amount was accrued in 2004.
202947_14_ITEM1_P36_S1	Through 2006, the Company had expended $119,000 and has not incurred any additional costs since then.
202947_14_ITEM1_P36_S2	In 2011, RIDEM notified the Company to proceed with the next phase of the approval process, notifying the abutters of the proposed remediation system even though RIDEM has not yet taken any action on the Company s proposed plan.
202947_14_ITEM1_P37_S0	As designed, the system will pump out the contaminants which will be disposed of in compliance with applicable regulations.
202947_14_ITEM1_P37_S1	After a period of time, the groundwater will be tested to determine if sufficient contaminants have been removed.
202947_14_ITEM1_P37_S2	While the Company and its consulting engineers believe that the proposed active remediation system will correct the situation, it is possible that RIDEM could require the Company to expand remediation efforts, which could result in the Company incurring costs in excess of the remaining accrual of $81,000.
202947_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	The Company manages its exposure to contamination, remediation or similar costs associated with the Facility through adherence to established procedures for operations and equipment maintenance.
202947_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	Insurance The Company maintains what management believes to be adequate levels of insurance, including environmental insurance.
202947_14_ITEM1_P40_S0	Competition The Facility competes with several other similar facilities located on and adjacent to the Providence Harbor.
202947_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	The Terminal has approximately 48% of the total distillate storage capacity in the Providence area.
202947_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	The current tenant, ATMI, competes with other terminal operators on the basis of price, availability and a willingness to advance credit to local wholesalers.
202947_14_ITEM1_P42_S1	The amount of petroleum throughput at the Terminal is a function of the Company s ability to effectively market the Facility for short-term storage and distribution of heating oil and ULSD.
202947_14_ITEM1_P42_S2	The Terminal employs eight people on a full-time basis.
202947_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	either under long-term leases or short-term leases as more particularly described in Item 1, Leasing Segment.
202947_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	The Company also owns or controls 23 locations on which 44 billboard faces have been constructed.
202947_14_ITEM2_P0_S2	All but one these locations are owned by the Company under permanent easements from a related company, the Railroad; the remaining location is leased from an unrelated third party with a remaining term of eighteen months with an option to renew for an additional five years.
202947_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	The Company owns an approximate 10-acre site in East Providence, Rhode Island on which there are located nine petroleum storage tanks and related distribution racks together with a 3,000 square foot single-story office building which houses the Company s headquarters and other support operations.
202947_14_ITEM2_P1_S1	In 2006, the Company completed the development of the land currently owned by the Company at the Terminal.
202947_14_ITEM2_P1_S2	In addition, the Company is the owner of the Pier located in East Providence, Rhode Island.
202947_14_ITEM2_P1_S3	The Pier, which has a deep water draft capacity of -40 feet Mean Low Water, can accommodate ships up to 825 feet in length.
202947_14_ITEM2_P1_S4	The Company has a permanent right to use the pipelines connecting the Pier to the Terminal.
202947_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	The Company s Class A Common Stock is traded on the OTCQX, symbol CPTP.
202947_14_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table shows the high and low trading prices for the Company s Class A Common Stock during the quarterly periods indicated as obtained from the OTCQX, together with cash dividends paid per share during such periods.
202947_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	In connection with the extraordinary dividend declared in December 2012 ($2.25 per common share), $.45 per share was paid in cash and $1.80 per share was paid in Dividend Notes due December 26, 2022, bearing interest at the annual rate of 5% payable semi-annually.
202947_14_ITEM5_P1_S1	Shareholders owning less than 100 shares of any class of Company stock, where the shares were titled in their names and not held by a broker, received 100% of the dividend in cash unless they elected to receive it 20% in cash and 80% in Dividend Notes.
202947_14_ITEM5_P1_S2	In January 2013, the Board of Directors of the Company approved submitting to the shareholders at the 2013 annual meeting Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation which, among other things, eliminated (1) the Class B Common shares and automatically converted all Class B Common shares into an equivalent number of Class A Common shares, (2) all restrictions that existed with respect to the ownership of Class A and Class B Common stock and (3) Excess Stock.
202947_14_ITEM5_P1_S3	On April 23, 2013, the shareholders approved the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation.
202947_14_ITEM5_P2_S0	Information with respect to the high and low trading prices for the Class B Common Stock was not available because the stock was not listed on any exchange, was not quoted by any quotation service, and there was no known market for such Class B Common Stock.
202947_14_ITEM5_P2_S1	At March 3, 2014, there were 470 holders of record of the Company s Class A Common Stock.
202947_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	Critical accounting policies: The Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) has issued guidance for the disclosure of critical accounting policies.
202947_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	The SEC defines such policies as those that require application of management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.
202947_14_ITEM7_P0_S2	The Company s significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
202947_14_ITEM7_P0_S3	Not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates.
202947_14_ITEM7_P0_S4	Management believes that the Company s revenue recognition policy for long-term leases with scheduled rent increases (leasing segment) meets the SEC definition of critical.
202947_14_ITEM7_P0_S5	Certain of the Company s long-term land leases have original terms of 30 to 149 years and contain scheduled rent increases where the future dollar increases are known at the time of the commencement of the lease or at a subsequent date.
202947_14_ITEM7_P0_S6	The first such lease commenced in 1988, had an original term of 99 years and provides for fixed percentage increases at specified intervals (as well as reappraisal increases).
202947_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	In accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) in accounting for leases, rental income related to the fixed percentage increases that are presently known should be recognized on a straight-line basis.
202947_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	To calculate the annual straight-line amount, the 99 known annual rental amounts are totaled and this total is divided by 99.
202947_14_ITEM7_P1_S2	In 2009, a scheduled appraisal occurred, resulting in a rental increase.
202947_14_ITEM7_P1_S3	The Company recalculated the future annual straight-line amount using the remaining years under the lease.
202947_14_ITEM7_P1_S4	The turnaround date discussed below did not change.
202947_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	For this lease, the calculated annual straight-line amount for 1988 was eight times (multiple) the amount paid by the tenant under the terms of the lease (the contractual amount ).
202947_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	In subsequent years, as the tenant pays higher rents, the multiple gradually decreases until the 57 th year of the lease, at which time the contractual amount paid by the tenant will exceed the calculated straight-line amount.
202947_14_ITEM7_P2_S2	If the Company were to report annual revenue for this lease using the straight-line amount, it would record a significant receivable for each of the first 56 years, which receivable would grow to approximately $34,000,000.
202947_14_ITEM7_P2_S3	Management does not believe that the Company should record a receivable that would not begin to be collected until the 56 th year (the turnaround date ) since management could not be assured of collection.
202947_14_ITEM7_P2_S4	In 1988, management met with the SEC accounting staff to discuss its concerns in applying GAAP as it related to a lease of this length which results in the recording of such a significant receivable that would remain on the Company s balance sheet and continue to grow on an annual basis with a turnaround date so far in the future.
202947_14_ITEM7_P2_S5	The Company presented the SEC accounting staff with an application of the accounting policy whereby management would evaluate the collectability of the receivable on an annual basis and report as leasing revenue only that portion of the receivable that management could presently conclude would be collectible.
202947_14_ITEM7_P2_S6	The SEC accounting staff did not object to this application by the Company.
202947_14_ITEM7_P2_S7	Through December 31, 2013, the receivable on this lease has grown to $21,446,000 (cumulative excess of straight-line over contractual rentals) and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround date is still 32 years away.
202947_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	In 2004, a second such lease commenced with an original term of 149 years and provides for fixed minimum percentage increases at specified intervals (as well as reappraisal increases).
202947_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	For this lease, the contractual amount paid by the tenant will not exceed the calculated straight-line amount until the 94 th year of the lease.
202947_14_ITEM7_P3_S2	Through December 31, 2013, the receivable on this lease is $22,423,000 (cumulative excess of straight-line over contractual rentals) and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround date is 84 years away.
202947_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	In 2006, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Agreement of its lease with Lamar Outdoor Advertising LLC ( Lamar ).
202947_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	In 2013, the lease was extended to 2045 following the conversion of billboards at two locations to electronic boards, as required by the lease, resulting in a current remaining term of 32 years which provides for fixed percentage increases annually.
202947_14_ITEM7_P4_S2	For this lease, the contractual amount paid by Lamar will not exceed the calculated straight-line amount until the 23rd year of the extended lease.
202947_14_ITEM7_P4_S3	Through December 31, 2013, the receivable on this lease is $1,510,000 (cumulative excess of straight-line over contractual rentals) and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround date is 16 years away.
202947_14_ITEM7_P4_S4	Accordingly, the Company has not reported any portion of these amounts as leasing revenue in its consolidated financial statements and does not anticipate that it can reach such a conclusion until the turnaround dates are closer.
202947_14_ITEM7_P4_S5	Although the Company s other long-term land leases provide for scheduled rent increases, the provisions of the leases are such that certain future dollar amounts could not be calculated either at the time of the commencement of the lease or now, as such amounts are based on factors that are not presently known, i.e., future cost-of-living adjustments or future appraised values.
202947_14_ITEM7_P4_S6	Through December 31, 2013, the receivable on these leases is $12,342,000 and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround dates are approximately 47 years away.
202947_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	Segments: The Company operates in two segments: leasing and petroleum storage.
202947_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	The leasing segment consists of the long-term leasing of certain of its real estate interests in downtown Providence, Rhode Island (upon the commencement of which the tenants have been required to construct buildings thereon, with the exception of the parking garage and Parcels 6B and 6C), the leasing of a portion of the Steeple Street Building under short-term leasing arrangements and the leasing of locations along interstate and primary highways in Rhode Island and Massachusetts to Lamar which has constructed outdoor advertising boards thereon.
202947_14_ITEM7_P5_S2	The Company anticipates that the future development of its remaining properties in and adjacent to the Capital Center area will consist primarily of long-term ground leases.
202947_14_ITEM7_P5_S3	Pending this development, the Company leases these parcels for public parking under short-term leasing arrangements to Metropark.
202947_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	The petroleum storage segment consists of operating the petroleum storage terminal (the Terminal ) containing 1,004,000 shell barrels and the Wilkesbarre Pier (the Pier ), both of which are owned by the Company and are collectively referred to as the Facility, located in East Providence, Rhode Island.
202947_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	For the first four months of 2013, the Company operated the Facility for Global Companies, LLC ( Global ) under a lease which expired April 30, 2013.
202947_14_ITEM7_P6_S2	Effective September 1, 2013, the Company entered into a through-put lease with Atlantic Trading Marketing, Inc. ( ATMI ) for 425,000 shell barrels for a term of eight months with automatic three-month extensions unless terminated by either party.
202947_14_ITEM7_P6_S3	In addition, the Company granted ATMI a month-to-month option to lease up to 220,000 additional barrels on an as-used basis.
202947_14_ITEM7_P6_S4	Under the terms of the ATMI lease, the Company provides terminaling services related to the receipt, storage and delivery at the Terminal s loading rack to customers of ATMI s marketing agent.
202947_14_ITEM7_P6_S5	ATMI has notified the Company that it will vacate the Terminal on April 30, 2014.
202947_14_ITEM7_P6_S6	Subsequent to its notice of nonrenewal, ATMI expressed interest in negotiating an extension of its lease through April 30, 2015, at a reduced rent for the summer months.
202947_14_ITEM7_P6_S7	There is no assurance that the Company and ATMI will reach agreement on an extension.
202947_14_ITEM7_P6_S8	The Company is currently marketing the Terminal for lease to one or more petroleum storage and distribution users and is considering all its other options with respect to the Facility.
202947_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	The principal difference between the two segments relates to the nature of the operations.
202947_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	In the leasing segment, the tenants under long-term land leases incur substantially all of the development and operating costs of the assets constructed on the Company s land, including the payment of real property taxes on both the land and any improvements constructed thereon.
202947_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	In the petroleum storage segment, the Company is responsible for the operating and maintenance expenditures, as well as capital improvements at the Facility.
202947_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	Liquidity and capital resources: As a result of the issuance of Dividend Notes and the refinancing of the bank loan in late December 2012, the Company s financial position has changed significantly.
202947_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	Additionally, the expiration of the Global lease on April 30, 2013 impacted the operating cash generated by the petroleum storage segment; however, the through-put lease entered into effective September 1, 2013 with ATMI has mitigated that impact.
202947_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	In December 2012, the Company and the Bank entered into an Amended and Restated Loan Agreement pursuant to which the Company refinanced the $2,700,000 balance of the 2010 debt to the Bank and borrowed an additional $3,025,000, which was used to pay part of an extraordinary dividend of $2.25 per share to shareholders.
202947_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	The existing note to the Bank was amended and now bears interest at an annual rate of 3.34% for the first five years.
202947_14_ITEM7_P10_S2	Thereafter, the note will bear interest on either (a) a floating rate basis at LIBOR plus 215 basis points with a floor of 3.25% or (b) a fixed rate of 225 basis points over the five-year Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston Classic Advance Rate, which the Company will select at that time.
202947_14_ITEM7_P10_S3	The loan has a term of ten years with repayments on a 20-year amortization schedule (monthly payments of $24,000 plus interest) and a balloon payment of $2,869,000 in December 2022 when it matures.
202947_14_ITEM7_P10_S4	The note further contains the customary covenants, terms and conditions and permits prepayment, in whole or in part, at any time without penalty if the prepayment is made from internally generated funds.
202947_14_ITEM7_P10_S5	Parcels 3S and 5 in the Capital Center continue to serve as collateral for the loan.
202947_14_ITEM7_P10_S6	Despite the $3,025,000 increase in the bank loan, the principal and interest payments on an annual basis remain approximately the same due to a reduction in the interest rate.
202947_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	Dividend notes: On December 7, 2012, the Board of Directors of the Company declared an extraordinary dividend of $2.25 per share on its Class A and Class B common stock to shareholders of record on December 17, 2012.
202947_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	On December 27, 2012, the Company paid out $3,063,000 in cash and issued $11,787,000 in principal face amount of 5% dividend notes due December 26, 2022 (the Dividend Notes ).
202947_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	The Dividend Notes are unsecured general obligations of the Company bearing interest at the annual rate of 5% payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 to note holders of record on June 1 and December 1 of each year.
202947_14_ITEM7_P11_S3	The Dividend Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time and from time to time at the option of the Company.
202947_14_ITEM7_P11_S4	The Dividend Notes are subject to mandatory redemption in an amount equal to the Net Proceeds from the sale of any real property owned by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
202947_14_ITEM7_P11_S5	Net Proceeds means the gross cash received by the Company from any such sale reduced by the sum of (a) costs relating to the sale, (b) federal and state income taxes as a result of the sale, and (c) the amount used by the Company to pay in whole or in part financial institution debts secured by a mortgage of the Company s or any subsidiary s real property regardless of whether such mortgage encumbers the property sold.
202947_14_ITEM7_P11_S6	The Company has obligated itself not to grant any mortgages on any of its property located in the Capitol Center District in Providence, Rhode Island, other than Parcels 3S and 5, and to cause its subsidiaries not to grant any such mortgages, in each case without the consent of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding principal face amount of the Dividend Notes.
202947_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	The Dividend Notes contain other customary terms and conditions.
202947_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	The interest payments on an annual basis total $590,000.
202947_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	Petroleum storage facility: As reported in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 hereof, the Global lease expired April 30, 2013 and the Global Option Agreement terminated on June 3, 2013.
202947_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	As described above, as of September 1, 2013, ATMI leased 425,000 shell barrels for a term of eight months at a monthly rent of approximately $150,000.
202947_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	ATMI has notified the Company that it will vacate the Facility on April 30, 2014.
202947_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	its lease through April 30, 2015, at a reduced rent for the summer months.
202947_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	There is no assurance that the Company and ATMI will reach agreement on an extension.
202947_14_ITEM7_P15_S2	The Company is currently considering all of its options with respect to the Facility.
202947_14_ITEM7_P15_S3	Management cannot presently determine what revenue, if any, will be generated by the Facility after the termination of the ATMI lease.
202947_14_ITEM7_P15_S4	During 2013, the Company s operating activities provided $930,000 of cash, which was $1,750,000 less than the cash provided by operating activities in 2012, principally due to the expiration of the Global lease on April 30, 2013 and the lack of a tenant for the Terminal until September 1, 2013.
202947_14_ITEM7_P15_S5	Cash at December 31, 2013 increased $627,000 from 2012.
202947_14_ITEM7_P15_S6	During 2013, the Company did not pay a dividend and only purchased $17,000 of equipment.
202947_14_ITEM7_P15_S7	While the Facility was vacant, the Company incurred expense of approximately $75,000 per month with respect to the Facility, exclusive of severance payments and depreciation.
202947_14_ITEM7_P15_S8	On June 14, 2013, the Company severed four employees of the Facility and paid to such employees, for varying periods depending on each employee s years of service, severance consisting of salary continuation and provision of medical benefits.
202947_14_ITEM7_P15_S9	The severed employees were subject to call back should the Facility reopen.
202947_14_ITEM7_P15_S10	If an employee failed to return, he forfeited the balance of his severance payment.
202947_14_ITEM7_P15_S11	In connection with the ATMI lease, the Company called back all of its former employees and all those employees reported to work and the Company ceased paying any severance benefits.
202947_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	Historically, the Company has had adequate liquidity to fund its operations.
202947_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	Even if portions of the Facility remain unleased for an extended period of time (which the Company does not believe will be the case), the Company believes that it will have adequate liquidity from other operations to pay its expenses and other obligations, including debt service on the bank loan and the dividend notes and ordinary capital expenditures.
202947_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	Cash and cash commitments: At December 31, 2013, the Company had cash of $3,305,000.

202947_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	Under the terms of the Company s long-term land leases, appraisals of the premises are periodically required at various stated intervals to provide the basis for recalculating the annual rent.
202947_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	An appraisal of Parcel 5 was completed and, commencing April 1, 2013, the annual rent increased from $344,000 to $540,000.
202947_14_ITEM7_P20_S2	Under the terms of three additional long-term land leases, the scheduled annual contractual rent will increase in 2014 as follows: (1) on July 1, 2014, the rent on Parcel 6A will increase $30,000; (2) on July 1, 2014, the rent on 6B will increase $18,000; and (3) on October 1, 2014, the rent on Parcel 3S will increase $133,000.

202947_14_ITEM7_P21_S2	At December 31, 2013, the Company has no non-cancellable contract obligations other than one operating lease for a billboard location for which the rent expense is not material in amount.
202947_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	3. Results of operations: Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2012 Leasing segment: Leasing revenues increased due to scheduled increases in rentals under long-term land leases and increases under short-term leases.
202947_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	Leasing expense decreased principally due to a decrease in real property taxes resulting from a reassessment of the downtown Providence parcels.
202947_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	Petroleum storage segment: Petroleum storage facility revenues decreased due to the expiration of the Global lease on April 30, 2013, offset in part by revenue from the new lease with ATMI which commenced September 1, 2013, at a monthly rent of $150,000.
202947_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	Petroleum storage facility expense increased due to an increase in (1) repairs and maintenance which included the epoxy coating of three tank bottoms at a total cost of $90,000 and piping modifications at a cost of $60,000 and (2) professional fees in connection with the marketing of the terminal.
202947_14_ITEM7_P23_S2	General: For the year ended December 31, 2013, general and administrative expense decreased $113,000.

202947_14_ITEM8_P0_S7	An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
202947_14_ITEM8_P0_S8	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

202947_14_ITEM8_P6_S0	Description of business: Capital Properties, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Tri-State Displays, Inc., Capital Terminal Company and Dunellen, LLC (collectively referred to as the Company ) operate in two segments, leasing and petroleum storage.
202947_14_ITEM8_P7_S0	The leasing segment consists of the long-term leasing of certain of its real estate interests in downtown Providence, Rhode Island (upon the commencement of which the tenants are required to construct buildings thereon, with the exception of the parking garage and Parcels 6B and 6C), the leasing of a portion of its building ( Steeple Street Building ) under short-term leasing arrangements and the leasing of locations along interstate and primary highways in Rhode Island and Massachusetts to Lamar Outdoor Advertising, LLC ( Lamar ) which has constructed outdoor advertising boards thereon.
202947_14_ITEM8_P7_S1	The Company anticipates that the future development of its remaining properties in and adjacent to the Capital Center area will consist primarily of long-term ground leases.
202947_14_ITEM8_P7_S2	Pending this development, the Company leases these parcels for public parking under short-term leasing arrangements to Metropark, Ltd. ( Metropark ).
202947_14_ITEM8_P8_S0	The petroleum storage segment consists of operating the petroleum storage terminal (the Terminal ) containing 1,044,000 shell barrels and the Wilkesbarre Pier (the Pier ), both of which are owned by the Company and are collectively referred to as the Facility, located in East Providence, Rhode Island.
202947_14_ITEM8_P8_S1	For the first four months of 2013, the Company operated the Facility for Global Companies, LLC ( Global ) under a lease which expired April 30, 2013.
202947_14_ITEM8_P8_S2	Effective September 1, 2013, the Company entered into a through-put lease with Atlantic Trading Marketing, Inc. ( ATMI ) for 425,000 shell barrels for a term of eight months with automatic three-month extensions unless terminated by either party.
202947_14_ITEM8_P8_S3	In addition, the Company granted ATMI a month-to-month option to lease up to 220,000 additional barrels on an as-used basis.
202947_14_ITEM8_P8_S4	Under the terms of the ATMI lease, the Company provides terminaling services related to the receipt, storage and delivery at the Terminal s loading rack to customers of ATMI s marketing agent.
202947_14_ITEM8_P8_S5	ATMI has notified the Company that it will vacate the Facility on April 30, 2014.
202947_14_ITEM8_P8_S6	Subsequent to its notice of nonrenewal, ATMI expressed interest in negotiating an extension of its lease through April 30, 2015, at a reduced rent for the summer months.
202947_14_ITEM8_P8_S7	There is no assurance that the Company and ATMI will reach agreement on an extension.
202947_14_ITEM8_P8_S8	The Company is currently marketing the Terminal for lease and is considering all of its other options with respect to the Facility.
202947_14_ITEM8_P9_S0	The principal difference between the two segments relates to the nature of the operations.
202947_14_ITEM8_P10_S0	In the leasing segment, the tenants under long-term land leases incur substantially all of the development and operating costs of the assets constructed on the Company s land, including the payment of real property taxes on both the land and any improvements constructed thereon.
202947_14_ITEM8_P10_S1	In the petroleum storage segment, the Company is responsible for the operating and maintenance expenditures, as well as capital improvements at the Facility.
202947_14_ITEM8_P11_S0	Summary of significant accounting policies: Principles of consolidation: The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts and transactions of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
202947_14_ITEM8_P11_S1	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
202947_14_ITEM8_P12_S0	reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.
202947_14_ITEM8_P12_S1	Estimates also affect the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.
202947_14_ITEM8_P12_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
202947_14_ITEM8_P13_S0	Fair value of financial instruments: The Company believes that the fair values of its financial instruments, including cash, receivables and payables, approximate their respective book values because of their short-term nature.
202947_14_ITEM8_P13_S1	The fair value of the bank note payable approximates its book value and was determined using borrowing rates currently available to the Company for loans with similar terms and maturities.
202947_14_ITEM8_P13_S2	Based upon an opinion obtained by the Company from an investment banking firm, the fair value of the dividend notes payable approximates their book value.
202947_14_ITEM8_P13_S3	The fair values described herein were determined using significant other observable inputs (Level 2) as defined by GAAP.
202947_14_ITEM8_P14_S0	Properties and equipment: Properties and equipment are stated at cost.
202947_14_ITEM8_P14_S1	Acquisitions and additions are capitalized while routine maintenance and repairs, which do not improve the asset or extend its life, are charged to expense when incurred.
202947_14_ITEM8_P14_S2	Depreciation is being provided by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.
202947_14_ITEM8_P15_S0	The Company follows GAAP when accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, which requires that properties and equipment held and used by the Company be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value of the asset may not be recoverable.
202947_14_ITEM8_P15_S1	An impairment loss will be recognized if the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and before interest) from the use of the asset is less than the net book value of the asset.
202947_14_ITEM8_P15_S2	Generally, the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the estimated fair value of the asset.
202947_14_ITEM8_P16_S0	Cash and cash equivalents: The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
202947_14_ITEM8_P16_S1	At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had no cash equivalents.
202947_14_ITEM8_P16_S2	The Company maintains all of its cash in non-interest bearing checking accounts in one bank which were fully insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ).
202947_14_ITEM8_P16_S3	Effective January 1, 2013, the FDIC reduced the insurance on all non-interest bearing bank accounts to a maximum of $250,000.
202947_14_ITEM8_P16_S4	The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.
202947_14_ITEM8_P17_S0	Environmental incidents: The Company accrues a liability when an environmental incident has occurred and the costs are estimable.
202947_14_ITEM8_P17_S1	The Company does not record a receivable for recoveries from third parties for environmental matters until it has determined that the amount of the collection is reasonably assured.
202947_14_ITEM8_P17_S2	The accrued liability is relieved when the Company pays the liability or a third party assumes the liability.
202947_14_ITEM8_P17_S3	Upon determination that collection is reasonably assured or a third party assumes the liability, the Company records the amount as a reduction of expense.
202947_14_ITEM8_P18_S0	The Company charges to expense those costs that do not extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of the property owned or used by the Company.
202947_14_ITEM8_P19_S0	Revenues: Leasing The Company s properties leased to others are under operating leases.
202947_14_ITEM8_P19_S1	The Company reports leasing revenue when earned under the operating method.
202947_14_ITEM8_P19_S2	Certain of the Company s long-term land leases, including the outdoor advertising locations, provide for presently known scheduled rent increases over the remaining terms (32 to 140 years).
202947_14_ITEM8_P19_S3	The Company follows GAAP in accounting for leases by recognizing leasing revenue on the straight-line basis over the terms of the leases; however, the Company does not report as revenue that portion of such straight-line rentals which management is unable to conclude is realizable (collectible) due to the length of the lease terms and other related uncertainties.
202947_14_ITEM8_P20_S0	Petroleum storage facility The Company reports revenue from the operations of the Facility when earned and reports as revenue the tenant s portion of the real property taxes and certain other items as required by the lease.
202947_14_ITEM8_P20_S1	Contingent The Company reports contingent revenue in the period in which the factors occur on which the contingent payments are predicated.
202947_14_ITEM8_P21_S0	Income taxes: The Company and its subsidiaries file consolidated income tax returns.
202947_14_ITEM8_P21_S1	The Company provides for income taxes based on income reported for financial reporting purposes.
202947_14_ITEM8_P21_S2	The provision for income taxes differs from the amounts currently payable because of temporary differences associated with the recognition of certain income and expense items for financial reporting and tax reporting purposes.
202947_14_ITEM8_P21_S3	The Company follows GAAP in accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.
202947_14_ITEM8_P21_S4	Based on its evaluation, the Company has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the consolidated financial statements.
202947_14_ITEM8_P21_S5	The Company will report any tax-related interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.
202947_14_ITEM8_P22_S0	Legal fees: The Company recognizes legal fees as incurred.
202947_14_ITEM8_P23_S0	Basic earnings per common share: Basic earnings per common share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
202947_14_ITEM8_P24_S0	New accounting standards: The Company reviews new accounting standards as issued.
202947_14_ITEM8_P24_S1	Although some of these accounting standards may be applicable to the Company, the Company expects that none of the new standards will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
202947_14_ITEM8_P25_S0	Properties and equipment: Properties and equipment consist of the following:
202947_14_ITEM8_P26_S0	In April 2010, the Company borrowed $6,000,000 from a bank.

202947_14_ITEM8_P26_S3	As collateral for the loan, the Company granted the Bank a mortgage on Parcels 3S and 5 in the Capital Center.
202947_14_ITEM8_P26_S4	The proceeds of the loan were used primarily to fund a special dividend of $5,478,000 to shareholders which represented the Company s earnings and profits as calculated for federal income tax purposes at December 31, 2009.

202947_14_ITEM8_P30_S0	The following is a schedule of principal payments for the remaining term of the note payable: In connection with the 2010 borrowing, the Company incurred financing fees totaling $55,000, which were being amortized by the straight-line method, resulting in a balance of $40,000 at the date of refinancing.
202947_14_ITEM8_P30_S1	In connection with the 2012 borrowing, the Company incurred an additional $31,000 in financing fees.
202947_14_ITEM8_P30_S2	The total of $71,000 will be amortized by the straight-line method over the 10-year term of the note (which approximates the effective interest rate method).
202947_14_ITEM8_P30_S3	Amortization of deferred financing fees is included in interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
202947_14_ITEM8_P31_S0	Dividend notes: On December 27, 2012, in connection with the payment of the dividend described above, the Company issued $11,787,000 in principal face amount of 5% dividend notes due December 26, 2022 (the Dividend Notes ).

202947_14_ITEM8_P44_S0	with a calculation of Adjusted Book Value (as that term is defined in the Option Agreement) of the Facility which amounted to $19,700,000.
202947_14_ITEM8_P44_S1	Global then elected to proceed with the determination of Appraised Value (as defined in the Option Agreement).
202947_14_ITEM8_P44_S2	Global and the Company each selected an appraiser and elected to defer selection of a third appraiser until their respective appraisers completed their appraisals and discussed the results.
202947_14_ITEM8_P44_S3	The Company s appraiser arrived at an appraised value of $46,200,000 for the Facility.
202947_14_ITEM8_P44_S4	Global s appraiser arrived at a value of $15,400,000 for the Facility.
202947_14_ITEM8_P44_S5	As required by the Option Agreement, the two appraisers then engaged a third appraiser who on May 17, 2013 appraised the Facility at $35,000,000.
202947_14_ITEM8_P44_S6	Global had ten business days following the receipt of the third appraisal to elect to proceed with a feasibility study of the Facility, which it failed to do.

202947_14_ITEM8_P44_S8	Under the terms of the Option Agreement, in the event Global elected not to purchase the Facility, Global was required to reimburse the Company for the cost of the Company s appraisal, which totaled $96,000; this amount is recorded as a reduction of petroleum storage expense on the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2013.
202947_14_ITEM8_P44_S9	The payment was received in July 2013.
202947_14_ITEM8_P44_S10	On May 1, 2012, the Company gave Global notice of non-extension of the Global lease.
202947_14_ITEM8_P44_S11	Global was solely responsible for the removal of its inventory and the cleaning of the tanks prior to May 1, 2013 and the costs associated with these activities.
202947_14_ITEM8_P44_S12	The Global lease terminated on April 30, 2013, and the Company took full control of the Facility on that date.
202947_14_ITEM8_P45_S0	Prior to April 30, 2013, Global completed removal of product and the cleaning of the tanks.
202947_14_ITEM8_P45_S1	The final inspection report indicated that two tanks required repairs which were done by the Company and the costs were reimbursed by Global.
202947_14_ITEM8_P45_S2	Effective May 1, 2013, the Company became responsible for all real property taxes on the Facility, which totaled $287,000 for 2013.

202947_14_ITEM8_P45_S4	In 2013, Global paid $60,000, its proportionate share of the 2013 taxes.
202947_14_ITEM8_P45_S5	The tax reimbursements are included in petroleum storage facility revenue on the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
202947_14_ITEM8_P46_S0	As described in Note 1 above, ATMI leased 425,000 shell barrels as of September 1, 2013 at a monthly rent of approximately $150,000 and up to 220,000 additional barrels on an as-used basis.
202947_14_ITEM8_P46_S1	ATMI has notified the Company that it will vacate the Facility on April 30, 2014.
202947_14_ITEM8_P46_S2	Subsequent to its notice of nonrenewal, ATMI expressed interest in negotiating an extension of its lease through April 30, 2015, at a reduced rent for the summer months.
202947_14_ITEM8_P46_S3	There is no assurance that the Company and ATMI will reach agreement on an extension.
202947_14_ITEM8_P46_S4	The Company is currently marketing the Terminal for lease and is considering all of its other options with respect to the Facility.
202947_14_ITEM8_P47_S0	On June 14, 2013, the Company severed four employees of the Facility and paid to such employees, for varying periods depending on each employee s years of service, severance consisting of salary continuation and provision of medical benefits.
202947_14_ITEM8_P47_S1	The severed employees were subject to call back should the Facility reopen.
202947_14_ITEM8_P47_S2	If an employee failed to return, he forfeited the balance of his severance payment.
202947_14_ITEM8_P47_S3	In connection with the ATMI lease, the Company called back all of its former employees and all those employees reported to work and the Company is no longer paying any severance benefits.
202947_14_ITEM8_P48_S0	The Pier is a deep-water pier in East Providence, Rhode Island owned by the Company which is integral to the operation of the Terminal.
202947_14_ITEM8_P48_S1	The Pier and the Terminal are connected by two petroleum pipelines which the Company has a permanent right to use.
202947_14_ITEM8_P49_S0	On August 31, 2011, while excavating in connection with the construction of a highway for the Rhode Island Department of Transportation ( RIDOT ), Cardi Corporation ( Cardi ) ruptured an underground pipeline controlled and used by the Company for the transportation of ULSD from the Wilkesbarre Pier to its Petroleum Storage Facility.
202947_14_ITEM8_P50_S0	of the rupture, approximately 70,000 gallons of ULSD were discharged.
202947_14_ITEM8_P51_S0	Pursuant to the Company s Emergency Response Plan, representatives of the Company took control of the spill site and coordinated the response of various governmental agencies as well as private contractors.
202947_14_ITEM8_P51_S1	Approximately 56,000 gallons of spilled diesel were recovered.
202947_14_ITEM8_P51_S2	On September 6, 2011, the Company turned over the responsibility for the cleanup to Cardi.
202947_14_ITEM8_P51_S3	The Company notified the required government agencies and its insurance carriers of the rupture.
202947_14_ITEM8_P51_S4	Management s estimate of the total cost incurred by the Company in responding to the emergency and repairing the pipeline was $349,000, which amount was accrued as an expense at September 30, 2011, and the Company determined that no receivable could be recorded at that time.
202947_14_ITEM8_P51_S5	In November 2011, Cardi paid the Company $89,000, which amount was offset against the expense previously recorded.
202947_14_ITEM8_P51_S6	During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company paid an additional $14,000 in connection with the pipeline rupture.
202947_14_ITEM8_P51_S7	At December 31, 2011, the Company determined that $184,000 of the remaining liability was assumed by Cardi.
202947_14_ITEM8_P51_S8	The Company reduced the previously recorded liability and expense by that amount.
202947_14_ITEM8_P51_S9	In February 2012, Cardi paid the $184,000.
202947_14_ITEM8_P51_S10	In May 2012, Cardi paid the remaining $90,000.
202947_14_ITEM8_P52_S0	Environmental incident (2002): In 2002, during testing of monitoring wells at the Terminal, the Company s consulting engineer discovered free floating phase product in a groundwater monitoring well located on that portion of the Terminal purchased in 2000.
202947_14_ITEM8_P52_S1	Laboratory analysis indicated that the product was gasoline, which is not a product the Company ever stored at the Terminal.
202947_14_ITEM8_P52_S2	The Company commenced an environmental investigation and analysis, the results of which indicate that the gasoline did not come from the Terminal.
202947_14_ITEM8_P52_S3	The Company notified the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management ( RIDEM ).
202947_14_ITEM8_P52_S4	RIDEM subsequently identified Power Test Realty Partnership ( Power Test ), the owner of an adjacent parcel, as a potentially responsible party for the contamination.
202947_14_ITEM8_P52_S5	Getty Properties Corp. is the general partner of Power Test.
202947_14_ITEM8_P53_S0	Power Test challenged that determination and, after an administrative hearing, in October 2008 a RIDEM Hearing Officer determined that Power Test is responsible for the discharge of the petroleum product under the Rhode Island Oil Pollution Control Act, R.I.G.L. Section 46-12.5.1-3 and Rule 6(a) and 12(b) of the Oil Pollution Control Regulations.
202947_14_ITEM8_P53_S1	The RIDEM Decision and Order requires Power Test to remediate the contamination as directed by RIDEM and remanded the proposed penalty to RIDEM for recalculation.
202947_14_ITEM8_P53_S2	In November 2008, Power Test appealed the decision to the Rhode Island Superior Court.
202947_14_ITEM8_P53_S3	In addition, in November 2008, Power Test sought, and received, a stay of the Decision and Order of the Hearing Officer pending a clarification by RIDEM of the amount of the proposed penalty.
202947_14_ITEM8_P53_S4	In October 2009, RIDEM issued a recalculated administrative penalty, and, subsequently, the RIDEM Hearing Officer issued a recommended amended decision, which was affirmed as a final decision by the RIDEM Director in December 2009.
202947_14_ITEM8_P53_S5	In January 2010, Power Test appealed that decision to the Superior Court.
202947_14_ITEM8_P53_S6	In September 2011, the Superior Court affirmed the decision of the RIDEM director.
202947_14_ITEM8_P53_S7	Power Test has appealed that decision to the Rhode Island Supreme Court.
202947_14_ITEM8_P53_S8	The Supreme Court has not yet determined whether it will hear the appeal.
202947_14_ITEM8_P54_S0	In April 2009, the Company sued Power Test and Getty Properties Corp. in the Rhode Island Superior Court seeking remediation of the site or, in the alternative, the cost of the remediation.
202947_14_ITEM8_P54_S1	On May 1, 2009, Power Test and Getty Properties Corp. removed the action to the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island ( the Court ).
202947_14_ITEM8_P55_S0	On May 22, 2009, Power Test and Getty Properties Corp. answered the Complaint and filed a Counterclaim against Dunellen, LLC and Capital Terminal Company alleging that Dunellen, LLC and Capital Terminal Company are responsible for the contamination.
202947_14_ITEM8_P55_S1	Getty Properties Corp. and Power Test joined Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc., the tenant under a long-term lease with Getty Properties Corp. of the adjacent property, as a defendant.
202947_14_ITEM8_P55_S2	The Company amended its Complaint to add Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. as a defendant.
202947_14_ITEM8_P55_S3	Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. moved for summary judgment against the Company, Getty Properties Corp. and Power Test.
202947_14_ITEM8_P56_S0	On December 5, 2011, Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
202947_14_ITEM8_P56_S1	Thereafter, with Bankruptcy Court approval, Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. rejected its lease with Getty Properties Corp.
202947_14_ITEM8_P57_S0	On August 24, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court approved a plan to liquidate Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc.
202947_14_ITEM8_P57_S1	On January 15, 2013, the Court granted Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. s motion for summary judgment against the Company, Getty Properties Corp. and Power Test, dismissing the Company s third-party complaint.
202947_14_ITEM8_P57_S2	The parties have agreed to stay the litigation pending a determination by the Rhode Island Supreme Court on the Power Test appeal.
202947_14_ITEM8_P57_S3	There can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in this litigation.
202947_14_ITEM8_P57_S4	Since January 2003, the Company has not incurred significant costs in connection with this matter, other than ongoing litigation costs, and is unable to determine the costs it might incur to remedy the situation, as well as any costs to investigate, defend and seek reimbursement from the responsible party with respect to this contamination.
202947_14_ITEM8_P58_S0	In 1994, a leak was discovered in a 25,000 barrel storage tank at the Terminal which allowed the escape of a small amount of fuel oil.
202947_14_ITEM8_P58_S1	All required notices were made to RIDEM.
202947_14_ITEM8_P58_S2	In 2000, the tank was demolished and testing of the groundwater indicated that there was no large pooling of contaminants.
202947_14_ITEM8_P59_S0	In 2001, RIDEM approved a plan pursuant to which the Company installed a passive system consisting of three wells and commenced monitoring the wells.
202947_14_ITEM8_P59_S1	In 2003, RIDEM decided that the passive monitoring system previously approved was not sufficient and required the Company to design an active remediation system for the removal of product from the contaminated site.
202947_14_ITEM8_P59_S2	The Company and its consulting engineers began the pre-design testing of the site in the fourth quarter of 2004.
202947_14_ITEM8_P59_S3	The consulting engineers estimated a total cost of $200,000 to design, install and operate the system, which amount was accrued in 2004.
202947_14_ITEM8_P59_S4	Through 2006, the Company had expended $119,000 and has not incurred any additional costs since then.
202947_14_ITEM8_P59_S5	In 2011, RIDEM notified the company to proceed with the next phase of the approval process, notifying the abutters of the proposed remediation system even though RIDEM has not yet taken any action on the Company s proposed plan.
202947_14_ITEM8_P60_S0	As designed, the system will pump out the contaminants which will be disposed of in compliance with applicable regulations.
202947_14_ITEM8_P60_S1	After a period of time, the groundwater will be tested to determine if sufficient contaminants have been removed.
202947_14_ITEM8_P60_S2	While the Company and its consulting engineers believe that the proposed active remediation system will correct the situation, it is possible that RIDEM could require the Company to expand remediation efforts, which could result in the Company incurring costs in excess of the remaining accrual of $81,000.
202947_14_ITEM8_P61_S0	Income taxes: For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, income tax expense (benefit) is comprised of the following components:
202947_14_ITEM8_P62_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, a reconciliation of the income tax provision as computed by applying the United States income tax rate (34%) to income before income taxes is as follows: Deferred income taxes are recorded based upon differences between financial statement and tax basis amounts of assets and liabilities.
202947_14_ITEM8_P62_S1	The tax effects of temporary differences which give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows: The Company s federal and various state income tax returns for the years subsequent to 2009 remain subject to examination.
202947_14_ITEM8_P62_S2	The Company follows GAAP when reviewing all its tax positions and has determined that no reserves are required.
202947_14_ITEM8_P63_S0	In November 2008, the Company restated its Articles of Incorporation:
202947_14_ITEM8_P64_S0	To provide for certain transfer and ownership restrictions as set forth therein.
202947_14_ITEM8_P65_S0	In December 2008, the Company issued (in the form of a stock dividend) 3,299,956 shares of Class B Common Stock on a one-for-one basis for each share of Class A Common Stock held.
202947_14_ITEM8_P65_S1	The holders of Class A and Class B Common Stock voted together as a single class on all matters submitted to the shareholders of the Company except for the election of the Board of Directors and except in connection with certain major corporate actions, including a sale of the Company.
202947_14_ITEM8_P65_S2	The holders of Class A Common Stock, voting as a separate class, elected one-third of the Board of Directors.
202947_14_ITEM8_P66_S0	Class B Common Stock, voting as a separate class, elected the remainder of the Board of Directors.
202947_14_ITEM8_P66_S1	Class B Common Stock was convertible by the record owner thereof into the same number of shares of Class A Common Stock at any time.
202947_14_ITEM8_P66_S2	The Class A Common Stock is listed on the Premier QX Tier of the OTCQX.
202947_14_ITEM8_P66_S3	The Class B Common Stock was not listed on any national or regional stock exchange, or on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation National Market System or on the OTCQX.
202947_14_ITEM8_P67_S0	The holders of Class A and Class B Common Stock shared equally in the earnings of the Company and in dividends declared by the Company.
202947_14_ITEM8_P67_S1	The Company s Restated Articles of Incorporation prohibited any shareholder from acquiring more than a 5% interest in the Company s classes of common stock and prohibited any shareholder or any beneficial owner who, at the time of the filing of the Restated Articles of Incorporation owned 5% or more of the Company s classes of common stock from increasing their aggregate percentage ownership of both classes of common stock.
202947_14_ITEM8_P67_S2	If a shareholder acquired a number of shares that resulted in the limitation being exceeded, shares in excess of the limitation were automatically converted into an equal number of shares of Excess Stock, which class was authorized pursuant to the 2001 Amendment to the Company s Articles of Incorporation.
202947_14_ITEM8_P67_S3	Excess Stock was non-voting and not entitled to dividends.
202947_14_ITEM8_P67_S4	However, the shareholder could designate a qualifying transferee for shares of Excess Stock, at which time such shares would be converted and reissued as Class A or Class B Common shares as the case may be.
202947_14_ITEM8_P68_S0	The purpose for creating the Class B Common Stock was to put the Company in the position to qualify to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ).
202947_14_ITEM8_P68_S1	One of the qualifications to be taxed as a REIT is that no more than 50% of the shares of a company can be held by five or fewer individuals during the last half of each taxable year.
202947_14_ITEM8_P68_S2	Currently, the majority shareholder controls 52.3% of the Company s outstanding common stock and three other shareholders each own more than 5% of the Company s outstanding common stock.
202947_14_ITEM8_P68_S3	In order for the Company to qualify to be taxed as a REIT, the major shareholders ownership of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock would need to be reduced below the 50% level.
202947_14_ITEM8_P68_S4	In January 2013, the Board of Directors of the Company approved submitting to the shareholders at the 2013 annual meeting Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation which, among other things, eliminated (1) the Class B Common shares and automatically converted all Class B Common shares into an equivalent number of Class A Common shares, (2) all restrictions that existed with respect to the ownership of Class A and Class B Common stock and (3) Excess Stock.
202947_14_ITEM8_P68_S5	The Board took this action after concluding that conversion to a REIT was unlikely to occur at any time in the foreseeable future.
202947_14_ITEM8_P68_S6	On April 23, 2013, the shareholders approved the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation.
202947_14_ITEM8_P69_S0	On December 7, 2012, the Company s Board of Directors declared a dividend of $2.25 per share ($14,850,000) to shareholders of record as of December 17, 2012.
202947_14_ITEM8_P69_S1	For shareholders owning 100 or more shares, the dividend was payable 20%, or $.45 per share, in cash and 80%, or $1.80 per share, in Dividend Notes to be issued by the Company.
202947_14_ITEM8_P69_S2	Shareholders owning less than 100 shares of any class of Company stock where the shares were titled in their names and not held by a broker, received 100% of the dividend in cash unless they elected to receive it 20% in cash and 80% in Dividend Notes.
202947_14_ITEM8_P69_S3	The dividend was paid on December 27, 2012, at which time the Company paid out $3,063,000 in cash, and issued $11,787,000 in 5% Dividend Notes described in Note 4.
202947_14_ITEM8_P69_S4	In accordance with GAAP, at December 7, 2012, the Company s retained earnings of $3,870,000 was reduced to zero and the remaining $10,980,000 was offset against capital in excess of par.
202947_14_ITEM8_P69_S5	In connection with the declaration of the dividend, the Company s Board of Directors received a solvency opinion from an investment banking firm to the effect that the dividend would not result in the Company s liabilities exceeding its assets and would not render the Company insolvent.
202947_14_ITEM8_P70_S0	Operating segment disclosures: The Company operates in two segments: (1) Leasing and (2) Petroleum Storage.
202947_14_ITEM8_P70_S1	The Company makes decisions relative to the allocation of resources and evaluates performance based on each segment s respective income before income taxes, excluding interest expense and certain corporate expenses.
202947_14_ITEM8_P70_S2	Inter-segment revenues are immaterial in amount.
202947_14_ITEM8_P70_S3	The following financial information is used for making operating decisions and assessing performance of the Company s segments:
202947_14_ITEM8_P71_S0	The following is a reconciliation of the segment information to the amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements:
202947_14_ITEM8_P72_S0	The following table sets forth those customers whose revenues exceed 10 percent of the Company s segment revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012:
202947_14_ITEM8_P73_S0	Related party transaction: The Company and Providence and Worcester Railroad Company ( the Railroad ) have a common controlling shareholder.
202947_14_ITEM8_P74_S0	The Company has the right to use certain pipelines located in the right of way of the Railroad which were constructed by Getty Oil Company (Eastern Operations), Inc. ( GettyEO ).
202947_14_ITEM8_P74_S1	Pursuant to an agreement between the Railroad and GettyEO dated August 6, 1975, the Railroad has the right to relocate any portion of the pipelines located within the Railroad s right of way.
202947_14_ITEM8_P75_S0	The Company supported the extension of Waterfront Drive, so-called, up to Dexter Road and adjacent to the Company s Terminal, which road was constructed on the Railroad right of way.
202947_14_ITEM8_P75_S1	The road was completed in November 2012.
202947_14_ITEM8_P76_S0	The State of Rhode Island s plans for the Waterfront Drive extension required a relocation of a portion of the pipelines which the Railroad had the right to relocate.
202947_14_ITEM8_P76_S1	RIDOT entered into an agreement with the Railroad (the RIDOT Agreement ) to reimburse the Railroad for reasonable costs incurred by it in relocating the pipelines, which were originally estimated to be $159,000.

202947_15_ITEM1_P15_S1	The Terminal utilizes the Pier and pipelines connecting the Pier to the Terminal.
202947_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	Global Lease For the period May 1, 1998 to April 30, 2013, the Company leased the Facility to Global Companies, LLC ( Global ) for the storage and sale of petroleum distillates and operated the Facility for Global pursuant to a contract with another Company subsidiary, Capital Terminal Company.
202947_15_ITEM1_P16_S1	The Company was responsible for labor, insurance, a portion of the real property taxes and other operating expenses, as well as certain capital improvements.
202947_15_ITEM1_P16_S2	Additionally, Global had the option to purchase the Facility.
202947_15_ITEM1_P16_S3	On April 27, 2012, Global preliminarily exercised the option.
202947_15_ITEM1_P16_S4	The option terminated on June 3, 2013 when Global withdrew its preliminary exercise as a result of failure to reach agreement with the Company on the purchase price.
202947_15_ITEM1_P16_S5	On May 1, 2012, the Company gave Global notice of non-extension of the Global lease.
202947_15_ITEM1_P16_S6	Global was solely responsible for the removal of its inventory and the cleaning of the tanks prior to May 1, 2013 and the costs associated with these activities.
202947_15_ITEM1_P16_S7	The Global lease terminated on April 30, 2013, and the Company took full control of the Facility on that date.
202947_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	Prior to April 30, 2013, Global completed the removal of product and the cleaning of the tanks.
202947_15_ITEM1_P17_S1	The final inspection report indicated that two tanks required repairs, which repairs were done by the Company and the costs reimbursed by Global.
202947_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	Effective September 1, 2013, the Company entered into a throughput lease with Atlantic Trading Marketing, Inc. ( ATMI ) for 425,000 shell barrels for a term of eight months with automatic three-month extensions unless terminated by either party.
202947_15_ITEM1_P18_S1	In addition, the Company granted ATMI a month-to-month option to lease up to 220,000 additional barrels on an as-used basis.
202947_15_ITEM1_P18_S2	Under the terms of the ATMI lease, the Company provided terminaling services related to the receipt, storage and delivery at the Terminal s loading rack to customers of ATMI s marketing agent.
202947_15_ITEM1_P18_S3	ATMI vacated the Facility on April 30, 2014.
202947_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	Sprague Petroleum Storage Services Agreement Effective May 1, 2014, the Company entered into a Petroleum Storage Services Agreement (the Agreement ) with Sprague Operating Resources, LLC ( Sprague ) for the lease of its entire storage capacity of 1,004,000 barrels for a term of five years.
202947_15_ITEM1_P19_S1	The base rent is $3,500,000, subject to annual cost-of-living adjustments on May 1 of each year.
202947_15_ITEM1_P19_S2	In addition, the Company will receive an additional $.15 for each barrel of throughput at the Facility in excess of 3,500,000 barrels in any contract year (May 1 to April 30).
202947_15_ITEM1_P19_S3	Sprague has the right to extend the Agreement for two additional terms of five years each, provided that Sprague gives at least twelve months notice prior to the expiration of the initial or the extension term, as applicable.
202947_15_ITEM1_P19_S4	Commencing April 1, 2016 and on each April 1 thereafter during the initial term and any extension term, either party during the following thirty days has the right to terminate the Agreement as of April 30 of the year next following the year in which notice of termination is given.
202947_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	Commencing May 1, 2015, Sprague will reimburse the Company for any real property taxes in excess of $290,000.
202947_15_ITEM1_P20_S1	The Agreement contains other customary terms and conditions.
202947_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	The operation of a petroleum storage facility carries with it the risk of environmental contamination.
202947_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	Environmental incident (2002): In 2002, during testing of monitoring wells at the Terminal, the Company s consulting engineer discovered free floating phase product in a groundwater monitoring well located on that portion of the Terminal purchased in 2000.
202947_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	The Company commenced an environmental investigation and analysis, the results of which indicate that the gasoline did not come from the Terminal.
202947_15_ITEM1_P23_S1	The Company notified the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management ( RIDEM ).
202947_15_ITEM1_P23_S2	RIDEM subsequently identified Power Test Realty Partnership ( Power Test ), the owner of an adjacent parcel, as a potentially responsible party for the contamination.
202947_15_ITEM1_P23_S3	Getty Properties Corp. is the general partner of Power Test.
202947_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	Power Test challenged that determination and, after an administrative hearing, in October 2008 a RIDEM Hearing Officer determined that Power Test is responsible for the discharge of the petroleum product under the Rhode Island Oil Pollution Control Act, R.I.G.L. Section 46-12.5.1-3 and Rule 6(a) and 12(b) of the Oil Pollution Control Regulations.
202947_15_ITEM1_P24_S1	The RIDEM Decision and Order requires Power Test to remediate the contamination as directed by RIDEM and remanded the proposed penalty to RIDEM for recalculation.
202947_15_ITEM1_P24_S2	In November 2008, Power Test appealed the decision to the Rhode Island Superior Court.
202947_15_ITEM1_P24_S3	In addition, in November 2008, Power Test sought, and received, a stay of the Decision and Order of the Hearing Officer pending a clarification by RIDEM of the amount of the proposed penalty.
202947_15_ITEM1_P24_S4	In October 2009, RIDEM issued a recalculated administrative penalty, and, subsequently, the RIDEM Hearing Officer issued a recommended amended decision, which was affirmed as a final decision by the RIDEM Director in December 2009.
202947_15_ITEM1_P24_S5	In January 2010, Power Test appealed that decision to Superior Court.
202947_15_ITEM1_P24_S6	In September 2011, the Superior Court affirmed the decision of the RIDEM director.
202947_15_ITEM1_P24_S7	Power Test has appealed that decision to the Rhode Island Supreme Court.
202947_15_ITEM1_P24_S8	The Supreme Court has not yet decided the appeal.
202947_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	In April 2009, the Company sued Power Test and Getty Properties Corp. in the Rhode Island Superior Court seeking remediation of the site or, in the alternative, the cost of the remediation.
202947_15_ITEM1_P25_S1	On May 1, 2009, Power Test and Getty Properties Corp. removed the action to the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island ( the Court ).
202947_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	On May 22, 2009, Power Test and Getty Properties Corp. answered the Complaint and filed a Counterclaim against Dunellen, LLC and Capital Terminal Company alleging that Dunellen, LLC and Capital Terminal Company are responsible for the contamination.
202947_15_ITEM1_P26_S1	Getty Properties Corp. and Power Test joined Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc., the tenant under a long-term lease with Getty Properties Corp. of the adjacent property, as a defendant.
202947_15_ITEM1_P26_S2	The Company amended its Complaint to add Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. as a defendant.
202947_15_ITEM1_P26_S3	Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. moved for summary judgment against the Company, Getty Properties Corp. and Power Test.
202947_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	On December 5, 2011, Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
202947_15_ITEM1_P27_S1	Thereafter, with Bankruptcy Court approval, Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. rejected its lease with Getty Properties Corp.
202947_15_ITEM1_P27_S2	On August 24, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court approved a plan to liquidate Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc.
202947_15_ITEM1_P27_S3	On January 15, 2013, the Court granted Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. s motion for summary judgment against the Company, Getty Properties Corp. and Power Test, dismissing the Company s third-party complaint.
202947_15_ITEM1_P27_S4	The parties have agreed to stay the litigation pending a determination by the Rhode Island Supreme Court on the Power Test appeal.
202947_15_ITEM1_P27_S5	There can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in this litigation.
202947_15_ITEM1_P27_S6	Since January 2003, the Company has not incurred significant costs in connection with this matter, other than ongoing litigation costs, and is unable to determine the costs it might incur to remedy the situation, as well as any costs to investigate, defend and seek reimbursement from the responsible party with respect to this contamination.
202947_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	In 1994, a leak was discovered in a 25,000 barrel storage tank at the Terminal which allowed the escape of a small amount of fuel oil.
202947_15_ITEM1_P28_S1	All required notices were made to RIDEM.
202947_15_ITEM1_P28_S2	In 2000, the tank was demolished and testing of the groundwater indicated that there was no large pooling of contaminants.
202947_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	In 2001, RIDEM approved a plan pursuant to which the Company installed a passive system consisting of three wells and commenced monitoring the wells.
202947_15_ITEM1_P29_S1	In 2003, RIDEM decided that the passive monitoring system previously approved was not sufficient and required the Company to design an active remediation system for the removal of product from the contaminated site.
202947_15_ITEM1_P29_S2	The Company and its consulting engineers began the pre-design testing of the site in the fourth quarter of 2004.
202947_15_ITEM1_P29_S3	The consulting engineers estimated a total cost of $200,000 to design, install and operate the system, which amount was accrued in 2004.
202947_15_ITEM1_P29_S4	Through 2006, the Company had expended $119,000 and has not incurred any significant costs since then.
202947_15_ITEM1_P29_S5	In 2011, RIDEM notified the Company to proceed with the next phase of the approval process, notifying the abutters of the proposed remediation system even though RIDEM has not yet taken any action on the Company s proposed plan.
202947_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	As designed, the system will pump out the contaminants which will be disposed of in compliance with applicable regulations.
202947_15_ITEM1_P30_S1	After a period of time, the groundwater will be tested to determine if sufficient contaminants have been removed.
202947_15_ITEM1_P30_S2	In 2014, the Company engaged new consultants to work with RIDEM to develop the next phase of the approval process.
202947_15_ITEM1_P30_S3	While the Company and its consulting engineers believe that the proposed active remediation system will correct the situation, it is possible that RIDEM could require the Company to expand remediation efforts, which could result in the Company incurring costs in excess of the remaining accrual of $80,000.
202947_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	The Company manages its exposure to contamination, remediation or similar costs associated with the Facility through adherence to established procedures for operations and equipment maintenance.
202947_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	Insurance The Company maintains what management believes to be adequate levels of insurance, including environmental insurance.
202947_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	Competition The Facility competes with several other similar facilities located on and adjacent to the Providence Harbor.
202947_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	The Terminal has approximately 48% of the total distillate storage capacity in the Providence area.
202947_15_ITEM1_P34_S1	The current tenant, Sprague, competes with other terminal operators on the basis of price, availability and a willingness to advance credit to local wholesalers.
202947_15_ITEM1_P34_S2	The amount of petroleum throughput at the Terminal is a function of Sprague s ability to compete effectively in the marketplace and the amount of product Sprague sells at its City of Providence terminal.
202947_15_ITEM1_P34_S3	The Terminal employs eight people on a full-time basis.
202947_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	owns approximately 18 acres and a historic building in and adjacent to the Capital Center District in Providence, Rhode Island.
202947_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	All of the property and a portion of the building are leased either under long-term leases or short-term leases as more particularly described in Item 1, Leasing Segment.
202947_15_ITEM2_P0_S2	The Company also owns or controls 23 locations on which 44 billboard faces have been constructed.
202947_15_ITEM2_P0_S3	All but one these locations are owned by the Company under permanent easements from a related company, the Railroad; the remaining location is leased from an unrelated third party with a remaining term of six months; the Company is currently negotiating an extension of this lease for an additional five years.
202947_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	The Company owns an approximate 10-acre site in East Providence, Rhode Island on which there are located nine petroleum storage tanks and related distribution racks together with a 3,000 square foot single-story office building which houses the Company s headquarters and other support operations.
202947_15_ITEM2_P1_S1	In 2006, the Company completed the development of the land currently owned by the Company at the Terminal.
202947_15_ITEM2_P1_S2	In addition, the Company is the owner of the Pier located in East Providence, Rhode Island.
202947_15_ITEM2_P1_S3	The Pier, which has a deep water draft capacity of -40 feet Mean Low Water, can accommodate ships up to 825 feet in length.
202947_15_ITEM2_P1_S4	The Company has a permanent right to use the pipelines connecting the Pier to the Terminal.
202947_15_ITEM5_P0_S0	during the quarterly periods indicated as obtained from the OTCQX, together with cash dividends paid per share during such periods.
202947_15_ITEM5_P1_S0	In January 2013, the Board of Directors of the Company approved submitting to the shareholders at the 2013 annual meeting Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation which, among other things, eliminated (1) the Class B Common shares and automatically converted all Class B Common shares into an equivalent number of Class A Common shares, (2) all restrictions that existed with respect to the ownership of Class A and Class B Common stock and (3) Excess Stock.
202947_15_ITEM5_P1_S1	In April 2013, the shareholders approved the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation.
202947_15_ITEM5_P2_S0	Information with respect to the high and low trading prices for the Class B Common Stock was not available because the stock was not listed on any exchange, was not quoted by any quotation service, and there was no known market for such Class B Common Stock.
202947_15_ITEM5_P2_S1	At March 2, 2015, there were 461 holders of record of the Company s Class A Common Stock.
202947_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	Critical accounting policies: The Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) has issued guidance for the disclosure of critical accounting policies.
202947_15_ITEM7_P0_S1	The SEC defines such policies as those that require application of management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.
202947_15_ITEM7_P0_S2	The Company s significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
202947_15_ITEM7_P0_S3	Not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates.
202947_15_ITEM7_P0_S4	Management believes that the Company s revenue recognition policy for long-term leases with scheduled rent increases (leasing segment) meets the SEC definition of critical.
202947_15_ITEM7_P0_S5	Certain of the Company s long-term land leases have original terms of 30 to 149 years and contain scheduled rent increases where the future dollar increases are known at the time of the commencement of the lease or at a subsequent date.
202947_15_ITEM7_P0_S6	The first such lease commenced in 1988, had an original term of 99 years and provides for fixed percentage increases at specified intervals (as well as reappraisal increases).
202947_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	In accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) in accounting for leases, rental income related to the fixed percentage increases that are presently known should be recognized on a straight-line basis.
202947_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	To calculate the annual straight-line amount, the 99 known annual rental amounts are totaled and this total is divided by 99.
202947_15_ITEM7_P1_S2	In 2009, a scheduled appraisal occurred, resulting in a rental increase.
202947_15_ITEM7_P1_S3	The Company recalculated the future annual straight-line amount using the remaining years under the lease.
202947_15_ITEM7_P1_S4	The turnaround date discussed below did not change.
202947_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	For this lease, the calculated annual straight-line amount for 1988 was eight times (multiple) the amount paid by the tenant under the terms of the lease (the contractual amount ).
202947_15_ITEM7_P2_S1	In subsequent years, as the tenant pays higher rents, the multiple gradually decreases until the 57 th year of the lease, at which time the contractual amount paid by the tenant will exceed the calculated straight-line amount.
202947_15_ITEM7_P2_S2	If the Company were to report annual revenue for this lease using the straight-line amount, it would record a significant receivable for each of the first 56 years, which receivable would grow to approximately $34,000,000.
202947_15_ITEM7_P2_S3	Management does not believe that the Company should record a receivable that would not begin to be collected until the 56 th year (the turnaround date ) since management could not be assured of collection.
202947_15_ITEM7_P2_S4	In 1988, management met with the SEC accounting staff to discuss its concerns in applying GAAP as it related to a lease of this length which results in the recording of such a significant receivable that would remain on the Company s balance sheet and continue to grow on an annual basis with a turnaround date so far in the future.
202947_15_ITEM7_P2_S5	The Company presented the SEC accounting staff with an application of the accounting policy whereby management would evaluate the collectibility of the receivable on an annual basis and report as leasing revenue only that portion of the receivable that management could presently conclude would be collectible.
202947_15_ITEM7_P2_S6	The SEC accounting staff did not object to this application by the Company.
202947_15_ITEM7_P2_S7	Through December 31, 2014, the receivable on this lease has grown to $22,131,000 (cumulative excess of straight-line over contractual rentals) and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround date is still 31 years away.
202947_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	In 2004, a second such lease commenced with an original term of 149 years and provides for fixed minimum percentage increases at specified intervals (as well as reappraisal increases).
202947_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	For this lease, the contractual amount paid by the tenant will not exceed the calculated straight-line amount until the 94 th year of the lease.
202947_15_ITEM7_P3_S2	Through December 31, 2014, the receivable on this lease is $24,536,000 (cumulative excess of straight-line over contractual rentals) and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround date is 83 years away.
202947_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	In 2006, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Agreement of its lease with Lamar Outdoor Advertising LLC ( Lamar ).
202947_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	In 2013, the lease was extended to 2045 following the conversion of billboards at two locations to electronic boards, as required by the lease, resulting in a current remaining term of 31 years which provides for fixed percentage increases annually.
202947_15_ITEM7_P4_S2	For this lease, the contractual amount paid by Lamar will not exceed the calculated straight-line amount until the 23rd year of the extended lease.
202947_15_ITEM7_P4_S3	Through December 31, 2014, the receivable on this lease is $1,859,000 (cumulative excess of straight-line over contractual rentals) and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround date is 15 years away.
202947_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	Accordingly, the Company has not reported any portion of these amounts as leasing revenue in its consolidated financial statements and does not anticipate that it can reach such a conclusion until the turnaround dates are closer.
202947_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	Although the Company s other long-term land leases provide for scheduled rent increases, the provisions of the leases are such that certain future dollar amounts could not be calculated either at the time of the commencement of the lease or now, as such amounts are based on factors that are not presently known, i.e., future cost-of-living adjustments or future appraised values.
202947_15_ITEM7_P5_S2	Through December 31, 2014, the receivable on these leases is $13,425,000 and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround dates are approximately 46 years away.
202947_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	Segments: The Company operates in two segments: leasing and petroleum storage.
202947_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	The leasing segment consists of the long-term leasing of certain of its real estate interests in downtown Providence, Rhode Island (upon the commencement of which the tenants have been required to construct buildings thereon, with the exception of the parking garage and Parcels 6B and 6C), the leasing of a portion of the Steeple Street Building under short-term leasing arrangements and the leasing of locations along interstate and primary highways in Rhode Island and Massachusetts to Lamar which has constructed outdoor advertising boards thereon.
202947_15_ITEM7_P6_S2	The Company anticipates that the future development of its remaining properties in and adjacent to the Capital Center area will consist primarily of long-term ground leases.
202947_15_ITEM7_P6_S3	Pending this development, the Company leases these parcels for public parking under short-term leasing arrangements to Metropark.
202947_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	The petroleum storage segment consists of operating the petroleum storage terminal (the Terminal ) containing 1,004,000 shell barrels and the Wilkesbarre Pier (the Pier ), both of which are owned by the Company and are collectively referred to as the Facility, located in East Providence, Rhode Island.
202947_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	For the first four months of 2013, the Company operated the Facility for Global Companies, LLC ( Global ) under a lease which expired April 30, 2013.
202947_15_ITEM7_P7_S2	Effective September 1, 2013, the Company entered into a throughput lease with Atlantic Trading Marketing, Inc. ( ATMI ) for 425,000 shell barrels for a term of eight months with automatic three-month extensions unless terminated by either party.
202947_15_ITEM7_P7_S3	In addition, the Company granted ATMI a month-to-month option to lease up to 220,000 additional barrels on an as-used basis.
202947_15_ITEM7_P7_S4	Under the terms of the ATMI lease, the Company provided terminaling services related to the receipt, storage and delivery at the Terminal s loading rack to customers of ATMI s marketing agent.
202947_15_ITEM7_P7_S5	ATMI vacated the Facility on April 30, 2014.
202947_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	Effective May 1, 2014, the Company entered into a Petroleum Storage Services Agreement (the Agreement ) with Sprague Operating Resources, LLC ( Sprague ) for the lease of its entire storage capacity of 1,004,000 barrels for a term of five years.
202947_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	The base rent is $3,500,000, subject to annual cost-of-living adjustments on May 1 of each year.
202947_15_ITEM7_P8_S2	In addition, the Company will receive an additional $.15 for each barrel of throughput at the Facility in excess of 3,500,000 barrels in any contract year (May 1 to April 30).
202947_15_ITEM7_P8_S3	Sprague has the right to extend the Agreement for two additional terms of five years each, provided that Sprague gives at least twelve months notice prior to the expiration of the initial or the extension term, as applicable.
202947_15_ITEM7_P8_S4	Commencing April 1, 2016 and on each April 1 thereafter during the initial term and any extension term, either party during the following thirty days has the right to terminate the Agreement as of April 30 of the year next following the year in which notice of termination is given.
202947_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	Commencing May 1, 2015, Sprague will reimburse the Company for any real property taxes in excess of $290,000.
202947_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	The Agreement contains other customary terms and conditions.
202947_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	The principal difference between the two segments relates to the nature of the operations.
202947_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	In the leasing segment, the tenants under long-term land leases incur substantially all of the development and operating costs of the assets constructed on the Company s land, including the payment of real property taxes on both the land and any improvements constructed thereon.
202947_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	In the petroleum storage segment, the Company is responsible for the operating and maintenance expenditures, as well as capital improvements at the Facility.
202947_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	Liquidity and capital resources: As a result of the issuance of Dividend Notes and the refinancing of the bank loan in late December 2012, the Company s financial position has changed significantly.
202947_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	Additionally, the expiration of the Global lease on April 30, 2013 impacted the operating cash generated by the petroleum storage segment; however, the impact was mitigated by the eight-month throughput lease with ATMI which terminated April 30, 2014 and the new agreement with Sprague which commenced May 1, 2014.

202947_15_ITEM7_P14_S4	The Dividend Notes are subject to mandatory redemption in an amount equal to the Net Proceeds from the sale of any real property owned by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

202947_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	The interest payments on an annual basis total $589,000.
202947_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	Petroleum storage facility: As reported in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 hereof, the Global lease expired April 30, 2013 and the Global Option Agreement terminated on June 3, 2013.
202947_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	As described above, as of September 1, 2013, ATMI leased 425,000 shell barrels for a term of eight months at a monthly rent of approximately $150,000.

202947_15_ITEM7_P17_S2	Effective May 1, 2014, the Company entered an Agreement with Sprague for the lease of its entire storage capacity of 1,004,000 barrels for a term of five years.

202947_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	During 2014, the Company s operating activities provided $2,330,000 of cash, which was $1,400,000 more than the cash provided by operating activities in 2013.
202947_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	The increase in cash flows from operations was principally due to the commencement of the Sprague lease on May 1, 2014 and the fact that the Company had overpaid its 2013 estimated federal and state income taxes, which overpayments were applied to its 2014 income taxes, thereby requiring lower estimated payments in 2014.
202947_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2014 decreased $378,000 from 2013 mainly due to the additional principal prepayments during 2014 on the bank loan totaling $2,300,000.
202947_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	Historically, the Company has had adequate liquidity to fund its operations.
202947_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	Cash and cash commitments: At December 31, 2014, the Company had cash of $2,927,000.

202947_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	In connection with the December 2012 Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, the Company is required to maintain unencumbered liquid assets (cash and marketable securities) of $1,000,000 at the Bank.

On July 1, 2015, the rent commences on Parcel 6C at the annual rate of $200,000.
202947_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	At December 31, 2014, the Company has three tenants occupying 65 percent of the Steeple Street Building under short-term leases (five years or less) at a current total annual rental of $140,000.

202947_15_ITEM7_P24_S3	Further prepayments will depend on the Company s level of available cash.
202947_15_ITEM7_P24_S4	In light of the extraordinary dividend paid in December 2012, at each of the quarterly Board meetings held in 2014, the Board of Directors voted to omit the regular quarterly dividend of $0.03 per share.
202947_15_ITEM7_P24_S5	The Board will review the declaration of future dividends on a quarterly basis.
202947_15_ITEM7_P24_S6	The declaration of future dividends will depend on future earnings and financial performance.
202947_15_ITEM7_P24_S7	At December 31, 2014, the Company has no non-cancellable contract obligations other than one operating lease for a billboard location for which the rent expense is not material in amount.
202947_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	3. Results of operations: Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013 Leasing segment: Leasing revenues increased due to scheduled increases in rentals under long-term land leases, increases under short-term leases and an increase in percentage rent under the Lamar lease.
202947_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	Leasing expense increased due to an increase in repairs and maintenance offset in part by the decrease in rent expense resulting from the cancellation in 2013 of a third-party lease in connection with a billboard easement.
202947_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	Petroleum storage facility revenues increased in 2014.
202947_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	The Global lease expired on April 30, 2013.
202947_15_ITEM7_P26_S2	From September 1, 2013 to April 30, 2014, the Company had an interim lease with ATMI for a portion of the storage capacity of the Facility.
202947_15_ITEM7_P26_S3	Effective May 1, 2014, the Company entered into a five-year agreement with Sprague for the lease of its entire storage capacity of the Facility.
202947_15_ITEM7_P26_S4	In June 2013, the Company received $96,000 from Global for reimbursement for costs incurred in a prior year in connection with the appraisal of the Facility in connection with the Global option (see Note 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements herein).
202947_15_ITEM7_P26_S5	Exclusive of this amount, petroleum storage facility expense decreased $130,000 due to the following: (1) repairs and maintenance expense decreased because in 2013 the Company incurred costs of $90,000 to epoxy coat three tank bottoms and $60,000 for piping modifications and no similar repairs were undertaken in 2014; and (2) a decrease in professional fees.
202947_15_ITEM7_P26_S6	General: For the year ended December 31, 2014, general and administrative expense decreased $31,000 due to lower costs for professional fees, offset in part by an increase in medical claims and an increase in the maximum level allowed under the Company s medical reimbursement plan.
202947_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	Interest expense: For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, interest expense, bank loan is $164,000 and $197,000, respectively.
202947_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	In June and December 2014, the Company made principal prepayments of $1,000,000 and $1,300,000, respectively, thereby reducing the interest expense.
202947_15_ITEM7_P27_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the interest expense on the dividend notes is $589,000 and $596,000, respectively.
202947_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	Income taxes: For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company s effective income tax rate is approximately 40 percent.

202947_15_ITEM8_P0_S7	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
202947_15_ITEM8_P0_S8	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
202947_15_ITEM8_P1_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

202947_15_ITEM8_P6_S0	Description of business: Capital Properties, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Tri-State Displays, Inc., Capital Terminal Company and Dunellen, LLC (collectively referred to as the Company ) operate in two segments, leasing and petroleum storage.
202947_15_ITEM8_P7_S0	The leasing segment consists of the long-term leasing of certain of its real estate interests in downtown Providence, Rhode Island (upon the commencement of which the tenants are required to construct buildings thereon, with the exception of the parking garage and Parcels 6B and 6C), the leasing of a portion of its building ( Steeple Street Building ) under short-term leasing arrangements and the leasing of locations along interstate and primary highways in Rhode Island and Massachusetts to Lamar Outdoor Advertising, LLC ( Lamar ) which has constructed outdoor advertising boards thereon.
202947_15_ITEM8_P7_S1	The Company anticipates that the future development of its remaining properties in and adjacent to the Capital Center area will consist primarily of long-term ground leases.
202947_15_ITEM8_P7_S2	Pending this development, the Company leases these parcels for public parking under short-term leasing arrangements to Metropark, Ltd. ( Metropark ).
202947_15_ITEM8_P8_S0	The petroleum storage segment consists of the petroleum storage terminal (the Terminal ) containing 1,004,000 shell barrels and the Wilkesbarre Pier (the Pier ), both of which are owned by the Company and are collectively referred to as the Facility, located in East Providence, Rhode Island.
202947_15_ITEM8_P8_S1	For the first four months of 2013, the Company operated the Facility for Global Companies, LLC ( Global ) under a lease which expired April 30, 2013.
202947_15_ITEM8_P8_S2	Effective September 1, 2013, the Company entered into a throughput lease with Atlantic Trading Marketing, Inc. ( ATMI ) for 425,000 shell barrels for a term of eight months with automatic three-month extensions unless terminated by either party.
202947_15_ITEM8_P8_S3	In addition, the Company granted ATMI a month-to-month option to lease up to 220,000 additional barrels on an as-used basis.
202947_15_ITEM8_P8_S4	ATMI vacated the Facility on April 30, 2014.
202947_15_ITEM8_P9_S0	Effective May 1, 2014, the Company entered into a Petroleum Storage Services Agreement (the Agreement ) with Sprague Operating Resources, LLC ( Sprague ) for the lease of its entire storage capacity of 1,004,000 barrels for a term of five years.
202947_15_ITEM8_P9_S1	The base rent is $3,500,000, subject to annual cost-of-living adjustments on May 1 of each year.
202947_15_ITEM8_P9_S2	In addition, the Company will receive an additional $.15 for each barrel of throughput at the Facility in excess of 3,500,000 barrels in any contract year (May 1 to April 30).
202947_15_ITEM8_P9_S3	Sprague has the right to extend the Agreement for two additional terms of five years each, provided that Sprague gives at least twelve months notice prior to the expiration of the initial or the extension term, as applicable.
202947_15_ITEM8_P9_S4	Commencing April 1, 2016 and on each April 1 thereafter during the initial term and any extension term, either party during the following thirty days has the right to terminate the Agreement as of April 30 of the year next following the year in which notice of termination is given.
202947_15_ITEM8_P10_S0	Commencing May 1, 2015, Sprague will reimburse the Company for any real property taxes in excess of $290,000.
202947_15_ITEM8_P10_S1	The Agreement contains other customary terms and conditions.
202947_15_ITEM8_P11_S0	The principal difference between the two segments relates to the nature of the operations.
202947_15_ITEM8_P12_S0	In the leasing segment, the tenants under long-term land leases incur substantially all of the development and operating costs of the assets constructed on the Company s land, including the payment of real property taxes on both the land and any improvements constructed thereon.
202947_15_ITEM8_P12_S1	In the petroleum storage segment, the Company is responsible for the operating and maintenance expenditures, as well as capital improvements at the Facility.
202947_15_ITEM8_P13_S0	Summary of significant accounting policies: Principles of consolidation: The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts and transactions of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
202947_15_ITEM8_P13_S1	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
202947_15_ITEM8_P14_S0	Use of estimates: The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.
202947_15_ITEM8_P14_S1	Estimates also affect the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.
202947_15_ITEM8_P14_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
202947_15_ITEM8_P15_S0	Fair value of financial instruments: The Company believes that the fair values of its financial instruments, including cash, receivables and payables, approximate their respective book values because of their short-term nature.
202947_15_ITEM8_P15_S1	The fair value of the bank note payable approximates its book value and was determined using borrowing rates currently available to the Company for loans with similar terms and maturities.
202947_15_ITEM8_P15_S2	Based upon an opinion obtained by the Company from an investment banking firm, the fair value of the dividend notes payable approximates their book value.
202947_15_ITEM8_P15_S3	The fair values described herein were determined using significant other observable inputs (Level 2) as defined by GAAP.
202947_15_ITEM8_P16_S0	Properties and equipment: Properties and equipment are stated at cost.
202947_15_ITEM8_P16_S1	Acquisitions and additions are capitalized while routine maintenance and repairs, which do not improve the asset or extend its life, are charged to expense when incurred.
202947_15_ITEM8_P16_S2	Depreciation is being provided by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.
202947_15_ITEM8_P17_S0	The Company follows GAAP when accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, which requires that properties and equipment held and used by the Company be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value of the asset may not be recoverable.
202947_15_ITEM8_P17_S1	An impairment loss will be recognized if the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and before interest) from the use of the asset is less than the net book value of the asset.
202947_15_ITEM8_P17_S2	Generally, the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the estimated fair value of the asset.
202947_15_ITEM8_P18_S0	Cash and cash equivalents: The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
202947_15_ITEM8_P18_S1	At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had no cash equivalents.
202947_15_ITEM8_P18_S2	The Company had maintained all of its cash in non-interest bearing checking accounts in one bank which were fully insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ).
202947_15_ITEM8_P18_S3	Effective January 1, 2013, the FDIC reduced the insurance on all bank accounts to a maximum of $250,000.
202947_15_ITEM8_P18_S4	The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.
202947_15_ITEM8_P19_S0	Initial direct agreement costs: Initial direct agreement costs associated with the execution of a rental agreement are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable portion of the agreement term.
202947_15_ITEM8_P20_S0	Environmental incidents: The Company accrues a liability when an environmental incident has occurred and the costs are estimable.
202947_15_ITEM8_P20_S1	The Company does not record a receivable for recoveries from third parties for environmental matters until it has determined that the amount of the collection is reasonably assured.
202947_15_ITEM8_P20_S2	The accrued liability is relieved when the Company pays the liability or a third party assumes the liability.
202947_15_ITEM8_P20_S3	Upon determination that collection is reasonably assured or a third party assumes the liability, the Company records the amount as a reduction of expense.
202947_15_ITEM8_P21_S0	The Company charges to expense those costs that do not extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of the property owned or used by the Company.
202947_15_ITEM8_P22_S0	Revenues: Leasing The Company s properties leased to others are under operating leases.
202947_15_ITEM8_P22_S1	The Company reports leasing revenue when earned under the operating method.
202947_15_ITEM8_P22_S2	Certain of the Company s long-term land leases, including the outdoor advertising locations, provide for presently known scheduled rent increases over the remaining terms (31 to 139 years).
202947_15_ITEM8_P22_S3	The Company follows GAAP in accounting for leases by recognizing leasing revenue on the straight-line basis over the terms of the leases; however, the Company does not report as revenue that portion of such straight-line rentals which management is unable to conclude is realizable (collectible) due to the length of the lease terms and other related uncertainties.
202947_15_ITEM8_P23_S0	Petroleum storage facility The Company reports revenue from the operations of the Facility when earned and reports as revenue the tenant s portion of the real property taxes and certain other items as required by the lease.
202947_15_ITEM8_P23_S1	Contingent The Company reports contingent revenue in the period in which the factors occur on which the contingent payments are predicated.
202947_15_ITEM8_P24_S0	Income taxes: The Company and its subsidiaries file consolidated income tax returns.
202947_15_ITEM8_P24_S1	The Company provides for income taxes based on income reported for financial reporting purposes.
202947_15_ITEM8_P24_S2	The provision for income taxes differs from the amounts currently payable because of temporary differences associated with the recognition of certain income and expense items for financial reporting and tax reporting purposes.
202947_15_ITEM8_P24_S3	The Company follows GAAP in accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.
202947_15_ITEM8_P24_S4	Based on its evaluation, the Company has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the consolidated financial statements.
202947_15_ITEM8_P24_S5	The Company will report any tax-related interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.
202947_15_ITEM8_P25_S0	Legal fees: The Company recognizes legal fees as incurred.
202947_15_ITEM8_P26_S0	Basic earnings per common share: Basic earnings per common share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
202947_15_ITEM8_P27_S0	New accounting standards: The Company reviews new accounting standards as issued.
202947_15_ITEM8_P27_S1	Although some of these accounting standards may be applicable to the Company, the Company expects that none of the new standards will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
202947_15_ITEM8_P28_S0	Properties and equipment: Properties and equipment consist of the following:
202947_15_ITEM8_P29_S0	In December 2012, the Company and the Bank entered into an Amended and Restated Loan Agreement pursuant to which the Company refinanced the $2,700,000 remaining balance of the 2010 debt to the Bank and borrowed an additional $3,025,000, the net proceeds of which were used to pay part of an extraordinary dividend of $2.25 per share to shareholders of record on December 17, 2012 (see Note 8).
202947_15_ITEM8_P29_S1	Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, the Company amended and restated the then existing note to the Bank, the first mortgage on Parcel 3S and 5 and certain other loan documents.

202947_15_ITEM8_P48_S0	Environmental incident (2002): In 2002, during testing of monitoring wells at the Terminal, the Company s consulting engineer discovered free floating phase product in a groundwater monitoring well located on that portion of the Terminal purchased in 2000.
202947_15_ITEM8_P48_S1	Laboratory analysis indicated that the product was gasoline, which is not a product the Company ever stored at the Terminal.
202947_15_ITEM8_P48_S2	The Company commenced an environmental investigation and analysis, the results of which indicate that the gasoline did not come from the Terminal.
202947_15_ITEM8_P48_S3	The Company notified the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management ( RIDEM ).
202947_15_ITEM8_P48_S4	RIDEM subsequently identified Power Test Realty Partnership ( Power Test ), the owner of an adjacent parcel, as a potentially responsible party for the contamination.
202947_15_ITEM8_P48_S5	Getty Properties Corp. is the general partner of Power Test.
202947_15_ITEM8_P49_S0	Power Test challenged that determination and, after an administrative hearing, in October 2008 a RIDEM Hearing Officer determined that Power Test is responsible for the discharge of the petroleum product under the Rhode Island Oil Pollution Control Act, R.I.G.L. Section 46-12.5.1-3 and Rule 6(a) and 12(b) of the Oil Pollution Control Regulations.
202947_15_ITEM8_P49_S1	The RIDEM Decision and Order requires Power Test to remediate the contamination as directed by RIDEM and remanded the proposed penalty to RIDEM for recalculation.

202947_15_ITEM8_P49_S3	In addition, in November 2008, Power Test sought, and received, a stay of the Decision and Order of the Hearing Officer pending a clarification by RIDEM of the amount of the proposed penalty.
202947_15_ITEM8_P49_S4	In October 2009, RIDEM issued a recalculated administrative penalty, and, subsequently, the RIDEM Hearing Officer issued a recommended amended decision, which was affirmed as a final decision by the RIDEM Director in December 2009.
202947_15_ITEM8_P49_S5	In January 2010, Power Test appealed that decision to the Superior Court.
202947_15_ITEM8_P49_S6	In September 2011, the Superior Court affirmed the decision of the RIDEM director.
202947_15_ITEM8_P49_S7	Power Test has appealed that decision to the Rhode Island Supreme Court.
202947_15_ITEM8_P49_S8	The Supreme Court has not decided the appeal.
202947_15_ITEM8_P50_S0	In April 2009, the Company sued Power Test and Getty Properties Corp. in the Rhode Island Superior Court seeking remediation of the site or, in the alternative, the cost of the remediation.
202947_15_ITEM8_P50_S1	On May 1, 2009, Power Test and Getty Properties Corp. removed the action to the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island ( the Court ).
202947_15_ITEM8_P51_S0	On May 22, 2009, Power Test and Getty Properties Corp. answered the Complaint and filed a Counterclaim against Dunellen, LLC and Capital Terminal Company alleging that Dunellen, LLC and Capital Terminal Company are responsible for the contamination.
202947_15_ITEM8_P51_S1	Getty Properties Corp. and Power Test joined Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc., the tenant under a long-term lease with Getty Properties Corp. of the adjacent property, as a defendant.

202947_15_ITEM8_P51_S3	Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. moved for summary judgment against the Company, Getty Properties Corp. and Power Test.
202947_15_ITEM8_P52_S0	On December 5, 2011, Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
202947_15_ITEM8_P52_S1	Thereafter, with Bankruptcy Court approval, Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. rejected its lease with Getty Properties Corp.
202947_15_ITEM8_P52_S2	On August 24, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court approved a plan to liquidate Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc.
202947_15_ITEM8_P52_S3	On January 15, 2013, the Court granted Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. s motion for summary judgment against the Company, Getty Properties Corp. and Power Test, dismissing the Company s third-party complaint.
202947_15_ITEM8_P52_S4	The parties have agreed to stay the litigation pending a determination by the Rhode Island Supreme Court on the Power Test appeal.
202947_15_ITEM8_P52_S5	There can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in this litigation.
202947_15_ITEM8_P52_S6	Since January 2003, the Company has not incurred significant costs in connection with this matter, other than ongoing litigation costs, and is unable to determine the costs it might incur to remedy the situation, as well as any costs to investigate, defend and seek reimbursement from the responsible party with respect to this contamination.
202947_15_ITEM8_P53_S0	In 1994, a leak was discovered in a 25,000 barrel storage tank at the Terminal which allowed the escape of a small amount of fuel oil.
202947_15_ITEM8_P53_S1	All required notices were made to RIDEM.
202947_15_ITEM8_P53_S2	In 2000, the tank was demolished and testing of the groundwater indicated that there was no large pooling of contaminants.
202947_15_ITEM8_P54_S0	In 2001, RIDEM approved a plan pursuant to which the Company installed a passive system consisting of three wells and commenced monitoring the wells.
202947_15_ITEM8_P55_S0	In 2003, RIDEM decided that the passive monitoring system previously approved was not sufficient and required the Company to design an active remediation system for the removal of product from the contaminated site.
202947_15_ITEM8_P55_S1	The Company and its consulting engineers began the pre-design testing of the site in the fourth quarter of 2004.
202947_15_ITEM8_P55_S2	The consulting engineers estimated a total cost of $200,000 to design, install and operate the system, which amount was accrued in 2004.
202947_15_ITEM8_P55_S3	Through 2006, the Company had expended $119,000 and has not incurred any significant costs since then.
202947_15_ITEM8_P55_S4	In 2011, RIDEM notified the company to proceed with the next phase of the approval process, notifying the abutters of the proposed remediation system even though RIDEM has not yet taken any action on the Company s proposed plan.
202947_15_ITEM8_P56_S0	As designed, the system will pump out the contaminants which will be disposed of in compliance with applicable regulations.
202947_15_ITEM8_P56_S1	After a period of time, the groundwater will be tested to determine if sufficient contaminants have been removed.
202947_15_ITEM8_P56_S2	In 2014, the Company engaged new consultants to work with RIDEM to develop the next phase of the approval process.
202947_15_ITEM8_P56_S3	While the Company and its consulting engineers believe that the proposed active remediation system will correct the situation, it is possible that RIDEM could require the Company to expand remediation efforts, which could result in the Company incurring costs in excess of the remaining accrual of $80,000.

202947_16_ITEM1_P16_S7	Commencing April 1, 2016 and on each April 1 thereafter during the initial term and any extension term, either party during the following thirty days has the right to terminate the Agreement as of April 30 of the year next following the year in which notice of termination is given.
202947_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	Commencing May 1, 2015, Sprague will reimburse the Company for any real property taxes in excess of $290,000.
202947_16_ITEM1_P17_S1	The Agreement contains other customary terms and conditions.
202947_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	The operation of a petroleum storage facility carries with it the risk of environmental contamination.
202947_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	In 2002, during testing of monitoring wells at the Terminal, the Company s consulting engineer discovered free floating phase product in a groundwater monitoring well located on that portion of the Terminal purchased in 2000.
202947_16_ITEM1_P19_S1	Laboratory analysis indicated that the product was gasoline, which is not a product the Company ever stored at the Terminal.
202947_16_ITEM1_P19_S2	The Company commenced an environmental investigation and analysis, the results of which indicate that the gasoline did not come from the Terminal.
202947_16_ITEM1_P19_S3	The Company notified the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management ( RIDEM ).
202947_16_ITEM1_P19_S4	RIDEM subsequently identified Power Test Realty Partnership ( Power Test ), the owner of an adjacent parcel, as a potentially responsible party for the contamination.
202947_16_ITEM1_P19_S5	Getty Properties Corp. is the general partner of Power Test.
202947_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	Power Test challenged that determination and, after an administrative hearing, in October 2008 a RIDEM Hearing Officer determined that Power Test is responsible for the discharge of the petroleum product under the Rhode Island Oil Pollution Control Act, R.I.G.L. Section 46-12.5.1-3 and Rule 6(a) and 12(b) of the Oil Pollution Control Regulations.
202947_16_ITEM1_P20_S1	The RIDEM Decision and Order requires Power Test to remediate the contamination as directed by RIDEM and remanded the proposed penalty to RIDEM for recalculation.
202947_16_ITEM1_P20_S2	In November 2008, Power Test appealed the decision to the Rhode Island Superior Court.
202947_16_ITEM1_P20_S3	In addition, in November 2008, Power Test sought, and received, a stay of the Decision and Order of the Hearing Officer pending a clarification by RIDEM of the amount of the proposed penalty.
202947_16_ITEM1_P20_S4	In October 2009, RIDEM issued a recalculated administrative penalty, and, subsequently, the RIDEM Hearing Officer issued a recommended amended decision, which was affirmed as a final decision by the RIDEM Director in December 2009.
202947_16_ITEM1_P20_S5	In January 2010, Power Test appealed that decision to Superior Court.
202947_16_ITEM1_P20_S6	In September 2011, the Superior Court affirmed the decision of the RIDEM director.
202947_16_ITEM1_P20_S7	Power Test has appealed that decision to the Rhode Island Supreme Court.
202947_16_ITEM1_P20_S8	On March 4, 2016 the Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Superior Court and the 2009 decision of the RIDEM Director.
202947_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	In April 2009, the Company sued Power Test and Getty Properties Corp. in the Rhode Island Superior Court seeking remediation of the site or, in the alternative, the cost of the remediation.
202947_16_ITEM1_P21_S1	On May 1, 2009, Power Test and Getty Properties Corp. removed the action to the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island ( the Court ).
202947_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	On May 22, 2009, Power Test and Getty Properties Corp. answered the Complaint and filed a Counterclaim against Dunellen, LLC and Capital Terminal Company alleging that Dunellen, LLC and Capital Terminal Company are responsible for the contamination.
202947_16_ITEM1_P22_S1	Getty Properties Corp. and Power Test joined Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc., the tenant under a long-term lease with Getty Properties Corp. of the adjacent property, as a defendant.
202947_16_ITEM1_P22_S2	The Company amended its Complaint to add Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. as a defendant.
202947_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	Marketing, Inc. moved for summary judgment against the Company, Getty Properties Corp. and Power Test.
202947_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	On December 5, 2011, Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
202947_16_ITEM1_P24_S1	Thereafter, with Bankruptcy Court approval, Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. rejected its lease with Getty Properties Corp.
202947_16_ITEM1_P24_S2	On August 24, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court approved a plan to liquidate Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc.
202947_16_ITEM1_P24_S3	On January 15, 2013, the Court granted Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. s motion for summary judgment against the Company, Getty Properties Corp. and Power Test, dismissing the Company s third-party complaint.
202947_16_ITEM1_P24_S4	The parties have agreed to stay the litigation pending a determination by the Rhode Island Supreme Court on the Power Test appeal.
202947_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	The Company is in the process of evaluating its position in the light of the Rhode Island Supreme Court decision referred to above.
202947_16_ITEM1_P25_S1	Since January 2003, the Company has not incurred significant costs in connection with this matter, other than ongoing litigation costs, and is unable to determine the costs it might incur to remedy the situation, as well as any costs to investigate, defend and seek reimbursement from the responsible party with respect to this contamination.
202947_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	In 1994, a leak was discovered in a 25,000 barrel storage tank at the Terminal which allowed the escape of a small amount of fuel oil.
202947_16_ITEM1_P26_S1	All required notices were made to RIDEM.
202947_16_ITEM1_P26_S2	In 2000, the tank was demolished and testing of the groundwater indicated that there was no large pooling of contaminants.
202947_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	In 2001, RIDEM approved a plan pursuant to which the Company installed a passive system consisting of three wells and commenced monitoring the wells.
202947_16_ITEM1_P27_S1	In 2003, RIDEM decided that the passive monitoring system previously approved was not sufficient and required the Company to design an active remediation system for the removal of product from the contaminated site.
202947_16_ITEM1_P27_S2	The Company and its consulting engineers began the pre-design testing of the site in the fourth quarter of 2004.
202947_16_ITEM1_P27_S3	The consulting engineers estimated a total cost of $200,000 to design, install and operate the system, which amount was accrued in 2004.
202947_16_ITEM1_P27_S4	Through 2006, the Company had expended $119,000 and has not incurred any significant costs since then.
202947_16_ITEM1_P27_S5	In 2011, RIDEM notified the Company to proceed with the next phase of the approval process, notifying the abutters of the proposed remediation system even though RIDEM has not yet taken any action on the Company s proposed plan.
202947_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	As designed, the system will pump out the contaminants which will be disposed of in compliance with applicable regulations.
202947_16_ITEM1_P28_S1	After a period of time, the groundwater will be tested to determine if sufficient contaminants have been removed.
202947_16_ITEM1_P28_S2	In 2014, the Company engaged new consultants to work with RIDEM to develop the next phase of the approval process.
202947_16_ITEM1_P28_S3	While the Company and its consulting engineers believe that the proposed active remediation system will correct the situation, it is possible that RIDEM could require the Company to expand remediation efforts, which could result in the Company incurring costs in excess of the remaining accrual of $79,000.
202947_16_ITEM1_P29_S0	The Company manages its exposure to contamination, remediation or similar costs associated with the Facility through adherence to established procedures for operations and equipment maintenance.
202947_16_ITEM1_P30_S0	Insurance The Company maintains what management believes to be adequate levels of insurance, including environmental insurance.
202947_16_ITEM1_P31_S0	Competition The Facility competes with several other similar facilities located on and adjacent to the Providence Harbor.
202947_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	The Terminal has approximately 48% of the total distillate storage capacity in the Providence area.
202947_16_ITEM1_P32_S1	The current tenant, Sprague, competes with other terminal operators on the basis of price, availability and a willingness to advance credit to local wholesalers.
202947_16_ITEM1_P32_S2	The amount of petroleum throughput at the Terminal is a function of Sprague s ability to compete effectively in the marketplace and the amount of product Sprague sells at its City of Providence terminal.
202947_16_ITEM1_P32_S3	The Terminal employs eight people on a full-time basis.
202947_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	owns approximately 18 acres and a historic building in and adjacent to the Capital Center District in Providence, Rhode Island.
202947_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	All of the property and a portion of the building are leased either under long-term leases or short-term leases as more particularly described in Item 1, Leasing Segment.
202947_16_ITEM2_P0_S2	The Company also owns or controls 23 locations on which 44 billboard faces have been constructed.
202947_16_ITEM2_P0_S3	All but one these locations are owned by the Company under permanent easements from a related company, the Railroad; the remaining location is leased from an unrelated third party with a remaining term of four years.
202947_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	Providence, Rhode Island on which there are located nine petroleum storage tanks and related distribution racks together with a 3,000 square foot single-story office building which houses the Company s headquarters and other support operations.
202947_16_ITEM2_P1_S1	In 2006, the Company completed the development of the land currently owned by the Company at the Terminal.
202947_16_ITEM2_P1_S2	In addition, the Company is the owner of the Pier located in East Providence, Rhode Island.
202947_16_ITEM2_P1_S3	The Pier, which has a deep water draft capacity of -40 feet Mean Low Water, can accommodate ships up to 825 feet in length.
202947_16_ITEM2_P1_S4	The Company has a permanent right to use the pipelines connecting the Pier to the Terminal.
202947_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	during the quarterly periods indicated as obtained from the OTCQX, together with cash dividends paid per share during such periods.
202947_16_ITEM5_P0_S1	Information with respect to the high and low trading prices for the Class B Common Stock was not available because the stock was not listed on any exchange, was not quoted by any quotation service, and there was no known market for such Class B Common Stock.
202947_16_ITEM5_P0_S2	At March 1, 2016, there were 450 holders of record of the Company s Class A Common Stock.
202947_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	Critical accounting policies: The Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) has issued guidance for the disclosure of critical accounting policies.
202947_16_ITEM7_P0_S1	The SEC defines such policies as those that require application of management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.
202947_16_ITEM7_P0_S2	The Company s significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
202947_16_ITEM7_P0_S3	Not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates.
202947_16_ITEM7_P0_S4	Management believes that the Company s revenue recognition policy for long-term leases with scheduled rent increases (leasing segment) meets the SEC definition of critical.
202947_16_ITEM7_P0_S5	Certain of the Company s long-term land leases have original terms of 30 to 149 years and contain scheduled rent increases where the future dollar increases are known at the time of the commencement of the lease or at a subsequent date.
202947_16_ITEM7_P0_S6	The first such lease commenced in 1988, had an original term of 99 years and provides for fixed percentage increases at specified intervals (as well as reappraisal increases).
202947_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	In accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) in accounting for leases, rental income related to the fixed percentage increases that are presently known should be recognized on a straight-line basis.
202947_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	To calculate the annual straight-line amount, the 99 known annual rental amounts are totaled and this total is divided by 99.
202947_16_ITEM7_P1_S2	In 2009, a scheduled appraisal occurred, resulting in a rental increase.
202947_16_ITEM7_P1_S3	The Company recalculated the future annual straight-line amount using the remaining years under the lease.
202947_16_ITEM7_P1_S4	The turnaround date discussed below did not change.
202947_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	For this lease, the calculated annual straight-line amount for 1988 was eight times (multiple) the amount paid by the tenant under the terms of the lease (the contractual amount ).
202947_16_ITEM7_P2_S1	In subsequent years, as the tenant pays higher rents, the multiple gradually decreases until the 57 th year of the lease, at which time the contractual amount paid by the tenant will exceed the calculated straight-line amount.
202947_16_ITEM7_P2_S2	If the Company were to report annual revenue for this lease using the straight-line amount, it would record a significant receivable for each of the first 56 years, which receivable would grow to approximately $34,000,000.
202947_16_ITEM7_P2_S3	Management does not believe that the Company should record a receivable that would not begin to be collected until the 56 th year (the turnaround date ) since management could not be assured of collection.
202947_16_ITEM7_P2_S4	In 1988, management met with the SEC accounting staff to discuss its concerns in applying GAAP as it related to a lease of this length which results in the recording of such a significant receivable that would remain on the Company s balance sheet and continue to grow on an annual basis with a turnaround date so far in the future.
202947_16_ITEM7_P2_S5	The Company presented the SEC accounting staff with an application of the accounting policy whereby management would evaluate the collectibility of the receivable on an annual basis and report as leasing revenue only that portion of the receivable that management could presently conclude would be collectible.
202947_16_ITEM7_P2_S6	The SEC accounting staff did not object to this application by the Company.
202947_16_ITEM7_P2_S7	Through December 31, 2015, the receivable on this lease has grown to $22,716,000 (cumulative excess of straight-line over contractual rentals) and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround date is still 30 years away.
202947_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	In 2004, a second such lease commenced with an original term of 149 years and provides for fixed minimum percentage increases at specified intervals (as well as reappraisal increases).
202947_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	For this lease, the contractual amount paid by the tenant will not exceed the calculated straight-line amount until the 94 th year of the lease.
202947_16_ITEM7_P3_S2	Through December 31, 2015, the receivable on this lease is $26,650,000 (cumulative excess of straight-line over contractual rentals) and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround date is 82 years away.
202947_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	In 2006, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Agreement of its lease with Lamar Outdoor Advertising LLC ( Lamar ).
202947_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	In 2013, the lease was extended to 2045 following the conversion of billboards at two locations to electronic boards, as required by the lease, resulting in a current remaining term of 30 years which provides for fixed percentage increases annually.
202947_16_ITEM7_P4_S2	For this lease, the contractual amount paid by Lamar will not exceed the calculated straight-line amount until the 23rd year of the extended lease.
202947_16_ITEM7_P4_S3	Through December 31, 2015, the receivable on this lease is $2,190,000 (cumulative excess of straight-line over contractual rentals) and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround date is 14 years away.
202947_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	Accordingly, the Company has not reported any portion of these amounts as leasing revenue in its consolidated financial statements and does not anticipate that it can reach such a conclusion until the turnaround dates are closer.
202947_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	Although the Company s other long-term land leases provide for scheduled rent increases, the provisions of the leases are such that certain future dollar amounts could not be calculated either at the time of the commencement of the lease or now, as such amounts are based on factors that are not presently known, i.e., future cost-of-living adjustments or future appraised values.
202947_16_ITEM7_P5_S2	Through December 31, 2015, the receivable on these leases is $14,389,000 and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround dates are approximately 45 years away.
202947_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	Segments: The Company operates in two segments: leasing and petroleum storage.
202947_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	The leasing segment consists of the long-term leasing of certain of its real estate interests in downtown Providence, Rhode Island (upon the commencement of which the tenants have been required to construct buildings thereon, with the exception of the parking garage and Parcels 6B and 6C), the leasing of a portion of the Steeple Street Building under short-term leasing arrangements and the leasing of locations along interstate and primary highways in Rhode Island and Massachusetts to Lamar which has constructed outdoor advertising boards thereon.
202947_16_ITEM7_P6_S2	The Company anticipates that the future development of its remaining properties in and adjacent to the Capital Center area will consist primarily of long-term ground leases.
202947_16_ITEM7_P6_S3	Pending this development, the Company leases these parcels for public parking under short-term leasing arrangements to Metropark.
202947_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	The petroleum storage segment consists of operating the petroleum storage terminal (the Terminal ) containing 1,004,000 shell barrels and the Wilkesbarre Pier (the Pier ), both of which are owned by the Company and are collectively referred to as the Facility, located in East Providence, Rhode Island for Sprague Operating Resources, LLC ( Sprague ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sprague Resources LP, which stores and distributes petroleum products.
202947_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	The principal difference between the two segments relates to the nature of the operations.
202947_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	In the leasing segment, the tenants under long-term land leases incur substantially all of the development and operating costs of the assets constructed on the Company s land, including the payment of real property taxes on both the land and any improvements constructed thereon.
202947_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	In the petroleum storage segment, the Company is responsible for the operating and maintenance expenditures and real estate taxes up to $290,000, as well as capital improvements at the Facility.
202947_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	Liquidity and capital resources: Bank loan: In December 2012, the Company and the Bank entered into an Amended and Restated Loan Agreement pursuant to which the Company refinanced the $2,700,000 balance of the 2010 debt to the Bank and borrowed an additional $3,025,000.
202947_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	In November 2015, the loan was paid in full.
202947_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	Dividend notes: On December 7, 2012, the Board of Directors of the Company declared an extraordinary dividend of $2.25 per share on its Class A and Class B common stock to shareholders of record on December 17, 2012.
202947_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	On December 27, 2012, the Company paid out $3,063,000 in cash and issued $11,787,000 in principal face amount of 5% dividend notes due December 26, 2022 (the Dividend Notes ).
202947_16_ITEM7_P10_S2	The Dividend Notes are unsecured general obligations of the Company bearing interest at the annual rate of 5% payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 to note holders of record on June 1 and December 1 of each year.
202947_16_ITEM7_P10_S3	The Dividend Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time and from time to time at the option of the Company.
202947_16_ITEM7_P10_S4	The Dividend Notes are subject to mandatory redemption in an amount equal to the Net Proceeds from the sale of any real property owned by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
202947_16_ITEM7_P10_S5	Net Proceeds is defined as the gross cash received by the Company from any such sale reduced by the sum of (a) costs relating to the sale, (b) federal and state income taxes as a result of the sale, and (c) the amount used by the Company to pay in whole or in part financial institution debts secured by a mortgage of the Company s or any subsidiary s real property regardless of whether such mortgage encumbers the property sold.
202947_16_ITEM7_P10_S6	The Company has obligated itself not to grant any mortgages on any of its property located in the Capital Center District in Providence, Rhode Island and to cause its subsidiaries not to grant any such mortgages, in each case without the consent of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding principal face amount of the Dividend Notes.
202947_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	The Dividend Notes contain other customary terms and conditions.
202947_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	The interest payments on an annual basis total $589,000.
202947_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	Petroleum storage facility: For the first four months of 2014, the Company leased a portion of the Facility (425,000 shell barrels) to Atlantic Trading Marketing, Inc. ( ATMI ) which vacated the Facility on April 30, 2014.
202947_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	On May 1, 2014, the Company entered into a Petroleum Storage Services Agreement (the Agreement ) with Sprague Operating Resources, LLC ( Sprague ) for the lease of its entire storage capacity of 1,004,000 barrels for a term of five years.
202947_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	The base rent is $3,500,000, subject to annual cost-of-living adjustments on May 1 of each year.
202947_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	There was no change in the base rent on May 1, 2015 because the cost-of-living decreased from May 1, 2014.
202947_16_ITEM7_P13_S3	In addition, the Company will receive an additional $.15 for each barrel of throughput at the Facility in excess of 3,500,000 barrels in any contract year (May 1 to April 30).
202947_16_ITEM7_P13_S4	The total throughput for the year ended April 30, 2015 did not exceed 3,500,000 barrels.
202947_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	Commencing May 1, 2015, Sprague will reimburse the Company for any real property taxes in excess of $290,000.
202947_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	There was no increase in the assessment or tax rate for the year 2015 and therefore no additional payment was due from Sprague.
202947_16_ITEM7_P14_S2	During 2015, the Company s operating activities provided $2,820,000 of cash, which was $490,000 more than the cash provided by operating activities in 2014.
202947_16_ITEM7_P14_S3	The increase in cash flows from operations was principally due to the commencement of the Sprague lease on May 1, 2014.
202947_16_ITEM7_P14_S4	Cash at December 31, 2015 decreased $702,000 from 2014 due in large part to the repayment in full of the bank loan.
202947_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	Historically, the Company has had adequate liquidity to fund its operations.
202947_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	Cash and cash commitments: At December 31, 2015, the Company had cash of $2,225,000.
202947_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	The Company and its three subsidiary companies each maintain a checking account in the same bank, each of which accounts is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to a maximum of $250,000.

202947_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	Under the terms of two long-term land leases, the scheduled annual contractual rent increased in 2015 as follows: on February 1, 2015, the rent on Parcel 8 increased $20,000, and on April 1, 2015, the rent on Parcel 7A increased $9,000.
202947_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	On July 1, 2015, rent commenced on Parcel 6C at the annual rate of $200,000.
202947_16_ITEM7_P19_S2	On April 1, 2016, under the terms of the long-term land lease on Parcel 9, the scheduled annual contractual rent will increase $18,000.
202947_16_ITEM7_P19_S3	At December 31, 2015, the Company has four tenants occupying 75 percent of the Steeple Street Building under short-term leases (five years or less) at a current total annual rental of $160,000.
202947_16_ITEM7_P19_S4	The Company is currently marketing the remaining portions of the building for lease.
202947_16_ITEM7_P19_S5	In light of the extraordinary dividend paid in December 2012, at each of the quarterly Board meetings held in 2015, the Board of Directors voted to omit the regular quarterly dividend of $0.03 per share.
202947_16_ITEM7_P19_S6	The Board will review the declaration of future dividends on a quarterly basis.
202947_16_ITEM7_P19_S7	The declaration of future dividends will depend on future earnings and financial performance.
202947_16_ITEM7_P19_S8	At December 31, 2015, the Company has no non-cancellable contract obligations other than one operating lease for a billboard location for which the rent expense is not material in amount.
202947_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	3. Results of operations: Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014 Leasing segment: Leasing revenues increased due to scheduled increases in rentals under long-term land leases and increases under short-term leases, offset in part by a decrease in percentage rent under the Lamar lease.
202947_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	Leasing expense increased due to an increase in repairs and maintenance at the Steeple Street Building.
202947_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	Petroleum storage facility revenues increased in 2015 due to Sprague leasing the entire Facility.
202947_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	Under a lease that terminated on April 30, 2014, the Company leased to ATMI a portion of the storage capacity of the Facility.
202947_16_ITEM7_P21_S2	Petroleum storage facility expense decreased due to a decrease in insurance, professional fees and depreciation expense due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated in 2015, offset in part by an increase in payroll and related costs.
202947_16_ITEM7_P21_S3	General: For the year ended December 31, 2015, general and administrative expense increased $31,000 due to an increase in payroll and related costs.
202947_16_ITEM7_P21_S4	Interest expense: For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, interest expense, bank loan was $113,000 and $164,000, respectively.
202947_16_ITEM7_P21_S5	Although the interest expense paid on the bank loan was lower due to principal prepayments in both 2014 and 2015, when the Company paid the bank loan in full in November 2015, the remaining deferred financing fees of $49,000 were written off and are included in interest expense for 2015.
202947_16_ITEM7_P21_S6	Total deferred financing fees amortized to interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $57,000.
202947_16_ITEM7_P21_S7	For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the interest expense on the dividend notes remained at the same level.
202947_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	Income taxes: For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company s effective income tax rate was approximately 40 percent.
202947_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company s effective tax rate dropped to approximately 34 percent due to a change in the Rhode Island state corporate tax rate from 9 percent to 7 percent effective January 1, 2015.
202947_16_ITEM7_P22_S2	As described in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, during 2015 the Company determined that a change in the Rhode Island corporate income tax enacted in 2014 and effective January 1, 2015 was not properly reflected in computing the Company s deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2014.
202947_16_ITEM7_P22_S3	The Company has determined that the amount ($163,000) is not material to its 2014 consolidated financial statements.
202947_16_ITEM7_P22_S4	The Company has elected to reflect the adjustment in its deferred tax liability in its 2015 consolidated financial statements which resulted in a lowering of its effective tax rate for 2015 from 39 percent to 34 percent.
202947_16_ITEM7_P22_S5	Had the Company reflected the adjustment in its 2014 consolidated financial statements, its effective tax rate would have been 32 percent as compared to the 39 percent reported.
202947_16_ITEM7_P22_S6	The effective tax rate in the quarterly consolidated financial statements for each year would have been similarly affected.
202947_16_ITEM7_P22_S7	The aggregate amount of the adjustment is $163,000, or basic income per share of $0.02.

202947_16_ITEM8_P0_S1	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Capital Properties, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income and retained earnings and cash flows for the years then ended.

202947_16_ITEM8_P0_S6	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
202947_16_ITEM8_P0_S7	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
202947_16_ITEM8_P0_S8	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
202947_16_ITEM8_P1_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
202947_16_ITEM8_P1_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
202947_16_ITEM8_P1_S2	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Capital Properties, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.

202947_16_ITEM8_P5_S0	Description of business: Capital Properties, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Tri-State Displays, Inc., Capital Terminal Company and Dunellen, LLC (collectively referred to as the Company ) operate in two segments, leasing and petroleum storage.
202947_16_ITEM8_P6_S0	The leasing segment consists of the long-term leasing of certain of its real estate interests in downtown Providence, Rhode Island (upon the commencement of which the tenants are required to construct buildings thereon, with the exception of the parking garage and Parcels 6B and 6C), the leasing of a portion of its building ( Steeple Street Building ) under short-term leasing arrangements and the leasing of locations along interstate and primary highways in Rhode Island and Massachusetts to Lamar Outdoor Advertising, LLC ( Lamar ) which has constructed outdoor advertising boards thereon.
202947_16_ITEM8_P6_S1	The Company anticipates that the future development of its remaining properties in and adjacent to the Capital Center area will consist primarily of long-term ground leases.
202947_16_ITEM8_P6_S2	Pending this development, the Company leases these parcels for public parking under short-term leasing arrangements to Metropark, Ltd. ( Metropark ).
202947_16_ITEM8_P7_S0	The petroleum storage segment consists of operating the petroleum storage terminal (the Terminal ) containing 1,004,000 shell barrels and the Wilkesbarre Pier (the Pier ), both of which are owned by the Company and are collectively referred to as the Facility, located in East Providence, Rhode Island, for Sprague Operating Resources, LLC ( Sprague ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sprague Resources, LP, which stores and distributes petroleum products.
202947_16_ITEM8_P7_S1	The principal difference between the two segments relates to the nature of the operations.
202947_16_ITEM8_P8_S0	In the leasing segment, the tenants under long-term land leases incur substantially all of the development and operating costs of the assets constructed on the Company s land, including the payment of real property taxes on both the land and any improvements constructed thereon.
202947_16_ITEM8_P8_S1	In the petroleum storage segment, the Company is responsible for the operating and maintenance expenditures and real estate taxes up to $290,000, as well as capital improvements at the Facility.
202947_16_ITEM8_P9_S0	Summary of significant accounting policies: Principles of consolidation: The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts and transactions of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
202947_16_ITEM8_P9_S1	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
202947_16_ITEM8_P10_S0	Use of estimates: The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.
202947_16_ITEM8_P10_S1	Estimates also affect the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.
202947_16_ITEM8_P10_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
202947_16_ITEM8_P11_S0	Fair value of financial instruments: The Company believes that the fair values of its financial instruments, including cash, receivables and payables, approximate their respective book values because of their short-term nature.
202947_16_ITEM8_P11_S1	Upon review of current market conditions and other factors, the Company believes that the fair value of the dividend notes payable approximates their book value.
202947_16_ITEM8_P11_S2	The fair values described herein were determined using significant other observable inputs (Level 2) as defined by GAAP.
202947_16_ITEM8_P12_S0	Properties and equipment: Properties and equipment are stated at cost.
202947_16_ITEM8_P12_S1	Acquisitions and additions are capitalized while routine maintenance and repairs, which do not improve the asset or extend its life, are charged to expense when incurred.
202947_16_ITEM8_P12_S2	Depreciation is being provided by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.
202947_16_ITEM8_P13_S0	The Company follows GAAP when accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, which requires that properties and equipment held and used by the Company be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value of the asset may not be recoverable.
202947_16_ITEM8_P14_S0	will be recognized if the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and before interest) from the use of the asset is less than the net book value of the asset.
202947_16_ITEM8_P14_S1	Generally, the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the estimated fair value of the asset.
202947_16_ITEM8_P15_S0	Cash and cash equivalents: The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
202947_16_ITEM8_P15_S1	At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had no cash equivalents.
202947_16_ITEM8_P16_S0	The Company and its three subsidiary companies each maintain a checking account in the same bank, each of which accounts is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to a maximum of $250,000.
202947_16_ITEM8_P16_S1	The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.
202947_16_ITEM8_P17_S0	Initial direct agreement costs: Initial direct agreement costs associated with the execution of a rental agreement are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable portion of the agreement term.
202947_16_ITEM8_P18_S0	Environmental incidents: The Company accrues a liability when an environmental incident has occurred and the costs are estimable.
202947_16_ITEM8_P18_S1	The Company does not record a receivable for recoveries from third parties for environmental matters until it has determined that the amount of the collection is reasonably assured.
202947_16_ITEM8_P18_S2	The accrued liability is relieved when the Company pays the liability or a third party assumes the liability.
202947_16_ITEM8_P18_S3	Upon determination that collection is reasonably assured or a third party assumes the liability, the Company records the amount as a reduction of expense.
202947_16_ITEM8_P19_S0	The Company charges to expense those costs that do not extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of the property owned or used by the Company.
202947_16_ITEM8_P20_S0	Revenues: Leasing The Company s properties leased to others are under operating leases.
202947_16_ITEM8_P20_S1	The Company reports leasing revenue when earned under the operating method.
202947_16_ITEM8_P20_S2	Certain of the Company s long-term land leases, including the outdoor advertising locations, provide for presently known scheduled rent increases over the remaining terms (30 to 138 years).
202947_16_ITEM8_P20_S3	The Company follows GAAP in accounting for leases by recognizing leasing revenue on the straight-line basis over the terms of the leases; however, the Company does not report as revenue that portion of such straight-line rentals which management is unable to conclude is realizable (collectible) due to the length of the lease terms and other related uncertainties.
202947_16_ITEM8_P21_S0	Petroleum storage facility The Company reports revenue from the operations of the Facility when earned and reports as revenue the tenant s portion of the real property taxes and certain other items as required by the lease.
202947_16_ITEM8_P21_S1	Contingent The Company reports contingent revenue in the period in which the factors occur on which the contingent payments are predicated.
202947_16_ITEM8_P22_S0	Income taxes: The Company and its subsidiaries file consolidated income tax returns.
202947_16_ITEM8_P22_S1	The Company provides for income taxes based on income reported for financial reporting purposes.
202947_16_ITEM8_P22_S2	The provision for income taxes differs from the amounts currently payable because of temporary differences associated with the recognition of certain income and expense items for financial reporting and tax reporting purposes.
202947_16_ITEM8_P22_S3	The Company follows GAAP in accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.
202947_16_ITEM8_P22_S4	Based on its evaluation, the Company has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the consolidated financial statements.
202947_16_ITEM8_P22_S5	The Company will report any tax-related interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.
202947_16_ITEM8_P23_S0	Legal fees: The Company recognizes legal fees as incurred.
202947_16_ITEM8_P24_S0	Basic earnings per common share: Basic earnings per common share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
202947_16_ITEM8_P25_S0	New accounting standards: The Company reviews new accounting standards as issued.
202947_16_ITEM8_P25_S1	Although some of these accounting standards may be applicable to the Company, the Company expects that none of the new standards will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
202947_16_ITEM8_P26_S0	Properties and equipment: Properties and equipment consist of the following:
202947_16_ITEM8_P27_S0	In December 2012, the Company and the Bank entered into an Amended and Restated Loan Agreement ( the Agreement ) pursuant to which the Company refinanced the $2,700,000 remaining balance of the 2010 debt to the Bank and borrowed an additional $3,025,000, the net proceeds of which were used to pay part of an extraordinary dividend of $2.25 per share to shareholders of record on December 17, 2012 (see Note 8).

202947_16_ITEM8_P29_S1	The Company has obligated itself not to grant any mortgages on any of its property located in the Capital Center District in Providence, Rhode Island, and to cause its subsidiaries not to grant any such mortgages, in each case without the consent of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding principal face amount of the Dividend Notes.
202947_16_ITEM8_P30_S0	The Dividend Notes contain other customary terms and conditions.
202947_16_ITEM8_P31_S0	Description of leasing arrangements: Long-term land leases: As of December 31, 2015, the Company had entered into nine long-term land leases.
202947_16_ITEM8_P31_S1	Of the nine parcels, seven have had improvements constructed thereon.
202947_16_ITEM8_P31_S2	Under the nine land leases, the tenants are required to negotiate any tax stabilization treaty or other arrangements, appeal any changes in real property assessments, and pay real property taxes assessed on land and improvements under these arrangements.
202947_16_ITEM8_P31_S3	Accordingly, real property taxes payable by the tenants are excluded from leasing revenues and leasing expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of income and retained earnings.
202947_16_ITEM8_P31_S4	For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the real property taxes attributable to the Company s land under these nine leases were $951,000 and $1,033,000, respectively.

202947_16_ITEM8_P40_S2	There was no increase in the assessment or tax rate for the year 2015 and therefore no additional payment was due from Sprague.
202947_16_ITEM8_P41_S0	The Agreement contains other customary terms and conditions.
202947_16_ITEM8_P41_S1	The Company incurred $108,000 in fees in connection with the execution of the Agreement, which amounts are being amortized on the straight-line method over the three-year non-cancellable portion of the term of the Agreement and are included in petroleum storage facility expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of income and retained earnings for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.
202947_16_ITEM8_P41_S2	At December 31, 2015 and 2014, unamortized deferred agreement costs were $48,000 and $84,000, respectively, which are included in prepaid and other on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
202947_16_ITEM8_P42_S0	The Pier is a deep-water pier in East Providence, Rhode Island owned by the Company which is integral to the operation of the Terminal.
202947_16_ITEM8_P42_S1	The Pier and the Terminal are connected by two petroleum pipelines which the Company has a permanent right to use.
202947_16_ITEM8_P43_S0	Environmental incident (2002): In 2002, during testing of monitoring wells at the Terminal, the Company s consulting engineer discovered free floating phase product in a groundwater monitoring well located on that portion of the Terminal purchased in 2000.
202947_16_ITEM8_P43_S1	Laboratory analysis indicated that the product was gasoline, which is not a product the Company ever stored at the Terminal.
202947_16_ITEM8_P43_S2	The Company commenced an environmental investigation and analysis, the results of which indicate that the gasoline did not come from the Terminal.
202947_16_ITEM8_P43_S3	The Company notified the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management ( RIDEM ).
202947_16_ITEM8_P43_S4	RIDEM subsequently identified Power Test Realty Partnership ( Power Test ), the owner of an adjacent parcel, as a potentially responsible party for the contamination.
202947_16_ITEM8_P43_S5	Getty Properties Corp. is the general partner of Power Test.
202947_16_ITEM8_P44_S0	Power Test challenged that determination and, after an administrative hearing, in October 2008 a RIDEM Hearing Officer determined that Power Test is responsible for the discharge of the petroleum product under the Rhode Island Oil Pollution Control Act, R.I.G.L. Section 46-12.5.1-3 and Rule 6(a) and 12(b) of the Oil Pollution Control Regulations.
202947_16_ITEM8_P44_S1	The RIDEM Decision and Order requires Power Test to remediate the contamination as directed by RIDEM and remanded the proposed penalty to RIDEM for recalculation.
202947_16_ITEM8_P44_S2	In November 2008, Power Test appealed the decision to the Rhode Island Superior Court.
202947_16_ITEM8_P44_S3	In addition, in November 2008, Power Test sought, and received, a stay of the Decision and Order of the Hearing Officer pending a clarification by RIDEM of the amount of the proposed penalty.
202947_16_ITEM8_P44_S4	In October 2009, RIDEM issued a recalculated administrative penalty, and, subsequently, the RIDEM Hearing Officer issued a recommended amended decision, which was affirmed as a final decision by the RIDEM Director in December 2009.
202947_16_ITEM8_P44_S5	In January 2010, Power Test appealed that decision to the Superior Court.
202947_16_ITEM8_P44_S6	In September 2011, the Superior Court affirmed the decision of the RIDEM director.
202947_16_ITEM8_P44_S7	Power Test has appealed that decision to the Rhode Island Supreme Court.
202947_16_ITEM8_P44_S8	On March 4, 2016, the Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Superior Court and the 2009 decision of the RIDEM Director.
202947_16_ITEM8_P45_S0	In April 2009, the Company sued Power Test and Getty Properties Corp. in the Rhode Island Superior Court seeking remediation of the site or, in the alternative, the cost of the remediation.
202947_16_ITEM8_P45_S1	On May 1, 2009, Power Test and Getty Properties Corp. removed the action to the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island ( the Court ).
202947_16_ITEM8_P46_S0	On May 22, 2009, Power Test and Getty Properties Corp. answered the Complaint and filed a Counterclaim against Dunellen, LLC and Capital Terminal Company alleging that Dunellen, LLC and Capital Terminal Company are responsible for the contamination.
202947_16_ITEM8_P46_S1	Getty Properties Corp. and Power Test joined Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc., the tenant under a long-term lease with Getty Properties Corp. of the adjacent property, as a defendant.
202947_16_ITEM8_P46_S2	The Company amended its Complaint to add Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. as a defendant.
202947_16_ITEM8_P46_S3	Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. moved for summary judgment against the Company, Getty Properties Corp. and Power Test.
202947_16_ITEM8_P47_S0	On December 5, 2011, Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
202947_16_ITEM8_P47_S1	Thereafter, with Bankruptcy Court approval, Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. rejected its lease with Getty Properties Corp.
202947_16_ITEM8_P47_S2	On August 24, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court approved a plan to liquidate Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc.
202947_16_ITEM8_P47_S3	On January 15, 2013, the Court granted Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. s motion for summary judgment against the Company, Getty Properties Corp. and Power Test, dismissing the Company s third-party complaint.
202947_16_ITEM8_P47_S4	The parties have agreed to stay the litigation pending a determination by the Rhode Island Supreme Court on the Power Test appeal.
202947_16_ITEM8_P47_S5	The Company is evaluating its position in light of the decision of the Supreme Court referred to above.
202947_16_ITEM8_P47_S6	Since January 2003, the Company has not incurred significant costs in connection with this matter, other than ongoing litigation costs, and is unable to determine the costs it might incur to remedy the situation, as well as any costs to investigate, defend and seek reimbursement from the responsible party with respect to this contamination.
202947_16_ITEM8_P48_S0	In 1994, a leak was discovered in a 25,000 barrel storage tank at the Terminal which allowed the escape of a small amount of fuel oil.
202947_16_ITEM8_P48_S1	All required notices were made to RIDEM.
202947_16_ITEM8_P48_S2	In 2000, the tank was demolished and testing of the groundwater indicated that there was no large pooling of contaminants.
202947_16_ITEM8_P49_S0	In 2001, RIDEM approved a plan pursuant to which the Company installed a passive system consisting of three wells and commenced monitoring the wells.
202947_16_ITEM8_P49_S1	In 2003, RIDEM decided that the passive monitoring system previously approved was not sufficient and required the Company to design an active remediation system for the removal of product from the contaminated site.
202947_16_ITEM8_P49_S2	The Company and its consulting engineers began the pre-design testing of the site in the fourth quarter of 2004.
202947_16_ITEM8_P49_S3	The consulting engineers estimated a total cost of $200,000 to design, install and operate the system, which amount was accrued in 2004.
202947_16_ITEM8_P49_S4	Through 2006, the Company had expended $119,000 and has not incurred any significant costs since then.
202947_16_ITEM8_P50_S0	the abutters of the proposed remediation system even though RIDEM has not yet taken any action on the Company s proposed plan.
202947_16_ITEM8_P51_S0	As designed, the system will pump out the contaminants which will be disposed of in compliance with applicable regulations.
202947_16_ITEM8_P51_S1	After a period of time, the groundwater will be tested to determine if sufficient contaminants have been removed.
202947_16_ITEM8_P51_S2	In 2014, the Company engaged new consultants to work with RIDEM to develop the next phase of the approval process.
202947_16_ITEM8_P51_S3	While the Company and its consulting engineers believe that the proposed active remediation system will correct the situation, it is possible that RIDEM could require the Company to expand remediation efforts, which could result in the Company incurring costs in excess of the remaining accrual of $79,000.
202947_16_ITEM8_P52_S0	Income taxes: In 2014, Rhode Island changed the tax rate for corporate taxpayers from 9 percent to 7 percent effective January 1, 2015.
202947_16_ITEM8_P52_S1	The Company failed to adjust its deferred tax liability as reported in its consolidated financial statements for December 31, 2014 to reflect the downward adjustment in the rate.
202947_16_ITEM8_P52_S2	Had the Company properly reflected the rate adjustment, it would have reported a decrease of the deferred tax liability and an increase in shareholders equity, the deferred tax benefit and net income of $163,000.
202947_16_ITEM8_P52_S3	The adjustment would have increased basic income per share by $0.02.
202947_16_ITEM8_P52_S4	The Company has determined that the effect of this error in its consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended December 31, 2014 was not material.
202947_16_ITEM8_P52_S5	The Company recorded the adjustment in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, which decreased the deferred tax liability and increased shareholders equity, the deferred tax benefit and net income by $163,000 and its effective tax rate from 39 percent to 34 percent.
202947_16_ITEM8_P52_S6	The effective tax rate in the quarterly consolidated financial statements would have been similarly affected.
202947_16_ITEM8_P53_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, income tax expense (benefit) is comprised of the following components: For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, a reconciliation of the income tax provision as computed by applying the United States income tax rate (34%) to income before income taxes is as follows: Deferred income taxes are recorded based upon differences between financial statement and tax basis amounts of assets and liabilities.
202947_16_ITEM8_P53_S1	The tax effects of temporary differences which give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows: The Company follows GAAP when reviewing all its tax positions and has determined that no reserves are required.
202947_16_ITEM8_P54_S0	Operating segment disclosures: The Company operates in two segments: (1) Leasing and (2) Petroleum Storage.
202947_16_ITEM8_P54_S1	The Company makes decisions relative to the allocation of resources and evaluates performance based on each segment s respective income before income taxes, excluding interest expense and certain corporate expenses.
202947_16_ITEM8_P54_S2	Inter-segment revenues are immaterial in amount.
202947_16_ITEM8_P54_S3	The following financial information is used for making operating decisions and assessing performance of the Company s segments:
202947_16_ITEM8_P54_S4	The following is a reconciliation of the segment information to the amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements:
202947_16_ITEM8_P55_S0	The following table sets forth those customers whose revenues exceed 10 percent of the Company s segment revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:
202947_16_ITEM8_P56_S0	Related party transaction: The Company and Providence and Worcester Railroad Company ( the Railroad ) have a common controlling shareholder.
202947_16_ITEM8_P57_S0	The Company has the right to use certain pipelines located in the right of way of the Railroad which were constructed by Getty Oil Company (Eastern Operations), Inc.
202947_16_ITEM8_P57_S1	In May 2012, the Company and Railroad entered into a License Agreement licensing to the Company track facilities which may be installed in connection with a railcar-loading/unloading facility upon Railroad s right-of-way.
202947_16_ITEM8_P57_S2	The License Agreement continues through December 31, 2015, and thereafter is extended for additional three-year periods unless cancelled by the Company upon thirty days written notice prior to termination.
202947_16_ITEM8_P57_S3	The Company did not cancel the License Agreement and it is therefore extended to December 31, 2018.
202947_16_ITEM9_P0_S0	There were no changes in, or disagreements with, accountants on accounting or financial disclosure as defined by Item 304 of Regulation S-K.
202947_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Under the supervision of the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report.
202947_16_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of such date, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in making them aware on a timely basis of the material information relating to the Company required to be included in the Company s periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
202947_16_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act).
202947_16_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Company s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of its financial reporting and the preparation of published financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.
202947_16_ITEM9A_P1_S2	However, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
202947_16_ITEM9A_P1_S3	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
202947_16_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies may deteriorate.
202947_16_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management conducted its evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) as of December 31, 2015.
202947_16_ITEM9A_P3_S0	During 2015, the Company did not properly reflect the decrease of the Rhode Island corporate tax rate into its calculation of the deferred tax liability in its consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2014 or 2015.
202947_16_ITEM9A_P3_S1	The Company utilizes a third-party professional firm to review the tax provision as a control over the accuracy of the tax calculation; however, the control did not detect the error.
202947_16_ITEM9A_P3_S2	The Company has evaluated this control deficiency using guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and determined it was a significant deficiency.
202947_16_ITEM9A_P3_S3	The Company has revised the control procedure applied by the third-party professional firm to include a second level of review.
202947_16_ITEM9A_P3_S4	Based on this assessment, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer believe that as of December 31, 2015, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on criteria set forth by COSO in 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework.
202947_16_ITEM9A_P3_S5	This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
202947_16_ITEM9A_P3_S6	Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report.
202947_16_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting During the quarter ended December 31, 2015, there has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

202947_17_ITEM1_P0_S0	Organizational History The Company was organized as a business corporation under the laws of Rhode Island in 1983 as Providence and Worcester Company and is the successor by merger in 1983 to a corporation also named Providence and Worcester Company which was organized under the laws of Delaware in 1979.
202947_17_ITEM1_P0_S1	In 1984, the Company s name was changed to Capital Properties, Inc.
202947_17_ITEM1_P1_S0	Segments Prior to December 20, 2016, the Company operated in two segments: leasing and petroleum storage.
202947_17_ITEM1_P2_S0	On December 20, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors authorized the sale of the Company s petroleum storage facility and related assets to Sprague Operating Resources, LLC, a subsidiary of Sprague Resources LP (collectively referred to as Sprague ), for a purchase price of $23 Million (subject to certain adjustments) resulting in the petroleum storage business (the Petroleum Segment ) being classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
202947_17_ITEM1_P2_S1	On January 24, 2017, the Company entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement with Sprague (the Sale Agreement ) and the transaction was consummated on February 10, 2017.
202947_17_ITEM1_P2_S2	See Notes 9 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
202947_17_ITEM1_P3_S0	The Board s decision to authorize the sale of the Petroleum Segment to Sprague, which has been exclusively leasing the petroleum storage facility and related assets since May 1, 2014, was partly based on an evaluation of the Petroleum Segment s economic future as solely a distillate terminal and the significant capital investment and substantial risk related to converting a significant portion of the petroleum storage facility to gasoline in order to increase revenue.
202947_17_ITEM1_P3_S1	The Board concluded that a sale to Sprague was in the best interest of the Company s shareholders.
202947_17_ITEM1_P3_S2	As a result of the sale of its petroleum storage and related assets, the Company s operations are limited to leasing its real estate interests.
202947_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	The Company s principal business is the leasing of Company-owned land in the Capital Center area ( Capital Center ) in downtown Providence, Rhode Island under long-term ground leases.
202947_17_ITEM1_P4_S1	The Company owns approximately 18 acres in the Capital Center consisting of 13 individual parcels.
202947_17_ITEM1_P5_S0	The Capital Center (approximately 77 acres of land) is the result of a development project undertaken by the State of Rhode Island, the City of Providence, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation ( Amtrak ) and the Company during the 1980 s in which two rivers, the Moshassuck and the Woonasquatucket, were moved, Amtrak s Northeast Corridor rail line was relocated, a new Amtrak/commuter railroad station was constructed and significant public improvements were made to improve pedestrian and vehicular traffic in the area.
202947_17_ITEM1_P5_S1	With the exception of the Steeple Street property (see Parcel 20 defined below), the Company has not acted, and does not intend to act, as a developer with respect to any improvements constructed on Company-owned parcels.
202947_17_ITEM1_P5_S2	Rather, the Company offers individual parcels for lease pursuant to long-term ground leases with terms of 99 years or more.
202947_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	Each lease contains provisions permitting the tenant to develop the parcel under certain terms and conditions.
202947_17_ITEM1_P6_S1	Each lease provides for periodic rent adjustments of various kinds.
202947_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	Under the leases, the tenants are responsible for insuring the Company against various hazards and events.
202947_17_ITEM1_P7_S1	Each tenant is required to indemnify the Company with respect to all of the tenant s activities on the land.
202947_17_ITEM1_P7_S2	The leases contain other terms and conditions customary to such instruments.
202947_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	The Company first began offering parcels for lease in the Capital Center area in the late 1980 s.
202947_17_ITEM1_P8_S1	As of December 31, 2016, nine parcels have been leased by the Company under long-term leases of 99 years or more.
202947_17_ITEM1_P8_S2	Of the nine parcels, eight have improvements constructed thereon or under construction as follows:
202947_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	While seeking developers, the Company also leases Parcels 3E, 3W, 4E and 4W in the Capital Center area for public parking purposes on a short-term basis to Metropark, Ltd.
202947_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	Parcel 20 Adjacent to the Capital Center Since the 1980 s, the Company has owned an undeveloped parcel of land adjacent to the Capital Center, which is leased out for public parking purposes on a short-term basis.
202947_17_ITEM1_P10_S1	In 2007, the Company purchased the adjacent parcel containing a three/four-story 18,000 square foot building (the Steeple Street Building ) and related land for $2,329,000, which, together with the previously-owned land, now comprises Parcel 20, containing 26,600 square feet.
202947_17_ITEM1_P10_S2	The Steeple Street Building is on the State Registry of Historic Buildings.
202947_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	During 2010-2011, the Company substantially rehabilitated the Steeple Street Building.
202947_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	The Steeple Street Building has three commercial tenants with additional space available for lease.
202947_17_ITEM1_P12_S1	All of the properties described above are shown on a map contained in Exhibit 20.
202947_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	Lamar Lease The Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, leases 23 outdoor advertising locations containing 44 billboard faces along interstate and primary highways in Rhode Island and Massachusetts to Lamar Outdoor Advertising, LLC ( Lamar ) under a lease which expires in 2045.
202947_17_ITEM1_P13_S1	All but one of these locations are controlled by the Company through permanent easements granted to the Company pursuant to an agreement between the Company and Providence Worcester Railroad Company ( Railroad the remaining location is leased by the Company from a third party with a remaining term of three years.
202947_17_ITEM1_P13_S2	Although no new locations have been added since 2002, in 2013 Lamar converted billboards at two locations to electronic boards, which conversions extended the term of the lease for a total of twelve years to 2045.
202947_17_ITEM1_P13_S3	Lamar has a right of first refusal for additional billboard location sites acquired by the Company in New England and Metropolitan New York City.
202947_17_ITEM1_P13_S4	The lease with Lamar provides, among other things, for the following: (1) the base rent increases annually at the rate of 2.75% for each leased billboard location commencing June 1, 2006 and on each June 1 thereafter; and (2) in addition to base rent, for each 12-month period commencing each June 1, Lamar must pay to the Company 30% of the gross revenues from each standard billboard and 20% of the gross revenues from each electronic billboard for such 12-month period, reduced by the sum of (a) commissions paid to third parties and (b) the base monthly rent for each leased billboard display for such 12-month period.
202947_17_ITEM1_P13_S5	The Lamar lease contains other terms and conditions customary to such instruments.
202947_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	A summary of the long-term leases which have commenced is as follows:
202947_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	Major tenants: The following table sets forth those major tenants whose revenues exceed 10 percent of the Company s leasing revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:
202947_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	Competition The Company competes for tenants with other owners of undeveloped real property in downtown Providence.
202947_17_ITEM1_P16_S1	The Company maintains no listing of other competitive properties and will not engage in a competitive bid arrangement with proposed developers.
202947_17_ITEM1_P16_S2	The Company s refusal to sell the land that it owns may restrict the number of interested developers.
202947_17_ITEM1_P16_S3	As to the Steeple Street Building, the Company competes for tenants with other office and commercial buildings located in downtown Providence.
202947_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	As of December 31, 2016, the Company had eleven employees, of which seven were employed exclusively by the Petroleum Segment.
202947_17_ITEM1_P17_S1	As a result of the sale of the Petroleum Segment, the Company now has four employees.
202947_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	Prior to February 10, 2017, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Dunellen, LLC ( Dunellen ) and Capital Terminal Company, owned and operated a petroleum storage terminal containing 1,004,000 shell barrels (the Terminal ) and the Wilkesbarre Pier (the Pier ), collectively referred to as the Facility, located in East Providence, Rhode Island.
202947_17_ITEM1_P18_S1	The Terminal utilized the Pier and two 16 pipelines connecting the Pier to the Terminal.
202947_17_ITEM1_P18_S2	During 2016, the Facility was leased to Sprague pursuant to a lease dated May 1, 2014.
202947_17_ITEM1_P18_S3	Sprague paid an annual rent of $3,500,000 and the Company paid substantially all of the operating costs related to the Facility.
202947_17_ITEM1_P18_S4	In April 2016, as permitted by the lease, Sprague gave Dunellen notice of its intention to terminate the lease effective May 1, 2017.
202947_17_ITEM1_P18_S5	In January 2017, the Company took title to the pipelines and the related easement from Getty Properties Corp. ( Getty ).
202947_17_ITEM1_P18_S6	Getty also conveyed to Dunellen all of its interest in and to the Pier.
202947_17_ITEM1_P18_S7	As noted above, on February 10, 2017, the Company sold the Terminal, the Pier and related facilities, including the pipelines, to Sprague.
202947_17_ITEM1_P18_S8	See Notes 9 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
202947_17_ITEM1_P18_S9	Environmental See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of environmental matters affecting the Company.
202947_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	Insurance The Company maintains what management believes to be adequate levels of insurance.
202947_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	owns approximately 18 acres and a historic building in and adjacent to the Capital Center District in Providence, Rhode Island.
202947_17_ITEM2_P0_S1	All of the property and a portion of the building are leased either under long-term leases or short-term leases as more particularly described in Item 1, Leasing Business.
202947_17_ITEM2_P0_S2	The Company also owns or controls 23 locations on which 44 billboard faces have been constructed.
202947_17_ITEM2_P0_S3	All but one these locations are owned by the Company under permanent easements from the Railroad; the remaining location is leased from an unrelated third party with a remaining term of three years.
202947_17_ITEM2_P0_S4	As of December 31, 2016, the Company also owned the Pier and an approximate 10-acre site in East Providence, Rhode Island on which there are located nine petroleum storage tanks, related distribution racks and a single-story office building which housed the Company s headquarters and other support operations.
202947_17_ITEM2_P0_S5	On December 20, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized the sale of these properties to Sprague.
202947_17_ITEM2_P0_S6	Accordingly, these properties were reclassified as Assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016.
202947_17_ITEM2_P0_S7	The properties were sold to Sprague on February 10, 2017.
202947_17_ITEM2_P1_S0	See Discontinued Operations above and Notes 9 and 10 to Consolidated Financial Statements.
202947_17_ITEM5_P0_S0	during the quarterly periods indicated as obtained from the OTCQX, together with cash dividends paid per share during such periods.
202947_17_ITEM5_P1_S0	At March 1, 2017, there were 415 holders of record of the Company s Class A Common Stock.
202947_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U. S. GAAP ).
202947_17_ITEM7_P0_S1	Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the present year presentation.
202947_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations excludes the results of our discontinued operations unless otherwise noted.
202947_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	See Notes 9 and 10, Discontinued Operations and Subsequent Events in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these operations.
202947_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	Critical accounting policies: The Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) has issued guidance for the disclosure of critical accounting policies.
202947_17_ITEM7_P2_S1	The SEC defines such policies as those that require application of management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.
202947_17_ITEM7_P2_S2	The Company s significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
202947_17_ITEM7_P2_S3	Not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates.
202947_17_ITEM7_P2_S4	Management believes that the Company s revenue recognition policy for long-term leases with scheduled rent increases meets the SEC definition of critical.
202947_17_ITEM7_P2_S5	Certain of the Company s long-term land leases have original terms of 30 to 149 years and contain scheduled rent increases where the future dollar increases are known at the time of the commencement of the lease or at a subsequent date.
202947_17_ITEM7_P2_S6	The first such lease commenced in 1988, had an original term of 99 years and provides for fixed percentage increases at specified intervals (as well as reappraisal increases).
202947_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	In accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) in accounting for leases, rental income related to the fixed percentage increases that are presently known should be recognized on a straight-line basis.
202947_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	To calculate the annual straight-line amount, the 99 known annual rental amounts are totaled and this total is divided by 99.
202947_17_ITEM7_P3_S2	In 2009, a scheduled appraisal occurred, resulting in a rental increase.
202947_17_ITEM7_P3_S3	The Company recalculated the future annual straight-line amount using the remaining years under the lease.
202947_17_ITEM7_P3_S4	The turnaround date discussed below did not change.
202947_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	For this lease, the calculated annual straight-line amount for 1988 was eight times (multiple) the amount paid by the tenant under the terms of the lease (the contractual amount ).
202947_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	In subsequent years, as the tenant pays higher rents, the multiple gradually decreases until the 57 th year of the lease, at which time the contractual amount paid by the tenant will exceed the calculated straight-line amount.
202947_17_ITEM7_P4_S2	If the Company were to report annual revenue for this lease using the straight-line amount, it would record a significant receivable for each of the first 56 years, which receivable would grow to approximately $34,000,000.
202947_17_ITEM7_P4_S3	Management does not believe that the Company should record a receivable that would not begin to be collected until the 56 th year (the turnaround date ) since management could not be assured of collection.
202947_17_ITEM7_P4_S4	In 1988, management met with the SEC accounting staff to discuss its concerns in applying GAAP as it related to a lease of this length which results in the recording of such a significant receivable that would remain on the Company s balance sheet and continue to grow on an annual basis with a turnaround date so far in the future.
202947_17_ITEM7_P4_S5	The Company presented the SEC accounting staff with an application of the accounting policy whereby management would evaluate the collectibility of the receivable on an annual basis and report as leasing revenue only that portion of the receivable that management could presently conclude would be collectible.
202947_17_ITEM7_P4_S6	The SEC accounting staff did not object to this application by the Company.
202947_17_ITEM7_P4_S7	Through December 31, 2016, the receivable on this lease has grown to $23,301,000 (cumulative excess of straight-line over contractual rentals) and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround date is still 29 years away.
202947_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	In 2004, a second such lease commenced with an original term of 149 years and provides for fixed minimum percentage increases at specified intervals (as well as reappraisal increases).
202947_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	For this lease, the contractual amount paid by the tenant will not exceed the calculated straight-line amount until the 94 th year of the lease.
202947_17_ITEM7_P5_S2	Through December 31, 2016, the receivable on this lease is $28,749,000 (cumulative excess of straight-line over contractual rentals) and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround date is 81 years away.
202947_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	In 2006, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Agreement of its lease with Lamar Outdoor Advertising LLC ( Lamar ).
202947_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	In 2013, the lease was extended to 2045 following the conversion of billboards at two locations to electronic boards, as required by the lease, resulting in a current remaining term of 30 years which provides for fixed percentage increases annually.
202947_17_ITEM7_P6_S2	For this lease, the contractual amount paid by Lamar will not exceed the calculated straight-line amount until the 23rd year of the extended lease.
202947_17_ITEM7_P6_S3	Through December 31, 2016, the receivable on this lease is $2,501,000 (cumulative excess of straight-line over contractual rentals) and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround date is 13 years away.
202947_17_ITEM7_P6_S4	Accordingly, the Company has not reported any portion of these amounts as leasing revenue in its consolidated financial statements and does not anticipate that it can reach such a conclusion until the turnaround dates are closer.
202947_17_ITEM7_P6_S5	Although the Company s other long-term land leases provide for scheduled rent increases, the provisions of the leases are such that certain future dollar amounts could not be calculated either at the time of the commencement of the lease or now, as such amounts are based on factors that are not presently known, i.e., future cost-of-living adjustments or future appraised values.
202947_17_ITEM7_P6_S6	Through December 31, 2016, the receivable on these leases is $15,251,000 and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround dates are approximately 44 years away.
202947_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	Liquidity and capital resources: Historically, the Company generates adequate liquidity to fund its operations.
202947_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	Cash and cash commitments: At December 31, 2016, the Company had cash of $3,124,000.
202947_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	The Company and its three subsidiary companies each maintain a checking account in the same bank; the aggregate of each Company s accounts is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to a maximum of $250,000.
202947_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	The Company periodically evaluates the financial stability of the financial institution at which the Company s funds are held.
202947_17_ITEM7_P9_S1	Under the terms of the long-term land lease on Parcel 7A, the land will be appraised in the first quarter of 2017 which may result in an increase in rent effective April 1, 2017.
202947_17_ITEM7_P9_S2	On April 1, 2016, under the terms of the long-term land lease on Parcel 9, the scheduled annual contractual rent increased $18,000.
202947_17_ITEM7_P9_S3	Under the terms of two long-term land leases, the scheduled annual contractual rent increased in 2015 as follows: on February 1, 2015, the rent on Parcel 8 increased $20,000, and on April 1, 2015, the rent on Parcel 7A increased $9,000.
202947_17_ITEM7_P9_S4	On July 1, 2015, rent commenced on Parcel 6C at the annual rate of $200,000.
202947_17_ITEM7_P9_S5	At December 31, 2016, the Company has three tenants occupying 54 percent of the Steeple Street Building under short-term leases (five years or less) at a current total annual rental of $125,000.
202947_17_ITEM7_P9_S6	The Company is currently marketing the remaining portions of the building for lease.
202947_17_ITEM7_P9_S7	In light of the extraordinary dividend paid in December 2012, at each of the quarterly Board meetings held in 2016, the Board of Directors voted to omit the regular quarterly dividend of $0.03 per share.
202947_17_ITEM7_P9_S8	The Board will review the declaration of future dividends on a quarterly basis.
202947_17_ITEM7_P9_S9	The declaration of future dividends will depend on future earnings and financial performance.
202947_17_ITEM7_P9_S10	At December 31, 2016, the Company has no non-cancellable contract obligations other than one operating lease for a billboard location for which the rent expense is not material in amount.
202947_17_ITEM7_P9_S11	On February 24, 2017, the Company issued a notice of mandatory redemption of the entire remaining outstanding balance of its Dividend Notes on March 31, 2017.
202947_17_ITEM7_P9_S12	The principal balance plus accrued interest to the date of redemption is $10,764,000.
202947_17_ITEM7_P9_S13	The Company received $19,794,000 from the sale of its petroleum storage business after giving effect to escrows, a credit to Sprague for the cost of constructing a turning dolphin adjacent to the Pier, and other customary closing costs.
202947_17_ITEM7_P9_S14	The Company estimates that the federal and state income taxes arising from the sale will total approximately $8,600,000.
202947_17_ITEM7_P9_S15	The balance of the proceeds will be used to effect the redemption of the Dividend Notes on March 31, 2017.
202947_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	3. Results of operations: Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015 Revenues increased $102,000 from 2015 due to scheduled increases in rentals under long-term land leases and increases under short-term leases, offset in part by a decrease in contingent rent under the Lamar lease.
202947_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	Expenses decreased $31,000 due to a decrease in repairs and maintenance at the Steeple Street Building and a decrease in insurance premiums, offset in part by an increase in the City of Providence real estate taxes.
202947_17_ITEM7_P10_S2	General and administrative expense increased $74,000 due to legal fees incurred in connection with the partial redemption of the Dividend Notes and other Company initiatives.
202947_17_ITEM7_P10_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the interest expense on the dividend notes was $578,000 and $589,000, respectively.
202947_17_ITEM7_P10_S4	In June 2016, the Company redeemed 10 percent of the face value of the Dividend Notes.
202947_17_ITEM7_P10_S5	In November 2015, the Company paid the bank loan in full.
202947_17_ITEM7_P10_S6	The interest expense on the bank loan for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $113,000.
202947_17_ITEM7_P10_S7	The remaining deferred financing fees of $49,000 relating to the bank loan were written off and were included in interest expense for 2015.
202947_17_ITEM7_P10_S8	Total deferred financing fees amortized to interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $57,000.
202947_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	In 2014, Rhode Island changed the tax rate for corporate taxpayers from 9 percent to 7 percent effective January 1, 2015.
202947_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	As described in Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, during 2015 the Company determined that a change in the Rhode Island corporate income tax enacted in 2014 and effective January 1, 2015 was not properly reflected in computing the Company s deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2014.
202947_17_ITEM7_P11_S2	The Company elected to reflect the adjustment in its deferred tax liability in its 2015 consolidated financial statements which resulted in a lowering of its effective tax rate for 2015 from 39 percent to 34 percent.
202947_17_ITEM7_P11_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company s effective tax rate was approximately 39 percent.

202947_17_ITEM8_P1_S6	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
202947_17_ITEM8_P1_S7	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
202947_17_ITEM8_P1_S8	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
202947_17_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
202947_17_ITEM8_P2_S1	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
202947_17_ITEM8_P2_S2	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Capital Properties, Inc. as of December 31, 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
202947_17_ITEM8_P2_S3	We also have audited the retrospective adjustments to the 2015 consolidated financial statements for the operations discontinued in 2016, as discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
202947_17_ITEM8_P2_S4	Our procedures included (1) obtaining the Company s underlying accounting analysis prepared by management of the retrospective adjustments for discontinued operations and comparing the retrospectively adjusted amounts per the 2015 consolidated financial statements to such analysis, (2) comparing previously reported amounts to the previously issued consolidated financial statements for 2015, (3) testing the mathematical accuracy of the accounting analysis, and (4) on a test basis, comparing the adjustments to retrospectively adjust the financial statements for discontinued operations to the Company s supporting documentation.
202947_17_ITEM8_P2_S5	In our opinion, such retrospective adjustments are appropriate and have been properly applied.
202947_17_ITEM8_P2_S6	However, we were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2015 consolidated financial statements of the Company other than with respect to the retrospective adjustments and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2015 consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

202947_17_ITEM8_P6_S0	AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.
202947_17_ITEM8_P7_S0	Description of business: Capital Properties, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Tri-State Displays, Inc., Capital Terminal Company and Dunellen, LLC (collectively referred to as the Company ) operated in two segments, leasing and petroleum storage, for many years.
202947_17_ITEM8_P7_S1	On December 20, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors authorized the sale of the Company s petroleum storage facility and related assets.
202947_17_ITEM8_P7_S2	The Company concluded that the sale of the petroleum storage facility met the criteria of a discontinued operation in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) and therefore the petroleum storage segment is reported as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.
202947_17_ITEM8_P8_S0	The Company s continuing operations consist of the long-term leasing of certain of its real estate interests in downtown Providence, Rhode Island (upon the commencement of which the tenants have been required to construct buildings thereon, with the exception of the parking garage and Parcel 6C), the leasing of a portion of its building ( Steeple Street Building ) under short-term leasing arrangements and the leasing of locations along interstate and primary highways in Rhode Island and Massachusetts to Lamar Outdoor Advertising, LLC ( Lamar ) which has constructed outdoor advertising boards thereon.
202947_17_ITEM8_P8_S1	The Company anticipates that the future development of its remaining properties in and adjacent to the Capital Center area will consist primarily of long-term ground leases.
202947_17_ITEM8_P8_S2	Pending this development, the Company leases these parcels for public parking under short-term leasing arrangements to Metropark.
202947_17_ITEM8_P9_S0	The discontinued operations consist of operating the petroleum storage terminal (the Terminal ) containing 1,004,000 shell barrels and the Wilkesbarre Pier (the Pier ), both of which are collectively referred to as the Facility, located in East Providence, Rhode Island, for Sprague Operating Resources, LLC, a subsidiary of Sprague Resources, LP (collectively referred to as Sprague ), which stores and distributes petroleum products.
202947_17_ITEM8_P10_S0	Summary of significant accounting policies: Principles of consolidation: The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts and transactions of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
202947_17_ITEM8_P10_S1	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
202947_17_ITEM8_P11_S0	Use of estimates: The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.
202947_17_ITEM8_P11_S1	Estimates also affect the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.
202947_17_ITEM8_P11_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
202947_17_ITEM8_P12_S0	Fair value of financial instruments: The Company believes that the fair values of its financial instruments, including cash and payables, approximate their respective book values because of their short-term nature.
202947_17_ITEM8_P12_S1	Upon review of current market conditions and other factors, the Company believes that the fair value of the dividend notes payable approximates their book value.
202947_17_ITEM8_P12_S2	The fair values described herein were determined using significant other observable inputs (Level 2) as defined by GAAP.
202947_17_ITEM8_P13_S0	Properties and equipment: Properties and equipment are stated at cost.
202947_17_ITEM8_P13_S1	Acquisitions and additions are capitalized while routine maintenance and repairs, which do not improve the asset or extend its life, are charged to expense when incurred.
202947_17_ITEM8_P13_S2	Depreciation is being provided by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.
202947_17_ITEM8_P14_S0	The Company reviews properties and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value of the asset may not be recoverable.
202947_17_ITEM8_P14_S1	An impairment loss will be recognized if the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and before interest) from the use of the asset is less than the net book value of the asset.
202947_17_ITEM8_P14_S2	Generally, the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the estimated fair value of the asset.
202947_17_ITEM8_P15_S0	Cash and cash equivalents: The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
202947_17_ITEM8_P15_S1	At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no cash equivalents.
202947_17_ITEM8_P16_S0	The Company and its three subsidiary companies each maintain a checking account in the same bank; the aggregate of each Company s accounts is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to a maximum of $250,000.
202947_17_ITEM8_P16_S1	The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.
202947_17_ITEM8_P17_S0	Initial direct agreement costs: Initial direct agreement costs associated with the execution of a rental agreement are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable portion of the agreement term.
202947_17_ITEM8_P18_S0	Environmental incidents: The Company accrues a liability when an environmental incident has occurred and the costs are estimable.
202947_17_ITEM8_P18_S1	The Company does not record a receivable for recoveries from third parties for environmental matters until it has determined that the amount of the collection is reasonably assured.
202947_17_ITEM8_P18_S2	The accrued liability is relieved when the Company pays the liability or a third party assumes the liability.
202947_17_ITEM8_P18_S3	Upon determination that collection is reasonably assured or a third party assumes the liability, the Company records the amount as a reduction of expense.
202947_17_ITEM8_P19_S0	The Company charges to expense those costs that do not extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of the property owned or used by the Company.
202947_17_ITEM8_P20_S0	Revenues: The Company s properties leased to others are under operating leases.
202947_17_ITEM8_P20_S1	The Company reports leasing revenue when earned under the operating method.
202947_17_ITEM8_P20_S2	Certain of the Company s long-term land leases, including the outdoor advertising locations, provide for presently known scheduled rent increases over the remaining terms (30 to 138 years).
202947_17_ITEM8_P20_S3	The Company follows GAAP in accounting for leases by recognizing leasing revenue on the straight-line basis over the terms of the leases; however, the Company does not report as revenue that portion of such straight-line rentals which management is unable to conclude is realizable (collectible) due to the length of the lease terms and other related uncertainties.
202947_17_ITEM8_P20_S4	The Company reports contingent revenue in the period in which the factors occur on which the contingent payments are predicated.
202947_17_ITEM8_P20_S5	The Company reports revenue from the petroleum storage facility included in discontinued operations when earned and reports as revenue the tenant s portion of the real property taxes and certain other items as required by the lease.
202947_17_ITEM8_P21_S0	Income taxes: The Company and its subsidiaries file consolidated income tax returns.
202947_17_ITEM8_P21_S1	The Company provides for income taxes based on income reported for financial reporting purposes.
202947_17_ITEM8_P21_S2	The provision for income taxes differs from the amounts currently payable because of temporary differences associated with the recognition of certain income and expense items for financial reporting and tax reporting purposes.
202947_17_ITEM8_P21_S3	Based on its evaluation, the Company has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the consolidated financial statements.
202947_17_ITEM8_P21_S4	The Company will report any tax-related interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.
202947_17_ITEM8_P22_S0	The Company s federal and state income tax returns are generally open for examination for the past three years.
202947_17_ITEM8_P23_S0	Legal fees: The Company recognizes legal fees as incurred.
202947_17_ITEM8_P24_S0	Basic earnings per common share: Basic earnings per common share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
202947_17_ITEM8_P25_S0	Retrospective Adjustment: Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements for 2015 have been retrospectively adjusted as described in Note 9 hereof.
202947_17_ITEM8_P26_S0	Recent accounting pronouncements: In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes .
202947_17_ITEM8_P26_S1	The new standard eliminates the current requirement for organizations to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet.
202947_17_ITEM8_P26_S2	Instead, organizations will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent.
202947_17_ITEM8_P26_S3	The amendments are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods.
202947_17_ITEM8_P26_S4	ASU 2015-17 will not affect the Company s balance sheet presentation in future periods because the Company does not present a classified balance sheet.
202947_17_ITEM8_P26_S5	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing all lease transactions (with terms in excess of 12 months) on the balance sheet as a lease liability and a right-of-use asset (as defined).
202947_17_ITEM8_P26_S6	The ASU requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases.
202947_17_ITEM8_P26_S7	The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier application permitted.
202947_17_ITEM8_P26_S8	Upon adoption, the lessee and lessor will apply the new standard retrospectively to all periods presented or retrospectively using a cumulative effect adjustment in the year of adoption.
202947_17_ITEM8_P26_S9	The Company is still assessing the impact of adopting the ASU but expects that its leases where it is the lessor will be accounted for as operating leases similar to its current accounting.
202947_17_ITEM8_P26_S10	For additional information on the Company s leases, see Note 5 herein.
202947_17_ITEM8_P27_S0	In January 2017 the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-03, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections (Topic 250) and Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323).
202947_17_ITEM8_P27_S1	The amendments in the Update relate to SEC paragraphs pursuant to Staff Announcements at the September 22, 2016 and November 17, 2016 EITF meetings related to disclosure of the impact of recently issued accounting standards.
202947_17_ITEM8_P27_S2	The SEC staff view that a registrant should evaluate ASC updates that have not yet been adopted to determine the appropriate financial disclosures about the potential material effects of the updates on the financial statements when adopted.
202947_17_ITEM8_P27_S3	If a registrant does not know or cannot reasonably estimate the impact of an update, then in addition to making a statement to that effect, the registrant should consider additional qualitative financial statement disclosures to assist the reader in assessing the significance of the impact.
202947_17_ITEM8_P27_S4	The staff expects the additional qualitative disclosures to include a description of the effect of the accounting policies expected to be applied compared to current accounting policies.
202947_17_ITEM8_P27_S5	Also, the registrant should describe the status of its process to implement the new standards and the significant implementation matters yet to be addressed.
202947_17_ITEM8_P27_S6	The amendments specifically addressed recent ASC amendments to Topic 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses, Topic 842, Leases, and Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, although, the amendments apply to any subsequent amendments to guidance in the ASC.
202947_17_ITEM8_P27_S7	The Company adopted the amendments in this Update during the fourth quarter of 2016 and appropriate disclosures have been included in this Note for each recently issued accounting standard.
202947_17_ITEM8_P28_S0	Properties and equipment: Properties and equipment (exclusive of assets held for sale) consist of the following:
202947_17_ITEM8_P29_S0	In 2016, the Company wrote off fully depreciated equipment no longer in service totaling $17,000.
202947_17_ITEM8_P30_S0	4. Notes payable: Dividend notes: In 2012, the Company issued $11,787,000 in principal face amount of 5% dividend notes due December 26, 2022 (the Dividend Notes ).
202947_17_ITEM8_P30_S1	The Dividend Notes are unsecured general obligations of the Company bearing interest at the annual rate of 5% payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 to note holders of record on June 1 and December 1 of each year.
202947_17_ITEM8_P30_S2	The Dividend Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time and from time to time at the option of the Company.
202947_17_ITEM8_P30_S3	The Dividend Notes are subject to mandatory redemption in an amount equal to the Net Proceeds from the sale of any real property owned by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
202947_17_ITEM8_P30_S4	Net Proceeds is defined as the gross cash received by the Company from any such sale reduced by the sum of (a) costs relating to the sale, (b) federal and state income taxes as a result of the sale, and (c) the amount used by the Company to pay in whole or in part financial institution debts secured by a mortgage of the Company s or any subsidiary s real property regardless of whether such mortgage encumbers the property sold.
202947_17_ITEM8_P30_S5	The Company has obligated itself not to grant any mortgages on any of its property located in the Capital Center District in Providence, Rhode Island, and to cause its subsidiaries not to grant any such mortgages, in each case without the consent of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding principal face amount of the Dividend Notes.
202947_17_ITEM8_P31_S0	The Dividend Notes contain other customary terms and conditions.
202947_17_ITEM8_P31_S1	On June 15, 2016, the Company redeemed 10 percent of the face value of its outstanding Dividend Notes ($1,179,000) to note holders of record on June 2, 2016.
202947_17_ITEM8_P31_S2	At December 31, 2016, the remaining principal balance of the Dividend Notes is $10,608,000.
202947_17_ITEM8_P31_S3	On February 24, 2017, as a result of the sale of its petroleum storage business, the Company notified note holders that the entire remaining outstanding balance of its Dividend Notes would be redeemed on March 31, 2017.
202947_17_ITEM8_P32_S0	In December 2012, the Company and the Bank entered into an Amended and Restated Loan Agreement pursuant to which the Company refinanced the $2,700,000 balance of the 2010 debt to the Bank and borrowed an additional $3,025,000.
202947_17_ITEM8_P32_S1	In November 2015, the loan was paid in full.
202947_17_ITEM8_P32_S2	Financing fees totaling $71,000 were being amortized by the straight-line method over the 10-year term of the note.
202947_17_ITEM8_P32_S3	Upon the payment of the bank note in full in November 2015, the remaining financing fees were written off.
202947_17_ITEM8_P32_S4	For the year ended December 31, 2015, amortization of deferred financing fees included in interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statement of income and retained earnings totaled $57,000.
202947_17_ITEM8_P33_S0	Description of leasing arrangements: Long-term land leases: As of December 31, 2016, the Company had entered into nine long-term land leases.
202947_17_ITEM8_P33_S1	Of the nine parcels, seven have had improvements constructed thereon and construction has commenced on Parcel 6B. Under the nine land leases, the tenants are required to negotiate any tax stabilization treaty or other arrangements, appeal any changes in real property assessments, and pay real property taxes assessed on land and improvements under these arrangements.
202947_17_ITEM8_P33_S2	Accordingly, real property taxes payable by the tenants are excluded from leasing revenues and leasing expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of income and retained earnings.
202947_17_ITEM8_P33_S3	For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the real property taxes attributable to the Company s land under these nine leases were $1,212,000 and $951,000, respectively.
202947_17_ITEM8_P33_S4	Under two of the long-term land leases, the Company receives contingent rentals (based upon a fixed percentage of gross revenue received by the tenants) which totaled $105,000 and $104,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
202947_17_ITEM8_P33_S5	With respect to the Parcel 6B and 6C leases, each lessee has the right to terminate its lease at any time during the remaining term of that lease upon thirty days notice.
202947_17_ITEM8_P33_S6	To date, no notice of termination has been received by the Company.
202947_17_ITEM8_P34_S0	The current annual rents on Parcels 6B and 6C are $195,000 and $200,000, respectively.
202947_17_ITEM8_P35_S0	Lamar lease: The Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, leases 23 outdoor advertising locations containing 44 billboard faces along interstate and primary highways in Rhode Island and Massachusetts to Lamar under a lease which expires in 2045.
202947_17_ITEM8_P35_S1	All but one of these locations are controlled by the Company through permanent easements granted to the Company pursuant to an agreement between the Company and Providence Worcester Railroad Company; the remaining location is leased by the Company from a third party with a remaining term of three years.
202947_17_ITEM8_P36_S0	In 2013, Lamar converted billboards at two locations to electronic billboards, which conversions extended the term of the lease for a total of twelve years.
202947_17_ITEM8_P36_S1	The Lamar lease also provides, among other things, for the following: (1) the base rent increases annually at the rate of 2.75% for each leased billboard location on June 1 of each year, and (2) in addition to base rent, for each 12-month period commencing each June 1, Lamar must pay to the Company within thirty days after the close of the lease year 30% of the gross revenues from each standard billboard and 20% of the gross revenues from each electronic billboard for such 12-month period, reduced by the sum of (a) commissions paid to third parties and (b) base monthly rent for each leased billboard display for each 12-month period.
202947_17_ITEM8_P36_S2	For the lease years ended May 31, 2016 and 2015, the contingent rents totaled $117,000 and $155,000, respectively, which amounts are included in revenues on the accompanying consolidated statements of income and retained earnings for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
202947_17_ITEM8_P37_S0	The Lamar lease contains other terms and conditions customary to such instruments.
202947_17_ITEM8_P37_S1	Minimum future contractual rental payments to be received from non-cancellable long-term leases as of December 31, 2016 are:
202947_17_ITEM8_P38_S0	For those leases with presently known scheduled rent increases at December 31, 2016 and 2015, the cumulative excess of straight-line over contractual rentals (considering scheduled rent increases over the 30 to 149 year terms of the leases) and the portion of the excess of straight-line over contractual rentals which management has concluded is realizable when payable over the terms of the leases at December 31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows: In the event of tenant default, the Company has the right to reclaim its leased land together with any improvements thereon, subject to the right of any leasehold mortgagee to enter into a new lease with the Company with the same terms and conditions as the lease in default.
202947_17_ITEM8_P39_S0	Short-term leases: The Company leases the undeveloped parcels of land in or adjacent to the Capital Center area for public parking purposes to Metropark under a short-term cancellable lease.
202947_17_ITEM8_P39_S1	At December 31, 2016, the Company has three tenants occupying 54 percent of the Steeple Street Building under short-term leases of five years or less at a current total annual rental of $125,000.
202947_17_ITEM8_P39_S2	The Company is recognizing the revenue from these leases on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases.
202947_17_ITEM8_P39_S3	At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the excess of straight-line over contractual rentals is $1,000 for both years, which is included in prepaid and other on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
202947_17_ITEM8_P39_S4	The Company also reports as revenue from tenants reimbursements for common area costs and real property taxes.
202947_17_ITEM8_P39_S5	The Company is currently marketing the remaining portions of the building for lease.
202947_17_ITEM8_P39_S6	The following table sets forth those major tenants whose revenues exceed 10 percent of the Company s revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:
202947_17_ITEM8_P40_S0	On December 20, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors authorized the sale of the Company s petroleum storage facility and related assets to Sprague, which sale was completed on February 10, 2017.

202947_17_ITEM8_P42_S0	The Facility has been leased by Sprague under a Petroleum Storage Services Agreement (the Services Agreement ) since May 1, 2014.
202947_17_ITEM8_P42_S1	The base rent under the Services Agreement is $3,500,000, subject to annual cost-of-living adjustments on May 1 of each year.
202947_17_ITEM8_P42_S2	On May 1, 2016, the annual rent increased $39,000.
202947_17_ITEM8_P42_S3	There was no change in the base rent on May 1, 2015 because the cost-of-living decreased from May 1, 2014.
202947_17_ITEM8_P43_S0	Commencing April 1, 2016 and on each April 1 thereafter during the initial term and any extension term of the Services Agreement, either party during the following thirty days had the right to terminate the Services Agreement as of April 30 of the year next following the year in which notice of termination is given.
202947_17_ITEM8_P43_S1	On April 28, 2016, the Company received a notice from Sprague that, effective April 30, 2017, Sprague would terminate the Services Agreement.
202947_17_ITEM8_P44_S0	Commencing May 1, 2015, Sprague was obligated to reimburse the Company for any real property taxes in excess of $290,000.
202947_17_ITEM8_P44_S1	For the year 2016, there was an increase in the assessment but a decrease in the tax rate, resulting in no additional payment being due from Sprague.
202947_17_ITEM8_P44_S2	For the year 2015, there was no increase in the assessment or tax rate and therefore no additional payment was due from Sprague.
202947_17_ITEM8_P44_S3	The Company incurred $108,000 in fees in connection with the execution of the Services Agreement, which amounts were amortized on the straight-line method over the three-year non-cancellable portion of the term of the Services Agreement and have been deducted in calculating Income from discontinued operations before income taxes on the accompanying consolidated statements of income and retained earnings for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
202947_17_ITEM8_P45_S0	In 2002, during testing of monitoring wells at the Terminal, the Company s consulting engineer discovered free floating phase product in a groundwater monitoring well located on that portion of the Terminal purchased in 2000.
202947_17_ITEM8_P45_S1	Laboratory analysis indicated that the product was gasoline, which is not a product the Company ever stored at the Terminal.
202947_17_ITEM8_P45_S2	The Company commenced an environmental investigation and analysis, the results of which indicate that the gasoline did not come from the Terminal.
202947_17_ITEM8_P45_S3	The Company notified the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management ( RIDEM ).
202947_17_ITEM8_P45_S4	RIDEM subsequently identified Power Test Realty Partnership ( Power Test ), the owner of an adjacent parcel, as a potentially responsible party for the contamination.
202947_17_ITEM8_P45_S5	Getty Properties Corp. is the general partner of Power Test.
202947_17_ITEM8_P46_S0	Power Test challenged that determination and, after an administrative hearing, in October 2008 a RIDEM Hearing Officer determined that Power Test is responsible for the discharge of the petroleum product under the Rhode Island Oil Pollution Control Act, R.I.G.L. Section 46-12.5.1-3 and Rule 6(a) and 12(b) of the Oil Pollution Control Regulations.
202947_17_ITEM8_P46_S1	The RIDEM Decision and Order requires Power Test to remediate the contamination as directed by RIDEM and remanded the proposed penalty to RIDEM for recalculation.
202947_17_ITEM8_P46_S2	In November 2008, Power Test appealed the decision to the Rhode Island Superior Court and then to the Rhode Island Supreme Court.
202947_17_ITEM8_P46_S3	In March 2016, the Rhode Island Supreme Court affirmed the RIDEM decision.
202947_17_ITEM8_P47_S0	In April 2009, the Company sued Getty Properties Corp. (now Getty Realty Corp.) and certain other firms with respect to the gasoline discharge.
202947_17_ITEM8_P47_S1	All other parties other than the Company and Getty were dismissed from the proceeding.
202947_17_ITEM8_P48_S0	On September 12, 2016, the Company and Getty entered into a Tolling Agreement under which the statute of limitations is tolled to not later than sixty days following implementation by Power Test of RIDEM approved remediation plan.
202947_17_ITEM8_P48_S1	On September 19, 2016, the parties dismissed the litigation.
202947_17_ITEM8_P48_S2	Since January 2003, the Company has not incurred significant costs in connection with this matter, other than ongoing litigation costs.
202947_17_ITEM8_P49_S0	In 1994, a leak was discovered in a 25,000 barrel storage tank at the Terminal which allowed the escape of a small amount of fuel oil.
202947_17_ITEM8_P49_S1	All required notices were made to RIDEM.
202947_17_ITEM8_P49_S2	In 2000, the tank was demolished and testing of the groundwater indicated that there was no large pooling of contaminants.
202947_17_ITEM8_P50_S0	In 2001, RIDEM approved a plan pursuant to which the Company installed a passive system consisting of three wells and commenced monitoring the wells.
202947_17_ITEM8_P50_S1	In 2003, RIDEM decided that the passive monitoring system previously approved was not sufficient and required the Company to design an active remediation system for the removal of product from the contaminated site.
202947_17_ITEM8_P50_S2	The Company and its consulting engineers began the pre-design testing of the site in the fourth quarter of 2004.
202947_17_ITEM8_P51_S0	consulting engineers estimated a total cost of $200,000 to design, install and operate the system, which amount was accrued in 2004.
202947_17_ITEM8_P51_S1	Through 2006, the Company had expended $119,000 and has not incurred any significant costs since then.
202947_17_ITEM8_P51_S2	In 2011, RIDEM notified the Company to proceed with the next phase of the approval process, notifying the abutters of the proposed remediation system even though RIDEM has not yet taken any action on the Company s proposed plan.
202947_17_ITEM8_P52_S0	As designed, the system will pump out the contaminants which will be disposed of in compliance with applicable regulations.
202947_17_ITEM8_P52_S1	After a period of time, the groundwater will be tested to determine if sufficient contaminants have been removed.
202947_17_ITEM8_P52_S2	In 2014, the Company engaged new consultants to work with RIDEM to develop the next phase of the approval process.
202947_17_ITEM8_P52_S3	The Company and RIDEM are working to complete a remediation plan.
202947_17_ITEM8_P52_S4	Pursuant to the Sale Agreement and related documentation, the Company is required to secure an approved remediation plan and to remediate this contaminated site at its expense.
202947_17_ITEM8_P52_S5	At December 31, 2016, the Company accrued an additional $385,000 to cover these costs, bringing the total accrual for the cost of remediation to $459,000.
202947_17_ITEM8_P52_S6	Any subsequent increases or decreases to the expected cost of remediation will be recorded in the Company s consolidated income statement as income or expense from discontinued operations.
202947_17_ITEM8_P53_S0	Income taxes, continuing operations: For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, income tax expense (benefit) for continuing operations is comprised of the following components:
202947_17_ITEM8_P54_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, a reconciliation of the income tax provision for continuing operations as computed by applying the United States income tax rate (34%) to income before income taxes is as follows: Deferred income taxes are recorded based upon differences between financial statement and tax basis amounts of assets and liabilities.
202947_17_ITEM8_P54_S1	The tax effects of temporary differences for continuing operations which give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:
202947_17_ITEM8_P55_S0	The Company has reviewed all of its tax positions and has determined that no reserves are required.
202947_17_ITEM8_P55_S1	In 2014, Rhode Island changed the tax rate for corporate taxpayers from 9 percent to 7 percent effective January 1, 2015.
202947_17_ITEM8_P55_S2	The Company failed to adjust state deferred tax liability for the change at December 31, 2014.
202947_17_ITEM8_P55_S3	The Company recorded the adjustment in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, which decreased the deferred tax liability and increased shareholders equity, the deferred tax benefit and net income by $163,000 and decrease its effective tax rate from 39 percent to 34 percent.
202947_17_ITEM8_P56_S0	Related party transaction: Prior to November 2016, the Company and Providence and Worcester Railroad Company ( the Railroad ) had a common controlling shareholder.
202947_17_ITEM8_P56_S1	On November 1, 2016, pursuant to a Merger Agreement between the Railroad and Genesee Wyoming Railroad Company ( G W ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of G W was merged with and into the Railroad.
202947_17_ITEM8_P56_S2	All of the Railroad s shareholders immediately prior to the merger received cash for their shares and are no longer shareholders of the Railroad.
202947_17_ITEM8_P56_S3	Accordingly, the Railroad and the Company are no longer related parties.
202947_17_ITEM8_P57_S0	In May 2012, the Company and the Railroad entered into a License Agreement licensing to the Company track facilities which may be installed in connection with a railcar-loading/unloading facility upon the Railroad s right-of-way.
202947_17_ITEM8_P57_S1	The License Agreement continues through December 31, 2015, and thereafter is extended for additional three-year periods unless cancelled by the Company upon thirty days written notice prior to termination.
202947_17_ITEM8_P57_S2	The Company did not cancel the License Agreement and it is therefore extended to December 31, 2018.
202947_17_ITEM8_P58_S0	Discontinued operations: On December 20, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors voted to authorize the sale of its East Providence petroleum storage facility and related assets, including the Pier and petroleum transmission pipelines owned or controlled by its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Capital Terminal Company ( CTC ) and Dunellen, LLC ( Dunellen ) ( Petroleum Segment ).
202947_17_ITEM8_P58_S1	The decision to authorize the sale of the Petroleum Segment to Sprague, which has been exclusively leasing the property since May 1, 2014, was partly based on an evaluation of the Petroleum Segment s economic future as solely a distillate terminal and the significant capital investment and substantial risk related to converting a significant portion of the petroleum storage facility to gasoline in order to increase revenue.
202947_17_ITEM8_P58_S2	The Board concluded that under the circumstances a sale to Sprague was in the best interest of the Company s shareholders.
202947_17_ITEM8_P59_S0	In accordance with ASC 205-20, Presentation of Financial Statements Discontinued Operations the Petroleum Segment will be accounted for as a discontinued operation.
202947_17_ITEM8_P59_S1	Accordingly, the Petroleum Segment assets and liabilities that will be sold are recorded as held for sale.
202947_17_ITEM8_P59_S2	The liabilities associated with the discontinued operations are also separately identified on the Company s consolidated balance sheets; however, these liabilities are not being assumed by Sprague and remain obligations of the Company until settled.
202947_17_ITEM8_P59_S3	The Petroleum Segment discontinued operations are reported after income from continuing operations.
202947_17_ITEM8_P59_S4	A reconciliation of the major classes of assets reported held for sale as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: A reconciliation of the major classes of liabilities associated with the discontinued operations as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:
202947_17_ITEM8_P60_S0	The operating results of the Petroleum Segment, including those related to prior years, have been retrospectively adjusted from continuing operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and retained earnings.
202947_17_ITEM8_P60_S1	Revenue and income before income taxes attributable to discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:
202947_17_ITEM8_P61_S0	On January 24, 2017, the Company and Sprague enter into an asset purchase agreement (the Sale Agreement ) for the sale of the Petroleum Segment for a price of $23 Million (the Purchase Price ).
202947_17_ITEM8_P61_S1	Sprague received a credit against the Purchase Price in the amount $1,040,000, representing the estimated cost to construct a turning dolphin adjacent to the Pier in order that the Pier can berth Panamax sized vessels.
202947_17_ITEM8_P61_S2	In addition, 7.5 percent of the Purchase Price ($1,725,000) is held in escrow for any potential breaches in the Company s representations, warranties and covenants.
202947_17_ITEM8_P61_S3	Provided there are no breaches, the escrow will be returned to the Company, 50 percent after 12 months and the remainder after 24 months.
202947_17_ITEM8_P61_S4	In accordance with the Sale Agreement, the Company has agreed to retain and pay for the environmental remediation costs associated with a 1994 storage tank fuel oil leak.
202947_17_ITEM8_P61_S5	This obligation and the estimated cost are disclosed in Note 6 herein.
202947_17_ITEM8_P61_S6	The sale closed on February 10, 2017; and after adjustment for the turning dolphin construction holdback, other closing costs and the escrow, the net proceeds delivered to the Company amounted to $19.8 Million.
202947_17_ITEM8_P62_S0	Under Section 5 of the Company s outstanding 5% Dividend Notes Due 2022 (the Dividend Notes ), upon the sale of all or any portion of the Company s real property or the real property of any Company subsidiary, the Company is required, within 90 days from the Closing Date, to redeem that amount of the Notes at a redemption price equal to the maximum amount of the Net Proceeds from the sale of the real property.

202947_17_ITEM8_P62_S2	On February 24, 2017 the Company issued a notice of mandatory redemption of 100% of the Dividend Notes on March 31, 2017 for a redemption price equal to the outstanding principal face amount of $10,608,000 plus accrued interest of $156,000.
202947_17_ITEM8_P63_S0	In connection with the sale of the Petroleum Segment described above, the Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of Directors approved a bonus for the Company s Vice-President in the amount of one year s salary ($191,000).
202947_17_ITEM8_P63_S1	This bonus was conditioned on the successful completion of the sale.
202947_17_ITEM8_P63_S2	In addition to the Vice President s bonus, the Board of Directors approved bonuses totaling $235,000 to be paid to the remaining seven Petroleum Segment employees for their dedicated service over a combined 94 years ($2,500 for each year of service).
202947_17_ITEM8_P63_S3	The bonuses to the Vice President and the employees did not become due until the sale became final and the Company received the net proceeds.
202947_17_ITEM8_P63_S4	Accordingly, the associated expense will be recorded in the first quarter of 2017.
202947_17_ITEM9_P0_S0	There were no changes in, or disagreements with, accountants on accounting or financial disclosure as defined by Item 304 of Regulation S-K.
202947_17_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Under the supervision of the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report.
202947_17_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of such date, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in making them aware on a timely basis of the material information relating to the Company required to be included in the Company s periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
202947_17_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act).
202947_17_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Company s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of its financial reporting and the preparation of published financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.
202947_17_ITEM9A_P1_S2	However, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
202947_17_ITEM9A_P1_S3	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
202947_17_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies may deteriorate.
202947_17_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management conducted its evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) as of December 31, 2016.
202947_17_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Based on this assessment, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer believe that as of December 31, 2016, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on criteria set forth by COSO in 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework.
202947_17_ITEM9A_P2_S2	This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
202947_17_ITEM9A_P2_S3	Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report.
202947_17_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting During the quarter ended December 31, 2016, there has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

(the Company) on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof (the Report), I, Barbara J.

202947_17_ITEM15_P10_S0	(2) The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
202947_18_ITEM1_P0_S0	Organizational History The Company was organized as a business corporation under the laws of Rhode Island in 1983 as Providence and Worcester Company and is the successor by merger in 1983 to a corporation also named Providence and Worcester Company which was organized under the laws of Delaware in 1979.
202947_18_ITEM1_P0_S1	In 1984, the Company s name was changed to Capital Properties, Inc.
202947_18_ITEM1_P1_S0	Segments Prior to December 20, 2016, the Company operated in two segments: leasing and petroleum storage.
202947_18_ITEM1_P2_S0	On December 20, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors authorized the sale of the Company s petroleum storage facility and related assets, including the Wilkesbarre Pier and petroleum transmission pipelines owned or controlled by the Company s subsidiaries, Capital Terminal Company and Dunellen, LLC to Sprague Operating Resources, LLC, a subsidiary of Sprague Resources LP (collectively referred to as Sprague ), for a purchase price of $23 Million (subject to certain adjustments) resulting in the petroleum storage business (the Petroleum Segment ) being classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
202947_18_ITEM1_P2_S1	On January 24, 2017, the Company entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement with Sprague (the Sale Agreement ) and the transaction was consummated on February 10, 2017.
202947_18_ITEM1_P2_S2	See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
202947_18_ITEM1_P3_S0	The Board s decision to authorize the sale of the Petroleum Segment to Sprague, which had been exclusively leasing the petroleum storage facility and related assets since May 1, 2014, was based on an evaluation of the Petroleum Segment s economic future as solely a distillate terminal and the significant capital investment and substantial risk related to converting a significant portion of the petroleum storage facility to gasoline in order to increase revenue.
202947_18_ITEM1_P3_S1	The Board concluded that a sale to Sprague was in the best interest of the Company s shareholders.
202947_18_ITEM1_P3_S2	As a result of the sale of its petroleum storage and related assets, the Company s operations are limited to leasing its real estate interests.
202947_18_ITEM1_P4_S0	Leasing Business Capital Center The Company s principal business is the leasing of Company-owned land in the Capital Center area ( Capital Center ) in downtown Providence, Rhode Island under long-term ground leases.
202947_18_ITEM1_P4_S1	The Company owns approximately 18 acres in the Capital Center consisting of 13 individual parcels.
202947_18_ITEM1_P5_S0	The Capital Center (approximately 77 acres of land) is the result of a development project undertaken by the State of Rhode Island, the City of Providence, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation ( Amtrak ) and the Company during the 1980 s in which two rivers, the Moshassuck and the Woonasquatucket, were moved, Amtrak s Northeast Corridor rail line was relocated, a new Amtrak/commuter railroad station was constructed and significant public improvements were made to improve pedestrian and vehicular traffic in the area.
202947_18_ITEM1_P6_S0	With the exception of the Steeple Street property (see Parcel 20 defined below), the Company has not acted, and does not intend to act, as a developer with respect to any improvements constructed on Company-owned parcels.
202947_18_ITEM1_P6_S1	Rather, the Company offers individual parcels for lease pursuant to long-term ground leases with terms of 99 years or more.
202947_18_ITEM1_P6_S2	Each lease contains provisions permitting the tenant to develop the parcel under certain terms and conditions.
202947_18_ITEM1_P6_S3	Each lease provides for periodic rent adjustments of various kinds.
202947_18_ITEM1_P7_S0	Under the leases, the tenants are responsible for insuring the Company against various hazards and events.
202947_18_ITEM1_P7_S1	Each tenant is required to indemnify the Company with respect to all of the tenant s activities on the land.
202947_18_ITEM1_P7_S2	The leases contain other terms and conditions customary to such instruments.
202947_18_ITEM1_P8_S0	The Company first began offering parcels for lease in the Capital Center area in the late 1980 s.
202947_18_ITEM1_P8_S1	As of December 31, 2017, nine parcels within the Capital Center area have been leased by the Company under long-term leases of 99 years or more.
202947_18_ITEM1_P8_S2	Of the nine parcels, eight have improvements constructed thereon or under construction as follows:
202947_18_ITEM1_P9_S0	While seeking developers, the Company also leases Parcels 3E, 3W, 4E and 4W in the Capital Center area for public parking purposes on a short-term basis to Metropark, Ltd.
202947_18_ITEM1_P10_S0	Parcel 20 Adjacent to the Capital Center Since the 1980 s, the Company has owned an undeveloped parcel of land adjacent to the Capital Center, which is leased out for public parking purposes on a short-term basis.
202947_18_ITEM1_P10_S1	In 2007, the Company purchased the adjacent parcel containing a three/four-story 18,000 square foot building (the Steeple Street Building ) and related land for $2,329,000, which, together with the previously-owned land, now comprises Parcel 20, containing 26,600 square feet.
202947_18_ITEM1_P10_S2	The Steeple Street Building is on the State Registry of Historic Buildings.
202947_18_ITEM1_P11_S0	During 2010-2011, the Company substantially rehabilitated the Steeple Street Building.
202947_18_ITEM1_P12_S0	The Steeple Street Building has four commercial tenants with additional space available for lease.
202947_18_ITEM1_P12_S1	On September 28, 2017 the Company entered into a long-term ground lease of Parcel 20.
202947_18_ITEM1_P12_S2	Under the terms of the lease, tenant possession will not occur until such time as the tenant has received all necessary approvals for construction of not less than 100,000 square feet of mixed use improvements.
202947_18_ITEM1_P12_S3	Prior to transfer of possession, no rent is being paid by the tenant and the Company receives all rents from existing tenants and parking lease revenue and remains responsible for all expenses, including real estate taxes, related to Parcel 20.
202947_18_ITEM1_P12_S4	Following tenant possession, tenant is obligated not only to pay ground rent for the parcel but also to pay the Company an additional amount for twenty years to compensate the Company for the building presently located on the premises.
202947_18_ITEM1_P13_S0	All of the properties described above are shown on a map contained in Exhibit 20.
202947_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	Lamar Lease The Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, leases 23 outdoor advertising locations containing 44 billboard faces along interstate and primary highways in Rhode Island and Massachusetts to Lamar Outdoor Advertising, LLC ( Lamar ) under a lease which expires in 2045.
202947_18_ITEM1_P14_S1	All but one of these locations are controlled by the Company through permanent easements granted to the Company pursuant to an agreement between the Company and Providence Worcester Railroad Company ( Railroad the remaining location is leased by the Company from a third party with a remaining term of two years.
202947_18_ITEM1_P14_S2	Although no new locations have been added since 2002, in 2013 Lamar converted billboards at two locations to electronic boards, which conversions extended the term of the lease for a total of twelve years to 2045.
202947_18_ITEM1_P14_S3	Lamar has a right of first refusal for additional billboard location sites acquired by the Company in New England and Metropolitan New York City.
202947_18_ITEM1_P14_S4	The lease with Lamar provides, among other things, for the following: (1) the base rent increases annually at the rate of 2.75% for each leased billboard location commencing June 1, 2006 and on each June 1 thereafter; and (2) in addition to base rent, for each 12-month period commencing each June 1, Lamar must pay to the Company 30% of the gross revenues from each standard billboard and 20% of the gross revenues from each electronic billboard for such 12-month period, reduced by the sum of (a) commissions paid to third parties and (b) the base monthly rent for each leased billboard display for such 12-month period.
202947_18_ITEM1_P14_S5	The Lamar lease contains other terms and conditions customary to such instruments.
202947_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	A summary of the long-term leases which have commenced is as follows:
202947_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
202947_18_ITEM1_P17_S0	Major tenants: The following table sets forth those major tenants whose revenues exceed 10 percent of the Company s leasing revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:
202947_18_ITEM1_P18_S0	Competition The Company competes for tenants with other owners of undeveloped real property in downtown Providence.
202947_18_ITEM1_P18_S1	The Company maintains no listing of other competitive properties and will not engage in a competitive bid arrangement with proposed developers.
202947_18_ITEM1_P18_S2	The Company s refusal to sell the land that it owns may restrict the number of interested developers.
202947_18_ITEM1_P18_S3	As to the Steeple Street Building, the Company competes for tenants with other office and commercial buildings located in downtown Providence.
202947_18_ITEM1_P19_S0	As of December 31, 2017, the Company has four employees.
202947_18_ITEM1_P20_S0	Prior to February 10, 2017, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Dunellen, LLC ( Dunellen ) and Capital Terminal Company, owned and operated a petroleum storage terminal containing 1,004,000 shell barrels (the Terminal ) and the Wilkesbarre Pier (the Pier ), collectively referred to as the Facility, located in East Providence, Rhode Island.
202947_18_ITEM1_P20_S1	The Terminal utilized the Pier and two 16 pipelines connecting the Pier to the Terminal.
202947_18_ITEM1_P20_S2	During 2016, the Facility was leased to Sprague pursuant to a lease dated May 1, 2014.
202947_18_ITEM1_P20_S3	Sprague paid an annual rent of $3,500,000 and the Company paid substantially all of the operating costs related to the Facility.
202947_18_ITEM1_P20_S4	In April 2016, as permitted by the lease, Sprague gave Dunellen notice of its intention to terminate the lease effective May 1, 2017.
202947_18_ITEM1_P20_S5	In January 2017, the Company took title to the pipelines and the related easement from Getty Properties Corp. ( Getty ).
202947_18_ITEM1_P20_S6	Getty also conveyed to Dunellen all of its interest in and to the Pier.
202947_18_ITEM1_P20_S7	As noted above, on February 10, 2017, the Company sold the Terminal, the Pier and related facilities, including the pipelines, to Sprague.
202947_18_ITEM1_P20_S8	See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
202947_18_ITEM1_P21_S0	In 1994, a leak was discovered in a storage tank at the Terminal which allowed the escape of a small amount of fuel oil.
202947_18_ITEM1_P21_S1	Since that time, the Company and its consultants have continued to worked with the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management ( RIDEM ) through the various phases of remediation and are now working to complete the final remediation plan.
202947_18_ITEM1_P21_S2	Pursuant to the Sale Agreement with Sprague and related documentation, the Company is required to secure an approved remediation plan and to remediate this contaminated site at its expense.
202947_18_ITEM1_P21_S3	At December 31, 2016, the Company accrued an additional $385,000 to cover these costs, bringing the total accrual for the cost of remediation to $459,000.
202947_18_ITEM1_P21_S4	During 2017, remediation costs of $25,000 were incurred which reduced the total accrual to $434,000.
202947_18_ITEM1_P21_S5	Any subsequent increases or decreases to the expected cost of remediation will be recorded in the Company s consolidated income statement as income or expense from discontinued operations.
202947_18_ITEM1_P22_S0	Insurance The Company maintains what management believes to be adequate levels of insurance.
202947_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	owns approximately 18 acres and a historic building in and adjacent to the Capital Center District in Providence, Rhode Island.
202947_18_ITEM2_P0_S1	All of the property and a portion of the building are leased either under long-term leases or short-term leases as more particularly described in Item 1, Leasing Business.
202947_18_ITEM2_P0_S2	The Company also owns or controls 23 locations on which 44 billboard faces have been constructed.
202947_18_ITEM2_P0_S3	All but one of these locations are owned by the Company under permanent easements from the Railroad; the remaining location is leased from an unrelated third party with a remaining term of two years.
202947_18_ITEM2_P0_S4	As of December 31, 2016, the Company also owned the Pier and an approximate 10-acre site in East Providence, Rhode Island on which there are located nine petroleum storage tanks, related distribution racks and a single-story office building which housed the Company s headquarters and other support operations.
202947_18_ITEM2_P0_S5	On December 20, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized the sale of these properties to Sprague.
202947_18_ITEM2_P0_S6	Accordingly, these properties were reclassified as Assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the year ended December 31, 2016.
202947_18_ITEM2_P0_S7	The properties were sold to Sprague on February 10, 2017.
202947_18_ITEM2_P1_S0	See Discontinued Operations above and Note 8 to Consolidated Financial Statements.
202947_18_ITEM5_P0_S0	during the quarterly periods indicated as obtained from the OTCQX, together with cash dividends paid per share during such periods.
202947_18_ITEM5_P1_S0	At March 1, 2018, there were 395 holders of record of the Company s Class A Common Stock.
202947_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U. S. GAAP).
202947_18_ITEM7_P0_S1	The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations excludes the results of our discontinued operations unless otherwise noted.
202947_18_ITEM7_P0_S2	See Note 8, Discontinued Operations and Subsequent Event in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these operations.
202947_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	Critical accounting policies: The Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) has issued guidance for the disclosure of critical accounting policies.
202947_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	The SEC defines such policies as those that require application of management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.
202947_18_ITEM7_P1_S2	The Company s significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
202947_18_ITEM7_P1_S3	Not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates.
202947_18_ITEM7_P1_S4	Management believes that the Company s revenue recognition policy for long-term leases with scheduled rent increases meets the SEC definition of critical.
202947_18_ITEM7_P1_S5	Certain of the Company s long-term land leases have original terms of 30 to 149 years and contain scheduled rent increases where the future dollar increases are known at the time of the commencement of the lease or at a subsequent date.
202947_18_ITEM7_P1_S6	The first such lease commenced in 1988, had an original term of 99 years and provides for fixed percentage increases at specified intervals (as well as reappraisal increases).
202947_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	In accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) in accounting for leases, rental income related to the fixed percentage increases that are presently known should be recognized on a straight-line basis.
202947_18_ITEM7_P2_S1	To calculate the annual straight-line amount, the 99 known annual rental amounts are totaled and this total is divided by 99.
202947_18_ITEM7_P2_S2	In 2009, a scheduled appraisal occurred, resulting in a rental increase.
202947_18_ITEM7_P2_S3	The Company recalculated the future annual straight-line amount using the remaining years under the lease.
202947_18_ITEM7_P2_S4	The turnaround date discussed below did not change.
202947_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	For this lease, the calculated annual straight-line amount for 1988 was eight times (multiple) the amount paid by the tenant under the terms of the lease (the contractual amount ).
202947_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	In subsequent years, as the tenant pays higher rents, the multiple gradually decreases until the 57 th year of the lease, at which time the contractual amount paid by the tenant will exceed the calculated straight-line amount.
202947_18_ITEM7_P3_S2	If the Company were to report annual revenue for this lease using the straight-line amount, it would record a significant receivable for each of the first 56 years, which receivable would grow to approximately $34,000,000.
202947_18_ITEM7_P3_S3	Management does not believe that the Company should record a receivable that would not begin to be collected until the 56 th year (the turnaround date ) since management could not be assured of collection.
202947_18_ITEM7_P3_S4	In 1988, management met with the SEC accounting staff to discuss its concerns in applying GAAP as it related to a lease of this length which results in the recording of such a significant receivable that would remain on the Company s balance sheet and continue to grow on an annual basis with a turnaround date so far in the future.
202947_18_ITEM7_P3_S5	The Company presented the SEC accounting staff with an application of the accounting policy whereby management would evaluate the collectibility of the receivable on an annual basis and report as leasing revenue only that portion of the receivable that management could presently conclude would be collectible.
202947_18_ITEM7_P3_S6	The SEC accounting staff did not object to this application by the Company.
202947_18_ITEM7_P3_S7	Through December 31, 2017, the receivable on this lease has grown to $23,885,000 (cumulative excess of straight-line over contractual rentals) and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround date is still 28 years away.
202947_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	In 2004, a second such lease commenced with an original term of 149 years and provides for fixed minimum percentage increases at specified intervals (as well as reappraisal increases).
202947_18_ITEM7_P4_S1	For this lease, the contractual amount paid by the tenant will not exceed the calculated straight-line amount until the 94 th year of the lease.
202947_18_ITEM7_P4_S2	Through December 31, 2017, the receivable on this lease is $30,844,000 (cumulative excess of straight-line over contractual rentals) and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround date is 80 years away.
202947_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	In 2006, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Agreement of its lease with Lamar Outdoor Advertising LLC ( Lamar ).
202947_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	In 2013, the lease was extended to 2045 following the conversion of billboards at two locations to electronic boards, as required by the lease, resulting in a current remaining term of 30 years which provides for fixed percentage increases annually.
202947_18_ITEM7_P5_S2	For this lease, the contractual amount paid by Lamar will not exceed the calculated straight-line amount until the 23rd year of the extended lease.
202947_18_ITEM7_P5_S3	Through December 31, 2017, the receivable on this lease is $2,788,000 (cumulative excess of straight-line over contractual rentals) and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround date is 12 years away.
202947_18_ITEM7_P5_S4	Accordingly, the Company has not reported any portion of these amounts as leasing revenue in its consolidated financial statements and does not anticipate that it can reach such a conclusion until the turnaround dates are closer.
202947_18_ITEM7_P5_S5	Although the Company s other long-term land leases provide for scheduled rent increases, the provisions of the leases are such that certain future dollar amounts could not be calculated either at the time of the commencement of the lease or now, as such amounts are based on factors that are not presently known, i.e., future cost-of-living adjustments or future appraised values.
202947_18_ITEM7_P5_S6	Through December 31, 2017, the receivable on these leases is $16,120,000 and management has not been able to conclude that any portion is collectible as the turnaround dates are approximately 43 years away.
202947_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	Liquidity and capital resources: Historically, the Company generates adequate liquidity to fund its operations.
202947_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	Cash and cash commitments: At December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $5,202,000.
202947_18_ITEM7_P6_S2	At December 31, 2017, cash equivalents consist of United States zero-coupon treasury bills due March 2018 totaling $2,993,000.

Results of operations: Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016 Continuing operations: Revenues from continuing operations increased $129,000 from 2016 due to scheduled increases in rent under long-term land leases and increases under short-term leases, offset in part by a decrease in contingent rent under the Lamar lease.
202947_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	Operating expenses increased $479,000 due principally to a review of tenant compliance with the insurance requirements provided in the long-term land leases ($187,000), legal costs associated with review of potential development opportunities on the Company s available parcels and the eviction of a Steeple Street tenant due to nonpayment of rent and common area charges ($75,000), bad debt expense ($64,000) in connection with the evicted tenant and an increase in repairs and maintenance at the Steeple Street Building ($61,000).

202947_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	For 2017, revenues and operating expenses reflect the results of operations through the date of sale (February 10, 2017) verses a full year of activity in 2016.
202947_18_ITEM7_P14_S2	Revenues for 2017 are less than the revenue earned from the same time frame in 2016 due principally to an adjustment of $50,000 related to the recognition of revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the Sprague lease.
202947_18_ITEM7_P14_S3	Operating expenses for 2017 include bonuses totaling $426,000 paid to the Company s former Vice President and Petroleum Segment employees for the successful completion of the sale to Sprague and for their dedicated service along with increased professional fees associated with the Sprague sale.

202947_18_ITEM8_P5_S0	Description of business: Capital Properties, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Tri-State Displays, Inc., Capital Terminal Company and Dunellen, LLC (collectively referred to as the Company ) for many years operated in two segments, leasing and petroleum storage.
202947_18_ITEM8_P6_S0	On December 20, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors authorized the sale of the Company s petroleum storage facility and related assets, including the Wilkesbarre Pier and petroleum transmission pipelines owned or controlled by the Company s subsidiaries Capital Terminal Company and Dunellen, LLC to Sprague Operating Resources, LLC, a subsidiary of Sprague Resources, LP (collectively referred to as Sprague ) for $23 Million subject to certain adjustments.
202947_18_ITEM8_P6_S1	The Company concluded that the sale of the petroleum storage facility met the criteria of a discontinued operation in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) and therefore the petroleum storage segment is reported as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.
202947_18_ITEM8_P6_S2	On January 24, 2017, the Company and Sprague entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement (the Sale Agreement ).
202947_18_ITEM8_P6_S3	The sale closed on February 10, 2017.
202947_18_ITEM8_P6_S4	The Board s decision to authorize the sale to Sprague, which had been exclusively leasing the petroleum storage facility and related assets since May 1, 2014, was based on an evaluation of the facility s economic future as solely a distillate terminal and the significant capital investment and substantial risk related to converting the facility to gasoline in order to increase revenue.
202947_18_ITEM8_P6_S5	The Board concluded that a sale to Sprague was in the best interest of the Company s shareholders.
202947_18_ITEM8_P6_S6	As a result of the sale of its petroleum storage and related assets, the Company s operations are limited to leasing its real estate interests.
202947_18_ITEM8_P6_S7	The Company s continuing operations consist of the long-term leasing of certain of its real estate interests in downtown Providence, Rhode Island (upon the commencement of which the tenants have been required to construct buildings thereon, with the exception of the parking garage and Parcel 6C), the leasing of a portion of its building ( Steeple Street Building ) under short-term leasing arrangements and the leasing of locations along interstate and primary highways in Rhode Island and Massachusetts to Lamar Outdoor Advertising, LLC ( Lamar ) which has constructed outdoor advertising boards thereon.
202947_18_ITEM8_P6_S8	The Company anticipates that the future development of its remaining properties in and adjacent to the Capital Center area will consist primarily of long-term ground leases.
202947_18_ITEM8_P6_S9	Pending this development, the Company leases these parcels for public parking under short-term leasing arrangements to Metropark.
202947_18_ITEM8_P7_S0	Summary of significant accounting policies: Principles of consolidation: The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts and transactions of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
202947_18_ITEM8_P7_S1	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
202947_18_ITEM8_P8_S0	Use of estimates: The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.
202947_18_ITEM8_P8_S1	Estimates also affect the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.
202947_18_ITEM8_P8_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
202947_18_ITEM8_P9_S0	Fair value of financial instruments: The Company believes that the fair values of its financial instruments, including cash and payables, approximate their respective book values because of their short-term nature.
202947_18_ITEM8_P9_S1	Upon review of current market conditions and other factors, the Company believes that the fair value of the Dividends Notes payable at December 31, 2016 approximated their book value.
202947_18_ITEM8_P9_S2	The fair values described herein were determined using significant other observable inputs (Level 2) as defined by GAAP.
202947_18_ITEM8_P10_S0	Properties and equipment: Properties and equipment are stated at cost.
202947_18_ITEM8_P10_S1	Acquisitions and additions are capitalized while routine maintenance and repairs, which do not improve the asset or extend its life, are charged to expense when incurred.
202947_18_ITEM8_P10_S2	Depreciation is being provided by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.
202947_18_ITEM8_P11_S0	The Company reviews properties and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value of the asset may not be recoverable.
202947_18_ITEM8_P11_S1	An impairment loss will be recognized if the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and before interest) from the use of the asset is less than the net book value of the asset.
202947_18_ITEM8_P11_S2	Generally, the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the estimated fair value of the asset.
202947_18_ITEM8_P12_S0	Cash and cash equivalents: The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
202947_18_ITEM8_P12_S1	At December 31, 2017, cash equivalents consist of United States zero-coupon treasury bills due March 2018 totaling $2,993,000.
202947_18_ITEM8_P12_S2	At December 31, 2016, the Company had no cash equivalents.
202947_18_ITEM8_P13_S0	The Company and its three subsidiary companies each maintain a checking account in the same bank; the aggregate of each Company s accounts is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to a maximum of $250,000.
202947_18_ITEM8_P13_S1	The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.
202947_18_ITEM8_P14_S0	Initial direct agreement costs: Initial direct agreement costs associated with the execution of a rental agreement are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable portion of the agreement term.
202947_18_ITEM8_P15_S0	Environmental incidents: The Company accrues a liability when an environmental incident has occurred and the costs are estimable.
202947_18_ITEM8_P15_S1	The Company does not record a receivable for recoveries from third parties for environmental matters until it has determined that the amount of the collection is reasonably assured.
202947_18_ITEM8_P15_S2	The accrued liability is relieved when the Company pays the liability or a third party assumes the liability.
202947_18_ITEM8_P15_S3	Upon determination that collection is reasonably assured or a third party assumes the liability, the Company records the amount as a reduction of expense.
202947_18_ITEM8_P16_S0	The Company charges to expense those costs that do not extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of the property owned or used by the Company.
202947_18_ITEM8_P17_S0	Revenues: The Company s properties leased to others are under operating leases.
202947_18_ITEM8_P17_S1	The Company reports leasing revenue when earned under the operating method.
202947_18_ITEM8_P17_S2	Certain of the Company s long-term land leases, including the outdoor advertising locations, provide for presently known scheduled rent increases over the remaining terms (28 to 136 years).
202947_18_ITEM8_P17_S3	The Company follows GAAP in accounting for leases by recognizing leasing revenue on the straight-line basis over the terms of the leases; however, the Company does not report as revenue that portion of such straight-line rentals which management is unable to conclude is realizable (collectible) due to the length of the lease terms and other related uncertainties.
202947_18_ITEM8_P17_S4	The Company reports contingent revenue in the period in which the factors occur on which the contingent payments are predicated.
202947_18_ITEM8_P17_S5	The Company reported revenue from the petroleum storage facility included in discontinued operations when earned and reports as revenue the tenant s portion of the real property taxes and certain other items as required by the lease.
202947_18_ITEM8_P18_S0	Income taxes: The Company and its subsidiaries file consolidated income tax returns.
202947_18_ITEM8_P18_S1	The Company provides for income taxes based on income reported for financial reporting purposes.
202947_18_ITEM8_P18_S2	The provision for income taxes differs from the amounts currently payable because of temporary differences associated with the recognition of certain income and expense items for financial reporting and tax reporting purposes.
202947_18_ITEM8_P19_S0	In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act ) was enacted.
202947_18_ITEM8_P19_S1	The Act includes a number of changes to existing U.S. federal tax laws that impact the Company, most notably a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35 percent to a flat 21 percent for tax years effective January 1, 2018.
202947_18_ITEM8_P20_S0	No. 118 (SAB 118), which provides guidance for the application of ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes , in the reporting period in which the Act was signed into law.
202947_18_ITEM8_P20_S1	Under SAB 118 when the Company does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act it will recognize provisional amounts if a reasonable estimate can be made.
202947_18_ITEM8_P20_S2	If a reasonable estimate cannot be made, then no impact is recognized for the effect of the Act.
202947_18_ITEM8_P20_S3	SAB 118 permits an up to one year measurement period to finalize the measurement of the impact of the Act.
202947_18_ITEM8_P20_S4	Based on its evaluation, the Company has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the consolidated financial statements.
202947_18_ITEM8_P20_S5	The Company will report any tax-related interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.
202947_18_ITEM8_P21_S0	The Company s federal and state income tax returns are generally open for examination for the past three years.
202947_18_ITEM8_P22_S0	Legal fees: The Company recognizes legal fees as incurred.
202947_18_ITEM8_P23_S0	Basic earnings per common share: Basic earnings per common share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
202947_18_ITEM8_P24_S0	Recent accounting pronouncements: In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing all lease transactions (with terms in excess of 12 months) on the balance sheet as a lease liability and a right-of-use asset (as defined).
202947_18_ITEM8_P24_S1	The ASU requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases.
202947_18_ITEM8_P24_S2	The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier application permitted.
202947_18_ITEM8_P24_S3	Upon adoption, the lessee and lessor will apply the new standard retrospectively to all periods presented or retrospectively using a cumulative effect adjustment in the year of adoption.
202947_18_ITEM8_P24_S4	The Company is still assessing the impact of adopting the ASU but expects that its leases where it is the lessor will be accounted for as operating leases similar to its current accounting.
202947_18_ITEM8_P24_S5	For additional information on the Company s leases, see Note 5 herein.
202947_18_ITEM8_P25_S0	Properties and equipment: Properties and equipment (exclusive of assets held for sale) consist of the following:
202947_18_ITEM8_P26_S0	In 2016, the Company wrote off fully depreciated equipment no longer in service totaling $17,000.
202947_18_ITEM8_P27_S0	Dividend notes payable: In 2012, the Company issued $11,787,000 in principal face amount of 5% dividend notes due December 26, 2022 (the Dividend Notes ).
202947_18_ITEM8_P27_S1	The Dividend Notes were unsecured general obligations of the Company bearing interest at the annual rate of 5% payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 to note holders of record on June 1 and December 1 of each year.
202947_18_ITEM8_P27_S2	On June 15, 2016, the Company redeemed 10 percent of the face value of its outstanding Dividend Notes ($1,179,000) to note holders of record on June 2, 2016.
202947_18_ITEM8_P27_S3	At December 31, 2016, the remaining principal balance of the Dividend Notes was $10,608,000.
202947_18_ITEM8_P27_S4	On February 24, 2017, following the sale of the Company s petroleum storage business (see Note 8 herein), the Company issued a notice of mandatory redemption of 100% of the remaining Dividend Notes for a redemption price equal to the outstanding principal face amount of $10,608,000 plus accrued interest of $156,000.
202947_18_ITEM8_P27_S5	The Notes were redeemed on March 31, 2017.
202947_18_ITEM8_P28_S0	Description of leasing arrangements: Long-term land leases: As of December 31, 2017, the Company had entered into nine long-term land leases.
202947_18_ITEM8_P28_S1	The various tenants have completed construction of improvements on seven of the parcels.
202947_18_ITEM8_P28_S2	On Parcel 6B, construction of a 169-unit residential complex commenced in November 2016 and is not yet complete.
202947_18_ITEM8_P28_S3	Parcel 6C is being used as a construction staging area for the construction on Parcel 6B. On September 28, 2017, the Company entered into a long term ground lease of Parcel 20.
202947_18_ITEM8_P28_S4	Under the terms of the lease, tenant possession will not occur until such time as the tenant has received all necessary approvals for construction of not less than 100,000 square feet of mixed use improvements.
202947_18_ITEM8_P28_S5	Prior to transfer of possession, no rent is being paid by the tenant and the Company receives all rents from existing tenants and parking lease revenue and remains responsible for all expenses, including real estate taxes, related to Parcel 20.
202947_18_ITEM8_P28_S6	Following tenant possession, tenant is obligated not only to pay ground rent for the parcel but also to pay the Company an additional amount for twenty years to compensate the Company for the building presently located on the premises.
202947_18_ITEM8_P28_S7	Under the nine land leases, the tenants are required to negotiate any tax stabilization treaty or other arrangements, appeal any changes in real property assessments, and pay real property taxes assessed on land and improvements under these arrangements.
202947_18_ITEM8_P28_S8	Accordingly, with the exception of Parcel 20, real property taxes payable by the tenants are excluded from leasing revenues and leasing expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of income and retained earnings.
202947_18_ITEM8_P28_S9	For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the real property taxes attributable to the Company s land under these nine leases were $1,230,000 and $1,212,000, respectively.
202947_18_ITEM8_P28_S10	Under two of the long-term land leases, the Company receives contingent rentals (based upon a fixed percentage of gross revenue received by the tenants) which totaled $101,000 and $105,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
202947_18_ITEM8_P28_S11	With respect to the Parcel 6B and 6C leases, each lessee has the right to terminate its lease at any time during the remaining term of that lease upon thirty days notice.
202947_18_ITEM8_P28_S12	To date, no notice of termination has been received by the Company.
202947_18_ITEM8_P29_S0	The current annual rents on Parcels 6B and 6C are $195,000 and $200,000, respectively.
202947_18_ITEM8_P30_S0	Lamar lease: The Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, leases 23 outdoor advertising locations containing 44 billboard faces along interstate and primary highways in Rhode Island and Massachusetts to Lamar under a lease which expires in 2045.
