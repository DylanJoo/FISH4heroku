1099800_11_ITEM1_P59_S1	Edwards Lifesciences has also licensed certain patent rights to others.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P60_S0	Edwards Lifesciences monitors the products of its competitors for possible infringement of Edwards Lifesciences' owned and/or licensed patents.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P60_S1	Litigation has been necessary to enforce certain patent rights held by Edwards Lifesciences, and the Company plans to continue to defend and prosecute its rights with respect to such patents.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P61_S0	Edwards Lifesciences owns certain United States registered trademarks used in its business.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P61_S1	Many Company trademarks have also been registered for use in certain foreign countries where registration is available and Edwards Lifesciences has determined it is commercially advantageous to do so.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P62_S0	The Company's products and technologies are subject to regulation by numerous domestic and foreign government agencies, including the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), and various laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of the Company's products and technologies.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P62_S1	The Company is also governed by federal, state, local and international laws of general applicability, such as those regulating employee health and safety and the protection of the environment.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P62_S2	Overall, the amount and scope of domestic and foreign laws and regulations applicable to the Company's business is increasing.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P63_S0	In the United States, the FDA has responsibility for regulating medical devices.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P63_S1	The FDA regulates design, development, testing, clinical studies, manufacturing, labeling, promotion and record-keeping for medical devices, and reporting of adverse events, recalls, or other field actions by manufacturers and users to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P63_S2	Many of the devices that Edwards Lifesciences develops and markets are in a category for which the FDA has implemented stringent clinical investigation and pre-market clearance or approval requirements.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P63_S3	The process of obtaining FDA clearance or approval to market a product is resource intensive, lengthy and costly.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P63_S4	FDA review may involve substantial delays that adversely affect the marketing and sale of Edwards Lifesciences' products.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P64_S0	the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter valve in the United States.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P65_S0	Ultimately, the FDA may not authorize the commercial release of a medical device if it determines the device is not safe and effective or does not meet other standards for clearance.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P65_S1	Additionally, even if a product is cleared or approved, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of these products once commercialized.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P66_S0	The FDA has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order the repair, replacement or refund of the costs of such devices, or preclude the importation of devices that are or appear violative.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P66_S1	The FDA also conducts inspections to determine compliance with the quality system regulations concerning the manufacturing and design of devices and current medical device reporting regulations, recall regulations, clinical testing regulations, and other requirements.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P66_S2	The FDA may withdraw product clearances or approvals due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P66_S3	Additionally, the failure to comply with FDA or comparable regulatory standards or the discovery of previously unknown product problems could result in fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances or approvals, seizures, injunctions, recalls, refunds, civil money penalties, or criminal prosecution.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P66_S4	The Company's compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P66_S5	Moreover, the FDA and several other United States agencies administer controls over the export of medical devices from the United States and the importation of devices into the United States, which could also subject the Company to sanctions for noncompliance.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P67_S0	Medical device laws are also in effect in most markets around the world including Europe, Japan and many other countries.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P67_S1	Similar to the United States laws, foreign regulations include import/export regulation, inspection requirements, comprehensive device approval requirements, requests for product data, certifications or record-keeping, and reporting of adverse events by manufacturers and users (to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices).
1099800_11_ITEM1_P67_S2	In addition, the process of obtaining foreign approval to market a product or complying with product data requests can be resource intensive, lengthy and costly, and such requirements may or may not be more rigorous than those required in the United States.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P67_S3	Foreign regulations can also subject the Company to penalties for noncompliance, criminal sanctions and the revocation of its license to conduct business in a foreign jurisdiction.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P68_S0	The Company is also subject to additional laws and regulations that govern its business operations, products and technologies, including:
1099800_11_ITEM1_P69_S0	federal, state and foreign anti-kickback laws and regulations, which generally prohibit payments to physicians or other purchasers of medical products as an inducement to purchase a product; the Stark law, which prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to a provider that bills these programs for the provision of certain designated health services if the physician (or a member of the physician's immediate family) has a financial relationship with that provider; federal and state laws and regulations that protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient records, and restrict the use and disclosure of such information, in particular, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996; the False Claims Act, which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claims for payment to a federally funded health care program, and health care fraud statutes that prohibit false statements and improper claims to any third-party payor; and the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which can be used to prosecute companies in the United States for arrangements with foreign government officials or other parties outside the United States.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P70_S0	To assist in the Company's compliance efforts, the Company adheres to many codes of ethics and conduct regarding its sales and marketing activities in the United States and other countries in which it operates.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P70_S1	In addition, the Company has in place and works to improve its internal business compliance programs and policies.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P71_S0	Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs, including price regulation and competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements, are continuing in many countries where Edwards Lifesciences does business, including the United States, Europe and Japan.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P71_S1	As a result of these changes, the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical therapies.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P71_S2	For example, government programs, private health care insurance and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for procedures or treatments, and some third-party payors require their pre-approval before new or innovative devices or therapies are utilized by patients.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P71_S3	These various initiatives have created increased price sensitivity over medical products generally and may impact demand for the Company's products and technologies.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P72_S0	The delivery of the Company's products is subject to regulation by the Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and comparable state and foreign agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P72_S1	Foreign governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P73_S0	Reimbursement schedules regulate the amount the United States government will reimburse hospitals and doctors for the inpatient care of persons covered by Medicare.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P74_S0	Several legislative proposals in the United States have been advanced that would restrict future funding increases for government-funded programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P74_S1	Changes in current reimbursement levels could have an adverse effect on market demand and the Company's pricing flexibility.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P75_S0	Health care cost containment efforts have also prompted domestic hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power, and this trend is expected to continue.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P75_S1	The medical device industry has also experienced some consolidation, partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P75_S2	As a result, transactions with customers are larger, more complex and tend to involve more long-term contracts than in the past.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P75_S3	The enhanced purchasing power of these larger customers increases the pressure on product pricing.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P76_S0	In 2010, significant reforms to the health care system were adopted as law in the United States.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P76_S1	The law includes provisions that, among other things, reduce or limit Medicare reimbursement, require all individuals to have health insurance (with limited exceptions) and impose increased taxes.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P76_S2	Specifically, the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize health care reform in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on United States sales of most medical devices beginning in 2013.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P76_S3	The excise tax will increase the Company's operating expenses.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P76_S4	The new law or any future legislation could reduce medical procedure volumes, lower reimbursement for the Company's products, and impact the demand for the Company's products or the prices at which the Company sells its products.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P77_S0	On October 25, 2010, the Puerto Rican government enacted a new tax law effective for transactions occurring after December 31, 2010.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P77_S1	The law, Act 154, modifies Puerto Rican tax law by imposing a temporary excise tax on intercompany purchases made through 2016 and by adopting a new sourcing rule.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P77_S2	The Company projects that the excise tax impact for 2011 of approximately $6.0 million will be offset by credits available under the implementing excise tax regulations.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P77_S3	The financial impact of the new sourcing rule is not expected to be material.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P78_S0	Edwards Lifesciences' quarterly net sales are influenced by many factors, including new product introductions, acquisitions, regulatory approvals, patient and physician holiday schedules, and other factors.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P79_S0	Net sales in the third quarter are typically lower than other quarters of the year due to the seasonality of the United States and European markets, where summer vacation schedules normally result in fewer procedures.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P80_S0	As of December 31, 2010, Edwards Lifesciences had approximately 7,000 employees worldwide, the majority of whom were located at the Company's headquarters in Irvine, California, and at its manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P80_S1	Other major concentrations of employees are located in Europe, Japan and Singapore.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P81_S0	Edwards Lifesciences emphasizes competitive compensation, benefits, equity participation and work environment practices in its efforts to attract and retain qualified personnel, and employs a rigorous talent management system.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P81_S1	None of Edwards Lifesciences' North American employees are represented by a labor union.
1099800_11_ITEM1_P81_S2	In various countries outside of North America, the Company interacts with trade unions and work councils that represent a limited number of employees.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	An investor should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P0_S2	If any of these events or circumstances occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially harmed.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P0_S3	In that case, the value of our securities could decline and an investor could lose part or all of his or her investment.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our products may become obsolete and our operating results may suffer.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The cardiovascular products industry is characterized by technological changes, frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Without the timely introduction of new and improved products, our products could become technologically obsolete and our revenue and operating results would suffer.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Even if we are able to develop new products, our ability to market them could be limited by the need for regulatory clearance, restrictions imposed on approved indications, entrenched patterns of clinical practice, uncertainty over third-party reimbursement or other factors.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Technical innovations often require substantial time and investment before we can determine their commercial viability.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We may not have the financial resources necessary to fund these projects.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P3_S2	In addition, even if we are able to successfully develop new or improved products, they may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development, and they may be rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products with newer technologies or features.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We may incur product liability losses that could adversely affect our operating results.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P5_S2	In addition, many of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product related risks or product related information could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, patients.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Such a problem could result in product liability lawsuits and claims, safety alerts or product recalls in the future, which, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Product liability claims may be brought from time to time either by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We may incur charges related to such matters in excess of any established reserves and such charges, including the establishment of any such reserves, could have a material adverse impact on our net income and net cash flows.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We may experience supply interruptions that could harm our ability to manufacture products.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We use a broad range of raw and organic materials and other items in the design and manufacture of our products.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Our Heart Valve Therapy products are manufactured from treated natural animal tissue and man-made materials.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Our non-implantable products are manufactured from man-made raw materials including resins, chemicals, electronics and metals.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P9_S3	We purchase certain of the materials and components used in the manufacture of our products from external suppliers, and we purchase certain supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance, cost-effectiveness, availability or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P9_S4	The general economic conditions could adversely affect the financial viability of our suppliers, resulting in their inability to provide materials and components used in the manufacture of our products.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P9_S5	While we work closely with suppliers to monitor their financial viability and to assure continuity of supply and maintain high quality and reliability, these efforts may not be successful.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P9_S6	In addition, due to the rigorous regulations and requirements of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products (including the need for approval of any change in supply arrangements), we may have difficulty establishing additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or at all if the need arises.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P9_S7	Although alternative supplier options are considered and identified, we typically do not pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships and the time and expense associated with the regulatory validation process.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P9_S8	A change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to product performance or incorporate unique technology, and the loss of any existing supply contract could have a material adverse effect on us.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	In an effort to reduce potential product liability exposure, certain suppliers have announced in the past that they might limit or terminate sales of certain materials and parts to companies that manufacture implantable medical devices.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If we are unable to obtain these raw materials, our business could be harmed.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Regulatory agencies in the United States or other international geographies from time to time have limited or banned the use of certain materials used in the manufacture of our products.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In these circumstances, transition periods typically provide time to arrange for alternative materials.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	If we are unable to identify alternative materials and secure approval for their use in a timely manner, our business could be harmed.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Some of our suppliers are located outside the United States.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	As a result, trade or regulatory embargoes imposed by foreign countries or the United States could result in delays or shortages that could harm our business.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The manufacturing of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P14_S1	If we or one of our suppliers encounters manufacturing or quality problems, our business could suffer.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls, due in part to rigorous regulatory requirements.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In addition, quality is extremely important due to the serious and costly consequences of a product failure.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Problems can arise during the manufacturing process for a number of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow protocols and procedures, raw material problems or human error.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P15_S3	If these problems arise or if we otherwise fail to meet our internal quality standards or those of the FDA or other applicable regulatory body, our reputation could be damaged, we could become subject to a safety alert or a recall, we could incur product liability and other costs, product approvals could be delayed and our business could otherwise be adversely affected.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We may be required to recognize charges in connection with the write-down of our investments, the disposition of some of our businesses, the termination of interest rate swap agreements or for other reasons.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We have equity investments in other companies, and we may make similar investments in the future.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P17_S1	To the extent that the value of any of these investments declines, we may be required to recognize charges to write down the value of that investment.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	At December 31, 2010, we had $25.0 million of investments in equity instruments of other companies and had recorded unrealized gains of $2.2 million on these investments on our consolidated balance sheet in " Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss ," net of tax.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	In addition, from time to time we identify businesses and products that are not performing at a level commensurate with the rest of our business.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We may seek to dispose of these underperforming businesses or products.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We may also seek to dispose of other businesses or products for strategic or other business reasons.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P19_S3	If we cannot dispose of a business or product on acceptable terms, we may voluntarily cease operations related to that business or product.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Any of these events could result in charges, which could be substantial and which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Historically, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements and may do so from time to time in the future.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P20_S1	In the event that we elect to terminate a swap agreement prior to its maturity, we could be required to make cash payments to the counterparty and to recognize a charge in connection with that termination, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We may not successfully identify and complete acquisitions or strategic alliances on favorable terms or achieve anticipated synergies relating to any acquisitions or alliances, and such acquisitions could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, require significant management resources and require significant charges or write-downs.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We regularly explore potential acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, as well as potential strategic alliances.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P22_S1	We may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates or appropriate partners with which to form alliances.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Even if we identify appropriate acquisition or alliance candidates, we may be unable to complete the acquisitions or alliances on favorable terms, if at all.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P22_S3	In addition, the process of integrating an acquired business, technology, service or product into our existing operations could result in unforeseen difficulties and expenditures.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Integration of an acquired company often requires significant expenditures as well as significant management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our other businesses.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Moreover, we may not realize the anticipated financial or other benefits of an acquisition or alliance.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We may be required to take charges or write-downs in connection with acquisitions.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	In particular, acquisitions of businesses engaged in the development of new products may give rise to in-process research and development assets.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P23_S2	To the extent that the value of these assets declines, we may be required to write down the value of the assets.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Also, in connection with certain asset acquisitions, we may be required to take an immediate charge related to acquired in-process research and development.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Either of these situations could result in substantial charges, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Future acquisitions could also require the issuance of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization of expenses related to other intangible assets, any of which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P24_S1	In addition, equity or debt financing required for such acquisitions may not be available.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	General economic and political conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	External factors can affect our profitability and financial condition.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Such external factors include general domestic and global economic conditions, such as interest rates and tax rates, and the political environment regarding healthcare in general.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P26_S2	For example, an increase in interest rates could result in an increase in our borrowing costs and could otherwise restrict our ability to access the capital markets.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Negative conditions in the credit and capital markets could also impair our ability to access the financial markets for working capital or other funds, and could negatively impact our ability to borrow.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Such conditions could result in decreased liquidity, and could result in impairments in the carrying value of our investments and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	In 2010, significant reforms to the healthcare system were adopted as law in the United States.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Specifically, the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize healthcare reform in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on United States sales of most medical devices beginning in 2013.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The excise tax will increase the Company's operating expenses.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P28_S2	The new law or any future legislation could reduce medical procedure volumes, lower reimbursement for the Company's products, and impact the demand for the Company's products or the prices at which the Company sells its products.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our business is subject to economic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations, including risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Because we sell our products in a number of countries, our business is subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including risks associated with United States government oversight and enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as well as with the United Kingdom's Bribery Act and similar laws in other jurisdictions.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Our net sales originating outside of the United States, as a percentage of total net sales, were 61% in 2010.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P30_S2	We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P30_S3	In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the United States.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	changes in local medical reimbursement policies and programs; unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements; changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions, particularly in emerging regions; trade protection measures, quotas, embargoes, import or export licensing requirements and duties, tariffs or surcharges; potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; difficulty in staffing and managing global operations; cultural, exchange rate or other local factors affecting financial terms with customers; an outbreak of any life threatening communicable disease; economic and political instability and local economic and political conditions; differing labor regulations; and differing protection of intellectual property.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Substantially all of our sales outside of the United States are denominated in local currencies.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Measured in local currency, a substantial portion of our international sales was generated in Europe (and primarily denominated in the Euro) and in Japan.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P32_S2	The United States dollar value of our international sales varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Decreases in the value of the United States dollar to the Euro or the Japanese yen have the effect of increasing our reported revenues even when the volume of international sales has remained constant.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P32_S4	Increases in the value of the United States dollar relative to the Euro or the Japanese yen, as well as other currencies, have the opposite effect and, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our reported revenues and results of operations.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P32_S5	We have a hedging program for certain currencies that attempts to manage currency exchange rate risks to an acceptable level based on management's judgment of the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity and cost; however, this hedging program does not completely eliminate the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The stock market can be volatile and fluctuations in our quarterly operating results as well as other factors could cause our stock price to decline.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	From time to time the stock market experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P34_S1	This volatility can have a significant effect on the market prices of securities for reasons unrelated to underlying performance.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P34_S2	These broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect our stock price, regardless of our operating results.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	response to any of the other risk factors set out above and below, as well as a number of other factors, including the performance of comparable companies or the medical device industry.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P36_S1	A high proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to significant sales, research and development, and manufacturing costs.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Thus, small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter, and the price of our common stock could fall.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Other factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include:
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	announcements of innovations, new products, strategic developments or business combinations by us or our competitors; changes in financial estimates and recommendations of securities analysts; demand for and clinical acceptance of products; the timing and execution of customer contracts, particularly large contracts that would materially affect our operating results in a given quarter; the timing of sales of products and of the introduction of new products; the timing of regulatory approvals; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; delays or problems in introducing new products; changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors; changes in governmental reimbursement rates for our products; increased expenses, whether related to sales and marketing, raw materials or supplies, product development or administration; changes in the level of economic activity in the United States or other regions in which we do business; costs related to acquisitions of technologies or businesses; and our ability to expand our operations and the amount and timing of expansion-related expenditures.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We face intense competition, and if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The cardiovascular medical device industry is highly competitive.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P39_S1	We compete with many companies, some of which have longer operating histories, better brand or name recognition, broader product lines and greater access to financial and other resources.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Our customers consider many factors when selecting a product, including product reliability, clinical outcomes, product availability, price and services provided by the manufacturer.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P39_S3	In addition, our ability to compete will depend in large part on our ability to develop and acquire new products and technologies, anticipate technology advances and keep pace with other developers of cardiovascular therapies and technologies.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P39_S4	Our competitive position can also be adversely affected by product problems, physician advisories and safety alerts, reflecting the importance of quality in the medical device industry.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P39_S5	Market share can shift as a result of any of these factors.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P39_S6	See " Competition " under " Business " included herein.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Consolidation in the healthcare industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The healthcare industry has been consolidating and, as a result, transactions with customers are larger, more complex, and tend to involve more long-term contracts.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P41_S1	The purchasing power of these larger customers has increased, and may continue to increase, causing downward pressure on product pricing.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P41_S2	As an example, many existing and potential domestic customers for our products have combined to form GPOs.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	GPOs negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors and these negotiated prices are made available to members of GPOs.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	If we are not one of the providers selected by a GPO, we may be precluded from making sales to members of a GPO.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	purchases of a broader range of medical equipment and supplies.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Further, we may be required to commit to pricing that has a material adverse effect on our revenues and profit margins, business, financial condition and results of operations.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Our success and competitive position are dependent in part upon our proprietary intellectual property.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P46_S1	We rely on a combination of patents and trade secrets to protect our proprietary intellectual property, and we will continue to do so.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Although we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of means, we cannot guarantee that the protective steps we have taken are adequate to protect these rights.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged and held invalid.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P47_S1	In addition, as our patents expire, we may be unsuccessful in extending their protection through new patents or patent term extensions.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P47_S2	The failure to maintain or extend our patents could have a material adverse effect on us.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We also rely on confidentiality agreements with certain employees, consultants and other third parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary information.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P48_S1	These agreements could be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for such a breach.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P48_S2	In addition, others could independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary information.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We spend significant resources to enforce our intellectual property rights, sometimes resulting in litigation.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Intellectual property litigation is complex and can be expensive and time-consuming.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P49_S2	However, our efforts in this regard may not be successful.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P49_S3	We may not be able to detect infringement.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P49_S4	In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Patent litigation can result in substantial cost and diversion of effort.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Intellectual property protection may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, enabling our competitors to capture increased market position.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P50_S2	The invalidation of key intellectual property rights or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits filed to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or prospects.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P52_S0	During recent years, we and our competitors have been involved in substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P52_S1	From time to time, we may be forced to defend against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, and such intellectual property litigation could be costly and time-consuming.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Adverse determinations in any such litigation could result in significant liabilities to third parties, or could require us to seek licenses from third parties and could, if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms, prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using certain products, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on us.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P52_S3	In addition, some licenses may be non-exclusive, which could provide our competitors access to the same technologies.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Third parties could also obtain patents that may require us to either redesign products or, if possible, negotiate licenses from such third parties.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Such licenses may materially increase our expenses.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P53_S2	If we are unable to redesign products or obtain a license, we might have to exit a particular product offering.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We and our customers are subject to rigorous governmental regulations and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products that are compatible with these regulations.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P54_S1	In addition, failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial sanctions which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P55_S0	The medical devices we manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities, including regulations that cover the composition, labeling, testing, clinical study, design, manufacturing, packaging, marketing, advertising, promotion and distribution of our products.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We are required to register with the FDA as a device manufacturer.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P56_S1	As a result, we are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA's Quality System Regulation ("QSR") requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, design, quality control and documentation procedures.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P56_S2	The FDA may also inspect our compliance with requirements related to adverse event reporting, recalls or corrections (field actions), the conduct of clinical studies, and other requirements.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P57_S0	In the European Union, we are required to maintain certain CE Mark and ISO certifications in order to sell our products, and are subject to periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P57_S1	If we or our suppliers fail to adhere to QSR, ISO or similar requirements, this could delay product production and/or lead to fines, difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances, recalls or other consequences, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or prospects.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Medical devices must receive FDA clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the United States.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P58_S1	In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of approved products that have been commercialized, and can prevent or limit further marketing of a product based upon the results of post-marketing programs.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P58_S2	In addition, the federal Medical Device Reporting regulations require us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P58_S3	Federal regulations also require us to report certain recalls or corrective actions to the FDA.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P58_S4	Furthermore, most major markets for medical devices outside the United States require clearance, approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P58_S5	The process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device, particularly from the FDA and certain foreign governmental authorities, can be costly and time-consuming, and clearances or approvals may not be granted for future products or product improvements on a timely basis, if at all.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P58_S6	Delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, clearances or approvals for future products or product improvements could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations or prospects.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P59_S0	At any time after approval of a product, the FDA may conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with both QSR requirements, and/or current Medical Device Reporting regulations, or other regulatory requirements.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Noncompliance with applicable requirements may subject the Company or responsible individuals to sanctions including civil money penalties, product seizure, injunction, or criminal prosecution.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Additionally, product approvals by the FDA can be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We are also subject to various United States and international laws pertaining to healthcare pricing and fraud and abuse, including prohibitions on kickbacks and the submission of false claims laws and restrictions on relationships with physicians and other referral sources.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P60_S1	These laws are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation, which could require us to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if they are found not to be in compliance.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P61_S0	In recent years, both the United States and foreign government regulators have increased regulation, enforcement, inspections and governmental investigations of the medical device industry, including increased United States government oversight, including misbranding investigations, and enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P61_S1	In addition, the recently enacted United Kingdom Bribery Act as well as similar laws in other jurisdictions could give rise to increased enforcement of prohibitions against bribery and other illegal payments or for the failure to have procedures in place that prevent such payments.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Despite implementation of robust compliance processes, we may be subject, from time to time, to increased regulation, as well as inspections, investigations and other enforcement actions by governmental authorities.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P62_S0	or operating restrictions, enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against us or our officers or employees, and can recommend criminal prosecution to the Department of Justice.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Moreover, governmental authorities can ban or request the recall, repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any device or product we manufacture or distribute.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P62_S2	Any of the foregoing actions could result in decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P62_S3	In addition to the sanctions for noncompliance described above, commencement of an enforcement proceeding, inspection or investigation could divert substantial management attention from the operation of our business and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Our industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities, which may lead to greater governmental regulation in the future.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Our medical devices and our business activities are subject to rigorous regulation, including by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P64_S1	These authorities and members of Congress have been increasing their scrutiny of our industry.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P64_S2	In addition, certain states have recently passed or are considering legislation restricting our interactions with health care providers and requiring disclosure of certain payments to them.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P64_S3	Also, while recent case law has clarified that the FDA's authority over certain medical devices preempts state tort laws, legislation has been introduced at the federal level to allow state intervention.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P64_S4	We anticipate that the government will continue to scrutinize our industry closely, and that additional regulation by governmental authorities may increase compliance costs, exposure to litigation and other adverse effects to our operations.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Unsuccessful clinical trials or developmental procedures relating to products under development could have a material adverse effect on our prospects.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P66_S0	The development of new products requires extensive clinical trials and procedures.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Such clinical trials are inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that these trials or procedures will be completed in a timely or cost-effective manner or result in a commercially viable product.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P66_S2	Failure to successfully complete these trials or procedures in a timely and cost-effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our prospects.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Clinical trials may experience significant setbacks even after earlier trials have shown promising results.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Further, preliminary results from clinical trials may be contradicted by subsequent clinical analysis.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P67_S2	In addition, results from our clinical trials or procedures may not be supported by actual long-term studies or clinical experience.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P67_S3	If preliminary clinical results are later contradicted, or if initial results cannot be supported by actual long-term studies or clinical experience, our business could be adversely affected.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P67_S4	Clinical trials may be suspended or terminated by us, the FDA or other regulatory authorities at any time if it is believed that the trial participants face unacceptable health risks.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Certain of our products, including pericardial tissue valves, are manufactured using bovine tissue.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Concerns relating to the potential transmission of BSE, commonly known as "mad cow disease," from cows to humans may result in reduced acceptance of products containing bovine materials.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Certain medical device regulatory agencies have considered whether to continue to permit the sale of medical devices that incorporate bovine material.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P70_S0	We obtain bovine tissue only from closely controlled sources within the United States and Australia.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P70_S1	The bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valves is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility for the suspected BSE infectious agent.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P70_S2	We have not experienced any significant adverse impact on our sales as a result of concerns regarding BSE, but no assurance can be given that such an impact may not occur in the future.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P71_S0	If third-party payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or impose other cost containment measures to reduce reimbursement levels, our ability to profitably sell our products will be harmed.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P72_S0	We sell our products and technologies to hospitals, doctors and other health care providers, all of which receive reimbursement for the health care services provided to patients from third-party payors, such as government programs (both domestic and international), private insurance plans and managed care programs.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P72_S1	The ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products from private and governmental third-party payors is critical to the success of medical technology companies.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P72_S2	The availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P72_S3	Reimbursement varies from country to country and can significantly impact acceptance of new products.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P73_S1	There can be no assurance that levels of reimbursement, if any, will not be decreased in the future, or that future legislation, regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payors will not otherwise adversely affect the demand for and price levels of our products.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P74_S0	The introduction of cost containment incentives, combined with closer scrutiny of health care expenditures by both private health insurers and employers, has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Hospitals or physicians may respond to such cost-containment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other therapies.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P74_S2	In addition, recently enacted legislation in the United States to reform health care policies could adversely affect reimbursement levels for our products, or otherwise adversely affect our product pricing and profitability.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs, including price regulation, are underway in several countries around the world.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P75_S1	In many countries, customers are reimbursed for our products under a government operated insurance system.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P75_S2	Under such a system, the government periodically reviews reimbursement levels and may limit patient access.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P75_S3	If a government were to decide to reduce reimbursement levels, our product pricing could be adversely affected.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods as determined by such third-party payors, or was used for an unapproved indication.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P76_S1	Third-party payors may also deny reimbursement for experimental procedures and devices.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P77_S0	We believe that many of our existing products are cost-effective, even though the one-time cost may be significant, because they are intended to reduce overall health care costs over a long period of time.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P77_S1	We cannot be certain that these third-party payors will recognize these cost savings instead of merely focusing on the lower initial costs associated with competing therapies.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P77_S2	If our products are not considered cost-effective by third-party payors, our customers may not be reimbursed for them, resulting in lower sales of our products.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Our operations are subject to environmental, health and safety regulations that could result in substantial costs.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Our operations are subject to environmental, health and safety laws, and regulations concerning, among other things, the generation, handling, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes, the cleanup of hazardous substance releases, and emissions or discharges into the air or water.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P79_S1	We have incurred and may incur expenditures in the future in connection with environmental, health and safety laws, and regulations.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P79_S2	New laws and regulations, violations of these laws or regulations, stricter enforcement of existing requirements, or the discovery of previously unknown contamination could require us to incur costs or could become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could be material.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P80_S0	The success of many of our products depends upon strong relationships with certain key physicians.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P81_S0	The development, marketing and sale of many of our products requires us to maintain working relationships with physicians upon whom we rely to provide considerable knowledge and experience.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P81_S1	These physicians may assist us as researchers, marketing consultants, product trainers and consultants, inventors and as public speakers.
1099800_11_ITEM1A_P82_S0	marketing of our products could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1099800_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	The locations and uses of the major properties of Edwards Lifesciences are as follows:
1099800_11_ITEM2_P1_S0	The Irvine, California lease expires in 2021; the Draper, Utah lease expires in 2025; the Dominican Republic property has one lease that expires in 2012 and one that expires in 2016; the Puerto Rico property has one lease that expires in 2018 and one that expires in 2016; the Horw, Switzerland lease is renewed annually with appropriate termination notice provisions; the Tokyo, Japan lease expires in 2012; and the Changi, Singapore landlease expires in 2036.
1099800_11_ITEM2_P2_S0	The Company's properties have been well maintained, are in good operating condition and are adequate for current needs.
1099800_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	In February 2008, Edwards Lifesciences filed a lawsuit against CoreValve, Inc. ("CoreValve") in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that its ReValving System infringes three of the Company's U.S. Andersen patents, later narrowed to one patent ("the '552 patent").
1099800_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	CoreValve was acquired by Medtronic, Inc. ("Medtronic") in April 2009.
1099800_11_ITEM3_P1_S0	In April 2010, a federal jury found that patent to be valid and found that CoreValve willfully infringes it.
1099800_11_ITEM3_P1_S1	The jury also awarded Edwards $73.9 million in damages.
1099800_11_ITEM3_P1_S2	In February 2011, the District Court reaffirmed the jury decision and ruled that Edwards is entitled to recover additional damages due to CoreValve's continued infringing sales from the trial through the life of the patent, plus interest.
1099800_11_ITEM3_P1_S3	In the same ruling, the court denied Edwards' motions for a permanent injunction and increased damages relating to CoreValve's willful infringement.
1099800_11_ITEM3_P1_S4	CoreValve has appealed and Edwards plans to file a cross-appeal.
1099800_11_ITEM3_P1_S5	A second lawsuit is pending in the same court against CoreValve and Medtronic alleging infringement of three U.S. Andersen patents.
1099800_11_ITEM3_P1_S6	In September 2010, the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted Medtronic's third request to reexamine the validity of the claim of the '552 patent and later issued an initial Office Action rejecting the claim of the '552 patent.
1099800_11_ITEM3_P2_S0	Earlier, in May 2007, the Company filed a lawsuit against CoreValve alleging infringement of the Company's European Andersen patent.
1099800_11_ITEM3_P3_S0	Germany, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief.
1099800_11_ITEM3_P3_S1	In October 2008, the Court rejected this assertion and dismissed the infringement lawsuit.
1099800_11_ITEM3_P3_S2	In February 2010, a German Appeals Court affirmed.
1099800_11_ITEM3_P4_S0	In May 2007 and June 2007, CoreValve filed separate lawsuits in London, United Kingdom, and Munich, Germany, respectively, alleging the patent to be invalid.
1099800_11_ITEM3_P4_S1	The Company then asserted that CoreValve's ReValving System infringes the Andersen patent in the United Kingdom.
1099800_11_ITEM3_P4_S2	In January 2009, the United Kingdom Court determined that the Andersen patent is valid but not infringed by CoreValve.
1099800_11_ITEM3_P4_S3	In May 2010, a United Kingdom Appeals Court affirmed the lower court.
1099800_11_ITEM3_P4_S4	In January 2010, the German Courts also determined that the Andersen patent is valid.
1099800_11_ITEM3_P4_S5	In December 2010, these lawsuits were resolved pursuant to a confidential settlement between the parties.
1099800_11_ITEM3_P5_S0	In February 2008, Cook, Inc. ("Cook") filed a lawsuit in the District Patent Court in Dusseldorf, Germany, against Edwards Lifesciences alleging that the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve infringes on a Cook patent.
1099800_11_ITEM3_P5_S1	Edwards Lifesciences subsequently filed lawsuits in London, United Kingdom, and in Munich, Germany, against Cook alleging that the patents were invalid.
1099800_11_ITEM3_P5_S2	In the United Kingdom lawsuit, Cook counterclaimed, alleging infringement by Edwards.
1099800_11_ITEM3_P5_S3	In March 2009, the German Courts ruled that the Company does not infringe the Cook patent.
1099800_11_ITEM3_P5_S4	In June 2009, the United Kingdom Court also ruled that the Company does not infringe the Cook patent and, further, that the Cook patent is invalid.
1099800_11_ITEM3_P5_S5	In June 2010, a United Kingdom Appeals Court affirmed.
1099800_11_ITEM3_P5_S6	In April 2010, the German Courts also determined that the Cook patent is invalid.
1099800_11_ITEM3_P6_S0	In March and September 2010, the Company received grand jury subpoenas for documents from the United States Attorney's Office in the Central District of California in connection with an investigation by the FDA.
1099800_11_ITEM3_P6_S1	The subpoenas to the Company seek records relating to the Vigilance I Monitor model with software release 5.3 that was the subject of a voluntary field recall by the Company in June 2006.

1099800_11_ITEM3_P7_S1	Such cases and claims raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the facts and circumstances of each particular case or claim, the jurisdiction in which each suit is brought, and differences in applicable law.
1099800_11_ITEM3_P7_S2	Upon resolution of any such legal matter or other claim, Edwards Lifesciences may incur charges in excess of established reserves.
1099800_11_ITEM3_P7_S3	While any such charge could have a material adverse impact on Edwards Lifesciences' net income or cash flows in the period in which it is recorded or paid, management does not believe that any such charge relating to any currently pending lawsuit would have a material adverse effect on Edwards Lifesciences' financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
1099800_11_ITEM3_P8_S0	Edwards Lifesciences is subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside of the United States.
1099800_11_ITEM3_P9_S0	The operations of Edwards Lifesciences, like those of other medical device companies, involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes.
1099800_11_ITEM3_P9_S1	While it is difficult to quantify the potential impact of continuing compliance with environmental protection laws, management believes that such compliance will not have a material impact on Edwards Lifesciences' financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

1099800_11_ITEM7_P7_S2	The Company continued to manufacture these products for the buyer until September 2009 when manufacturing was transferred to the buyer.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	The healthcare marketplace continues to be competitive with strong global and local competitors.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	The Company competes with many companies, ranging from small start-up enterprises to companies that are larger and more established than Edwards Lifesciences with access to significant financial resources.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P8_S2	Furthermore, rapid product development and technological change characterize the market in which the Company competes.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	Global demand for healthcare is increasing as the population ages.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	There is mounting pressure to contain healthcare costs in the face of this increasing demand, which has resulted in pricing and market share pressures.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P9_S2	The cardiovascular segment of the medical device industry is dynamic, and technology, cost-of-care considerations, regulatory reform, industry and customer consolidation, and evolving patient needs are expected to continue to drive change.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	In March 2010, significant reforms to the healthcare system were adopted as law in the United States.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	The law includes provisions that, among other things, reduce or limit Medicare reimbursement, require all individuals to have health insurance (with limited exceptions) and impose increased taxes.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P10_S2	Specifically, the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize healthcare reform in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on United States sales of most medical devices beginning in 2013.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P10_S3	The excise tax will increase the Company's operating expenses.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P10_S4	The new law or any future legislation could reduce medical procedure volumes, lower reimbursement for the Company's products, and impact the demand for the Company's products or the prices at which the Company sells its products.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	On April 12, 2010, the Company's Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split of its outstanding shares of common stock effected in the form of a stock dividend, paid on May 27, 2010 to shareholders of record on May 14, 2010.

1099800_11_ITEM7_P11_S2	All applicable share and per-share amounts in this " Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" have been retroactively adjusted to give effect to this stock split.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	The $11.5 million increase in net sales in the United States in 2010 was due primarily to:
1099800_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	the discontinuance of manufacturing in September 2009 of the divested LifeStent product line, which decreased net sales by $8.2 million.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	The $114.1 million increase in international net sales in 2010 was due primarily to:
1099800_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	hemofiltration products, which decreased net sales by $32.0 million.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	The Company sold its hemofiltration product line in September 2009.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	The $12.5 million increase in net sales in the United States in 2009 was due primarily to:
1099800_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	the divestiture of the LifeStent product line in mid-January 2008, which decreased net sales by $23.2 million.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	LifeStent sales after the divestiture resulted from the on-going manufacturing requirements of the sale agreement, which continued until the transfer of manufacturing to the buyer in September 2009.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	The $71.2 million increase in international net sales in 2009 was due primarily to:
1099800_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $15.2 million, due primarily to the weakening of the Euro against the United States dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar; and hemofiltration products, which decreased net sales by $10.6 million.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	The Company sold its hemofiltration product line in September 2009.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net sales is not necessarily indicative of the impact on net income due to the corresponding effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on international manufacturing and operating costs and the Company's hedging activities.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	The $123.4 million increase in net sales of Heart Valve Therapy products in 2010 was due primarily to:
1099800_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	the Edwards SAPIEN XT transcatheter heart valve, which increased net sales by $99.0 million; and pericardial tissue valves, which increased net sales by $26.2 million, primarily as a result of the Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna Aortic Ease valve.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	The $107.5 million increase in net sales of Heart Valve Therapy products in 2009 was due primarily to:
1099800_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $8.6 million, due primarily to the weakening of the Euro against the United States dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	The Company expects that its SAPIEN and SAPIEN XT transcatheter heart valves will continue to be strong contributors to 2011 sales.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	continue to drive surgical heart valve growth in 2011.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	The Company launched its Magna Mitral Ease valve in the United States and Europe during the third quarter of 2010, and expects to obtain approval in Japan during the fourth quarter of 2011.

1099800_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	During the second quarter of 2011, the Company expects to launch the Carpentier-Edwards Physio Tricuspid annuloplasty ring in the United States and Europe.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	This new ring expands the Company's market-leading repair portfolio and is designed to provide a more physiologic repair for a patient's tricuspid valve.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	The $1.6 million increase in net sales of Critical Care products in 2010 was due primarily to:
1099800_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	hemofiltration products, which decreased net sales by $32.3 million.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	The Company sold its hemofiltration product line in September 2009.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	The $0.7 million increase in net sales of Critical Care products in 2009 was due primarily to:
1099800_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	hemofiltration products, which decreased net sales by $13.6 million.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	The Company sold its hemofiltration product line in September 2009; and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $4.1 million, due primarily to the weakening of the Euro against the United States dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company launched, outside of the United States, a substantial upgrade designed to strengthen the FloTrac system's applicability in the medical intensive care unit and a new hardware platform with a simpler, more intuitive informational display.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	The Company expects to obtain approval for these products in the United States in the third quarter of 2011.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	In September 2010, the Company entered into a collaboration, license, and supply agreement related to its Central Venous Access product line ("Access Products").
1099800_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	Under the terms of the agreement, the Company granted the buyer an exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free license to manufacture, distribute, market and sell the Access Products in the United States.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P34_S2	The Company agreed to manufacture and exclusively supply the Access Products to the buyer through March 2013.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	The Company has a collaboration agreement with DexCom, Inc. ("DexCom") to develop products for continuously monitoring blood glucose levels in patients hospitalized for a variety of conditions.

1099800_11_ITEM7_P35_S2	The Company anticipates obtaining CE Mark on the second generation product by the end of 2011 and plans to begin commercial sales in 2012.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	The $7.4 million increase in net sales of Cardiac Surgery Systems products in 2010 was due primarily to MIS products, which increased net sales by $3.7 million, and specialty cannula products, which increased net sales by $3.1 million.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	The $3.6 million increase in net sales of Cardiac Surgery Systems products in 2009 was due primarily to MIS products, which increased net sales by $2.8 million.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	The $6.8 million and $28.1 million decreases in net sales of Vascular products in 2010 and 2009, respectively, were due primarily to the discontinuance of manufacturing in September 2009 of the divested LifeStent product line.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	The 2.0 percentage point increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2010 was driven by:
1099800_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	a 1.5 percentage point increase due to a more profitable international product mix, primarily higher sales of transcatheter heart valves and the divestiture of the hemofiltration product line, and the favorable impact of manufacturing performance; and a 0.5 percentage point increase primarily due to the favorable impact of manufacturing performance in the United States.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	The 3.7 percentage point increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2009 was driven by:
1099800_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	a 1.5 percentage point increase due primarily to a more profitable product mix in the United States, primarily from reduced sales of LifeStent products under the manufacturing requirements of the LifeStent sale agreement and higher sales of Heart Valve Therapy products; a 1.4 percentage point increase due to a more profitable international product mix, primarily higher sales of Heart Valve Therapy products and FloTrac systems; and the impact from the outcome of foreign currency hedging contracts.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	The $41.2 million increase in SG A expenses in 2010 was primarily in Europe due to the following: (1) higher sales and marketing expenses, primarily to support the transcatheter heart valve program and (2) higher sales-related spending in the Critical Care and Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product lines.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	Foreign currency had an unfavorable impact of $2.7 million, primarily due to the strengthening of various currencies against the United States dollar, primarily the Japanese yen, partially offset by the weakening of the Euro against the United States dollar.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	The $28.2 million increase in SG A expenses in 2009 was primarily in Europe due to the following: (1) investments for the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve program in Europe and (2) higher sales-related spending in the Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product line.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P45_S1	The increase was partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency (primarily the weakening of the Euro against the United States dollar) in the amount of $5.4 million.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	The increase in research and development expenses in 2010 was due to additional investments in all major product lines, primarily the transcatheter heart valve program.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	The increase in research and development expenses in 2009 was due primarily to additional investments in the transcatheter heart valve and glucose programs.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	The following are the developments related to the Company's transcatheter heart valve program:
1099800_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	the Company received conditional IDE approval from the FDA in March 2007 to initiate its PARTNER trial, a pivotal clinical trial of the Company's Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve technology.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	The PARTNER trial, which has two study arms, is evaluating the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve in patients who are considered at high risk for conventional open-heart valve surgery.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	In the first study arm ("Cohort A"), patients were randomized on a 1:1 basis to either high risk surgery or the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P50_S1	In the second study arm ("Cohort B"), patients who were deemed non-operable were randomized 1:1 to medical management or the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P50_S2	In addition, the Company received FDA approval for non-randomized continued access for all of its existing PARTNER sites.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P50_S3	During the third quarter of 2010, positive one-year data from Cohort B was published and the Company completed the submission of its pre-market approval to the FDA during the fourth quarter of 2010.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P50_S4	The Company anticipates launching its SAPIEN transcatheter valve in the United States during the fourth quarter of 2011.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	The Company believes that this next generation valve's features will help reduce its delivery profile without compromising strength, enabling it to better address the requirements of transfemoral delivery.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	in the United States, the Company submitted an IDE for SAPIEN XT in October 2009.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P52_S1	The PARTNER II trial will evaluate SAPIEN XT with both the NovaFlex and Ascendra2 delivery systems and will target high risk patients similar to those studied in the PARTNER trial.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	The first cohort of the PARTNER II trial ("PARTNER II Cohort B") will study up to 500 inoperable patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis using a 1:1 randomization of SAPIEN XT with the NovaFlex transfemoral delivery system versus SAPIEN with the RetroFlex 3 delivery system.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	In February 2011, the Company received conditional IDE approval from the FDA for PARTNER II Cohort B.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P53_S2	The Company expects to complete enrollment in this cohort by the end of 2011.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P53_S3	The second planned patient cohort ("PARTNER II Cohort A") will compare traditional open-heart surgery with SAPIEN XT delivered either transfemorally or transapically in high-risk surgical patients.

1099800_11_ITEM7_P76_S1	The $0.3 million decrease in interest expense for 2010 resulted primarily from prior year interest expense related to a sales and use tax audit settlement, partially offset by a higher average debt balance as compared to the prior year.

1099800_11_ITEM7_P84_S2	The net amounts of $50.4 million and $44.0 million, respectively, if recognized, would favorably affect the Company's effective tax rate.

1099800_11_ITEM7_P87_S2	The federal research credit favorably impacted the effective tax rate by 1.6 percentage points.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P88_S0	The Company strives to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P88_S1	While the Company has accrued for amounts it believes are the probable outcomes, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P88_S2	Furthermore, the Company may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise its right to appeal.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P88_S3	The uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation, regulations or case law.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P88_S4	Management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from these uncertain tax positions.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P89_S0	As a result of on-going negotiations of Advanced Pricing Agreements between Switzerland and the United States and between Japan and the United States, the expiration of statutes of limitations, and the possible settlement of on-going audits in several jurisdictions for multiple years throughout the world, the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months.

1099800_11_ITEM7_P90_S0	In February 2009, California enacted tax legislation which will be effective beginning 2011.

1099800_11_ITEM7_P92_S1	The tax benefits that result from reductions in the value of these investments are contingent on the Company realizing sufficient capital gains in the appropriate period with which to offset these expected capital losses.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P92_S2	Due to the uncertainty of the ready marketability of certain of these impaired investments, the Company has recorded valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets as they have accumulated.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P92_S3	As of December 31, 2010, deferred tax assets and corresponding valuation allowances of approximately $3.1 million had accumulated related to investments.

1099800_11_ITEM7_P94_S2	The Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Singapore and Switzerland grants provide the Company's manufacturing operations partial or full exemption from local taxes until the years 2013, 2017, 2019 and indefinitely, respectively.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P95_S0	The Company's sources of cash liquidity include cash on hand and cash equivalents, amounts available under credit facilities and cash from operations.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P95_S1	The Company believes that these sources are sufficient to fund the current requirements of working capital, capital expenditures and other financial commitments.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P95_S2	The Company further believes that it has the financial flexibility to attract long-term capital to fund short-term and long-term growth objectives.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P95_S3	However, no assurances can be given that such long-term capital will be available to Edwards Lifesciences on favorable terms, or at all.

1099800_11_ITEM7_P97_S3	The Company pays a facility fee regardless of available or outstanding borrowings, currently at an annual rate of 0.075%.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P97_S4	All amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement have been classified as short-term obligations as these obligations are due within one year.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P97_S5	The Company anticipates that it will extend or replace the Credit Agreement upon maturity.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P97_S6	However, no assurances can be given that the Credit Agreement will be extended or replaced on comparable terms as those currently in place.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P98_S0	As of December 31, 2010, borrowings of $41.8 million were outstanding under the Credit Agreement.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P99_S0	The Credit Agreement contains various financial and other covenants, all of which the Company was in compliance with at December 31, 2010.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P100_S0	The Company previously securitized, on a continuous basis, an undivided interest in certain eligible pools of trade accounts receivable in the United States and Japan.

1099800_11_ITEM7_P100_S2	In February 2009, the Company terminated its securitization program in Japan and paid $39.0 million for the outstanding accounts receivable and February collections.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P100_S3	The securitization programs no longer offered an attractive financing alternative.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P101_S0	In September 2009, the Company sold its hemofiltration product line.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P101_S1	Under the terms of the agreement, the Company received a cash payment of $55.9 million, and would receive up to an additional $9.0 million upon the buyer's achievement of certain revenue objectives over the two years following the sale, $6.6 million of which had been received as of December 31, 2010.

1099800_11_ITEM7_P102_S2	In December 2008, the Company recorded a gain of $23.0 million for the receipt of a LifeStent milestone payment in connection with the transfer of its pre-market approval to the buyer.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P102_S3	In February 2009, the Company received an additional $27.0 million milestone payment associated with the LifeStent pre-market approval.

1099800_11_ITEM7_P103_S0	In July 2008, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions up to $250.0 million of the Company's common stock.

1099800_11_ITEM7_P103_S2	Stock repurchased under these programs has been used primarily to offset obligations under the Company's employee stock incentive programs and reduce the total shares outstanding.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P103_S3	During 2010, the Company repurchased 4.1 million shares (as adjusted to reflect the May 2010 two-for-one stock split) at an aggregate cost of $200.0 million and has remaining authority under the February 2010 program to purchase $398.0 million of the Company's common stock.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P104_S0	Net cash flows provided by operating activities of $251.4 million for 2010 increased $86.1 million from 2009 primarily due to (1) a $39.0 million cash payment during 2009 to terminate the Company's accounts receivable securitization program in Japan, (2) lower supplier payments in 2010 compared to 2009 and (3) higher operating profits.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P104_S1	These increases were partially offset by higher inventory purchases in 2010, primarily related to the transcatheter heart valve product line, and the negative impact from increased excess tax benefits from stock plans due to the appreciation in the Company's stock price and increased exercises (which is offset in financing activities).
1099800_11_ITEM7_P105_S0	Net cash flows provided by operating activities of $165.3 million for 2009 increased $12.1 million from 2008 primarily due to a $50.0 million cash payment during 2008 to terminate the Company's accounts receivable securitization program in the United States, compared to a $39.0 million cash payment during 2009 to terminate the Company's accounts receivable securitization program in Japan.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P105_S1	In addition, 2009 operating cash flow was positively impacted by higher operating profits and lower tax payments, offset by net cash outflows resulting from a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in 2009.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P106_S0	Net cash used in investing activities of $61.5 million in 2010 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $61.8 million.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P107_S0	Net cash provided by investing activities of $40.1 million in 2009 consisted primarily of $55.9 million of cash received from the sale of the hemofiltration product line, $42.0 million of cash received for milestone achievements associated with the LifeStent pre-market approval, and $11.4 million in cash redemptions associated with the Bank of America Columbia Strategic Cash fund, partially offset by capital expenditures of $64.0 million.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P108_S0	Net cash used in financing activities of $103.9 million in 2010 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of $200.0 million and net payments on debt of $48.4 million, partially offset by the proceeds from stock plans of $92.1 million and the excess tax benefit from stock plans of $55.1 million, which increased compared to the prior year due to the appreciation in the Company's stock price and increased exercises.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P109_S0	Net cash used in financing activities of $91.8 million in 2009 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of $95.5 million and net payments on debt of $84.6 million, partially offset by the proceeds from stock plans of $66.7 million and the excess tax benefit from stock plans of $20.6 million.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P110_S0	A summary of all of the Company's contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2010 were as follows (in millions):
1099800_11_ITEM7_P111_S0	The amount included in "Less Than 1 Year" reflects anticipated contributions to the Company's various pension plans.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P111_S1	Anticipated contributions beyond one year are not determinable.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P111_S2	The total accrued benefit liability for the Company's pension plans recognized as of December 31, 2010 was $33.4 million.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P111_S3	This amount is impacted by, among other items, pension expense funding levels, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and investment return on plan assets.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P111_S4	Therefore, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid, and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P111_S5	See Note 10 to the " Consolidated Financial Statements " for further information.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P112_S0	(b) Contractual development obligations consist primarily of cash that the Company is obligated to pay upon achievement of product development and other milestones.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P112_S1	(c) Capital commitment obligations consist primarily of cash that the Company is obligated to pay to its limited partnership and limited liability corporation investees.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P112_S2	These investees make equity investments in various development stage biopharmaceutical and medical device companies, and it is not certain if and/or when these payments will be made.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P112_S3	(d) As of December 31, 2010, the liability for uncertain tax positions including interest was $58.2 million.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P112_S4	As a result of on-going negotiations of Advanced Pricing Agreements between Switzerland and the United States and between Japan and the United States, the expiration of statutes of limitations, and the possible settlement of on-going audits in several jurisdictions for multiple years throughout the world, the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P112_S5	The range of such change could vary, but the amount of such change is not expected to be material.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P113_S0	The Company's results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of the Company's accounting policies, as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P114_S0	Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America ("GAAP").
1099800_11_ITEM7_P114_S1	In evaluating the Company's transactions, management assesses all relevant GAAP and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P115_S0	The application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P115_S1	As it relates to the Company, estimates and forecasts are required to determine sales returns and reserves, rebate reserves, allowances for doubtful accounts, reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, investments in unconsolidated affiliates, the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, the allocation of purchase price for acquisitions, workers' compensation liabilities, employee benefit related liabilities, income taxes, impairments of assets, forecasted transactions to be hedged, litigation reserves and contingencies.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P116_S0	These matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain, and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P116_S1	Management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements, using historical experience and all available information.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P116_S2	The Company also uses outside experts where appropriate.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P117_S0	The Company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P118_S0	The Company believes the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on the Company's reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P119_S0	The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P120_S0	Revenue is considered realized or realizable and earned upon delivery of the product, provided that an agreement of sale exists, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P120_S1	In the case of certain products where the Company maintains consigned inventory at customer locations, revenue is recognized at the time the Company is notified that the customer has used the inventory.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P121_S0	The Company's sales terms are standard terms within the medical device industry, with title and risk of loss transferring upon delivery to the customer, limited right of return and no unusual provisions or conditions.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P121_S1	When the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products, an estimate of various sales returns and allowances is recorded which reduces product sales and accounts receivable.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P121_S2	These adjustments include estimates for rebates, returns and other sales allowances.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P121_S3	These provisions are estimated and recorded at the time of sale based upon historical payment experience, historical relationship to revenues, estimated customer inventory levels, and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P121_S4	Product returns are not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P121_S5	If the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not approximate future activity, the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be impacted.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P122_S0	The Company's primary sales adjustment relates to distributor rebates which are given to the Company's United States distributors and represents the difference between the Company's sales price to the distributor (at the Company's distributor "list price") and the negotiated price to be paid by the end-customer.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P122_S1	This distributor rebate is recorded by the Company as a reduction to sales and a reduction to the distributor's accounts receivable at the time of sale to a distributor.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P122_S2	The Company validates the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from its distributors or an estimate of its distributor's inventory.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P122_S3	This distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P122_S4	The Company periodically monitors current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the liability for future distributor rebates is fairly stated.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P123_S0	The Company also offers volume rebates to certain GPOs and customers based upon target sales levels.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P123_S1	For volume rebates offered to GPOs, the rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and an obligation to the GPO.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P124_S0	The provision for volume rebates is estimated based on customers' contracted rebate programs and historical experience of rebates paid.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P124_S1	The Company periodically monitors its customer rebate programs to ensure that the allowance and liability for accrued rebates is fairly stated.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P125_S0	The Company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer-specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P125_S1	Additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances, if economic conditions are less favorable than the Company has anticipated, or for customer-specific circumstances, such as financial difficulty.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P125_S2	The allowance for doubtful accounts was $11.6 million and $12.4 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P126_S0	The Company records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P126_S1	Additional inventory allowances may be required if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the Company has estimated.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P127_S0	A write-down for excess or inactive inventory is recorded for inventory which is obsolete, nearing its expiration date (generally triggered at six months prior to expiration), is damaged or slow moving (defined as quantities in excess of a two year supply).
1099800_11_ITEM7_P127_S1	The allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was $11.2 million and $10.9 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P128_S0	The Company expenses legal costs incurred for patent preparation and applications.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P128_S1	The Company capitalizes certain legal costs related to the defense and enforcement of issued patents and trademarks.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P128_S2	These capitalized legal costs are amortized over the life of the related patent or trademark.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P128_S3	Such legal costs are periodically reviewed for impairment and recoverability.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P129_S0	The Company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P129_S1	In evaluating goodwill, the Company completes a two-step goodwill impairment test.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P129_S2	The Company identifies its reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities, including existing goodwill, to those reporting units.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P129_S3	The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based on the Company's market capitalization and a market revenue multiple.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P129_S4	If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company will perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P130_S0	The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill with its carrying value.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P130_S1	In 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company did not perform the second step of the impairment test as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P131_S0	Additionally, management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and long-lived tangible assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P131_S1	Impairment indicators include, among other conditions, cash flow deficits, historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit, and adverse legal or regulatory developments.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P131_S2	If it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable, based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization periods, their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P132_S0	Estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P132_S1	For the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment, long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P133_S0	Investments in unconsolidated affiliates are long-term equity investments in companies that are in various stages of development.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P133_S1	Certain of these investments are designated as available-for-sale.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P133_S2	Gains or losses on investments sold are based on the specific identification method.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P133_S3	Other investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for under the cost or the equity method of accounting, as appropriate.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P134_S0	The Company accounts for investments in limited partnerships or limited liability corporations, whereby the Company owns a minimum of 5% of the investee's outstanding voting stock, under the equity method of accounting.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P134_S1	These investments are recorded at the amount of the Company's investment and adjusted each period for the Company's share of the investee's income or loss and dividends paid.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P134_S2	As investments accounted for under the cost method do not have readily determinable fair value, the Company only estimates fair value if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that could have a significant adverse effect on the investment's fair value.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P135_S0	When the fair value of an available-for-sale investment declines below cost, management uses the following criteria to determine if such a decline should be considered other-than-temporary and result in a recognized loss:
1099800_11_ITEM7_P136_S0	the duration and extent to which the market value has been less than cost; the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee; the reasons for the decline in market value; the investee's performance against product development milestones; and the Company's ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P137_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P137_S1	The Company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P137_S2	The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the Company's forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P137_S3	Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the Company's effective tax rate on future earnings.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P138_S0	The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P138_S1	Significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company's uncertain tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P138_S2	The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that a position would more likely than not be sustained based upon its technical merit if challenged by the relevant taxing authority and taken by management to the court of last resort.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P138_S3	For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the relevant tax authority.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P139_S0	The Company strives to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P139_S1	While the Company has accrued for amounts it believes are the probable outcomes, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P139_S2	Furthermore, the Company may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise its right to appeal.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P140_S0	lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation, regulations or case law.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P140_S1	Management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from these uncertain tax positions.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P141_S0	As a result of on-going negotiations of various Advanced Pricing Agreements, the expiration of statutes of limitations, and the possible settlement of on-going audits in several jurisdictions for multiple years throughout the world, the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P141_S1	The range of such change could vary, but the amount of such change is not expected to be material.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P142_S0	The Company has significant California research expenditure tax credits it expects to use in future periods.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P142_S1	The credits may be carried forward indefinitely.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P142_S2	Based upon anticipated future taxable income, the Company expects all California research expenditure tax credits to be fully utilized; accordingly, no valuation allowance has been provided.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P143_S0	The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based awards based on estimated fair values.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P143_S1	Stock-based awards consist of stock options, restricted stock units and employee stock purchase subscriptions.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P143_S2	The fair value of each option award and employee stock purchase subscription is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P143_S3	The Black-Scholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions, including stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected option term.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P143_S4	Stock-based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P143_S5	Judgment is required in estimating the stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P143_S6	If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and the Company's results of operations could be impacted.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P144_S0	In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an amendment to the accounting guidance on revenue recognition to require companies to allocate revenue in arrangements involving multiple deliverables based on estimated selling price in the absence of vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of selling price for the deliverables.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P144_S1	The guidance was also amended to eliminate the requirement that all undelivered elements must have objective and reliable evidence of fair value before a company can recognize the portion of the overall arrangement fee that is attributable to items that have already been delivered.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P144_S2	The guidance is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P144_S3	The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P145_S0	In January 2010, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting guidance on fair value disclosures to require companies to (a) disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and describe the reasons for such transfers and (b) present separately in the Level 3 reconciliation information about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P145_S1	The guidance also clarifies the level of disaggregation to present and disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P145_S2	The guidance was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the Level 3 reconciliation, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those years.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P145_S3	The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2010, other than those provisions related to the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the Level 3 reconciliation.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P146_S0	In April 2010, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting guidance on revenue recognition to provide guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research and development transactions.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P147_S0	milestone is achieved only if the milestone meets all criteria to be considered substantive.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P147_S1	The guidance is effective for milestones achieved in fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after June 15, 2010.
1099800_11_ITEM7_P147_S2	The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1099800_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The Company's business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets, including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates.
1099800_11_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The Company manages these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments.
1099800_11_ITEM7A_P0_S2	The Company uses forward currency exchange contracts and option-based products to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates.
1099800_11_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Historically, the Company has used interest rate swap contracts to manage its exposure to interest rate changes.
1099800_11_ITEM7A_P0_S4	The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1099800_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	In addition to available cash and cash from operations, the Company uses short- and long-term debt to finance business activities.
1099800_11_ITEM7A_P1_S1	The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its debt obligations.
1099800_11_ITEM7A_P1_S2	The Company is not currently using derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk since the risk is not considered significant.
1099800_11_ITEM7A_P1_S3	A hypothetical 10% increase in the Company's weighted-average interest rate would have an immaterial effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.
1099800_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The Company is exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations.
1099800_11_ITEM7A_P2_S1	These risks include the translation of local currency balances and results of the Company's non-United States subsidiaries into United States dollars, gains and losses related to intercompany and third-party transactions denominated in currencies other than a location's functional currency, and currency gains and losses associated with intercompany loans.
1099800_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The Company's principal currency exposures relate to the Japanese yen and the Euro.
1099800_11_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The Company's objective is to minimize the volatility of its exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and the use of derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options.
1099800_11_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The Company does not hedge its exposure related to its net investments in its non-United States subsidiaries.
1099800_11_ITEM7A_P3_S3	The total notional amounts of the Company's derivative financial instruments entered into for foreign currency management purposes at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $539.2 million and $343.1 million, respectively.
1099800_11_ITEM7A_P3_S4	A hypothetical 10% increase/decrease in the value of the United States dollar against all hedged currencies would increase/decrease the fair value of these derivative contracts by $44.4 million and $49.5 million, respectively.
1099800_11_ITEM7A_P3_S5	Any gains or losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would be offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions and would not be significant to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.
1099800_11_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Derivative financial instruments involve credit risk in the event the financial institution counterparty should default.
1099800_11_ITEM7A_P4_S1	It is the Company's policy to execute such instruments with major financial institutions that the Company believes to be creditworthy.
1099800_11_ITEM7A_P4_S2	At December 31, 2010, all derivative financial instruments were with banks assigned investment grade ratings of "A" or better by national rating agencies.
1099800_11_ITEM7A_P5_S0	further diversifies its derivative financial instruments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.
1099800_11_ITEM7A_P5_S1	The Company also uses International Swap Dealers Association master-netting agreements with all derivative counterparties.
1099800_11_ITEM7A_P5_S2	The master-netting agreements reduce the Company's counterparty settlement risk to the net amount of any receipts or payments due between the Company and the counterparty financial institutions.
1099800_11_ITEM7A_P5_S3	The Company has not experienced a counterparty default and does not anticipate any non-performance by the Company's current derivative counterparties.
1099800_11_ITEM7A_P6_S0	In the normal course of business, Edwards Lifesciences provides credit to customers in the healthcare industry, performs credit evaluations of these customers and maintains allowances for potential credit losses which have historically been adequate compared to actual losses.

1099800_11_ITEM8_P2_S3	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1099800_11_ITEM8_P2_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P2_S5	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P2_S6	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

1099800_11_ITEM8_P2_S8	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P3_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P3_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P4_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P4_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1099800_11_ITEM8_P16_S1	The Company distributed its treasury shares in addition to newly issued shares to effect the stock split.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P16_S2	All applicable share and per-share amounts in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the consolidated statements of operations have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this stock split.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P16_S3	The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2009 and the consolidated statements of stockholders' equity and comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 have not been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split.

1099800_11_ITEM8_P17_S1	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P17_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.

1099800_11_ITEM8_P20_S0	The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P21_S0	Revenue is considered realized or realizable and earned upon delivery of the product, provided that an agreement of sale exists, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P21_S1	In the case of certain products where the Company maintains consigned inventory at customer locations, revenue is recognized at the time the Company is notified that the customer has used the inventory.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P22_S0	The Company's sales terms are standard terms within the medical device industry, with title and risk of loss transferring upon delivery to the customer, limited right of return and no unusual provisions or conditions.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P22_S1	When the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products, an estimate of various sales returns and allowances is recorded which reduces product sales and accounts receivable.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P22_S2	These adjustments include estimates for rebates, returns and other sales allowances.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P22_S3	These provisions are estimated and recorded at the time of sale based upon historical payment experience, historical relationship to revenues, estimated customer inventory levels, and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P22_S4	Product returns are not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P22_S5	If the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not approximate future activity, the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be impacted.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P23_S0	The Company's primary sales adjustment relates to distributor rebates which are given to the Company's United States distributors and represents the difference between the Company's sales price to the distributor (at the Company's distributor "list price") and the negotiated price to be paid by the end-customer.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P23_S1	This distributor rebate is recorded by the Company as a reduction to sales and a reduction to the distributor's accounts receivable at the time of sale to a distributor.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P23_S2	The Company validates the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from its distributors or an estimate of its distributor's inventory.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P23_S3	This distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P23_S4	The Company periodically monitors current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the liability for future distributor rebates is fairly stated.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P24_S0	The Company also offers volume rebates to certain group purchasing organizations ("GPOs") and customers based upon target sales levels.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P24_S1	For volume rebates offered to GPOs, the rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and an obligation to the GPO.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P25_S0	recorded as a reduction to sales and accounts receivable.

1099800_11_ITEM8_P25_S2	The Company periodically monitors its customer rebate programs to ensure that the allowance and liability for accrued rebates is fairly stated.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P26_S0	The Company considers highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P26_S1	These investments are valued at cost, which approximates fair value.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P27_S0	The Company held an investment in the Bank of America Columbia Strategic Cash fund, a private placement money market mutual fund, which was closed to new subscriptions or redemptions in December 2007, resulting in the Company's inability to immediately redeem its investments for cash.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P27_S1	During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company received cash redemptions fully redeeming its remaining investment in this fund.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P28_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market value.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P28_S1	Market value for raw materials is based on replacement costs, and for other inventory classifications is based on net realizable value.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P29_S0	A write-down for excess or inactive inventory is recorded for inventory which is obsolete, nearing its expiration date (generally triggered at six months prior to expiration), is damaged or slow moving (defined as quantities in excess of a two year supply).
1099800_11_ITEM8_P29_S1	The allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was $11.2 million and $10.9 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

1099800_11_ITEM8_P31_S0	Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P31_S1	Depreciation is principally calculated for financial reporting purposes on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from 10 to 40 years for buildings and improvements, from 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment, and from 3 to 10 years for software.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P31_S2	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the related facility leases or the asset, whichever is shorter.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P31_S3	Straight-line and accelerated methods of depreciation are used for income tax purposes.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P32_S0	Depreciation expense for property, plant and equipment was $40.0 million, $38.0 million and $36.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

1099800_11_ITEM8_P34_S0	The Company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P34_S1	In evaluating goodwill, the Company completes a two-step goodwill impairment test.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P34_S2	The Company identifies its reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities, including existing goodwill, to those reporting units.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P34_S3	The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based on the Company's market capitalization and a market revenue multiple.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P34_S4	If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company will perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P35_S0	The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill with its carrying value.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P35_S1	In 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company did not perform the second step of the impairment test as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P36_S0	Additionally, management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and long-lived tangible assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P36_S1	Impairment indicators include, among other conditions, cash flow deficits, historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit, and adverse legal or regulatory developments.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P36_S2	If it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable, based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization periods, their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P37_S0	Estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P37_S1	For the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment, long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P38_S0	The Company expenses legal costs incurred for patent preparation and applications.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P38_S1	The Company capitalizes certain legal costs related to the defense and enforcement of issued patents and trademarks.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P38_S2	These capitalized legal costs are amortized over the life of the related patent or trademark.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P38_S3	Such legal costs are periodically reviewed for impairment and recoverability.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P39_S0	Investments in unconsolidated affiliates are long-term equity investments in companies that are in various stages of development.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P39_S1	Certain of these investments are designated as available-for-sale.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P39_S2	Gains or losses on investments sold are based on the specific identification method.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P39_S3	Other investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for under the cost or the equity method of accounting, as appropriate.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P40_S0	The Company accounts for investments in limited partnerships or limited liability corporations, whereby the Company owns a minimum of 5% of the investee's outstanding voting stock, under the equity method of accounting.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P40_S1	These investments are recorded at the amount of the Company's investment and adjusted each period for the Company's share of the investee's income or loss and dividends paid.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P41_S0	value, the Company only estimates fair value if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that could have a significant adverse effect on the investment's fair value.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P42_S0	When the fair value of an available-for-sale investment declines below cost, management uses the following criteria to determine if such a decline should be considered other-than-temporary and result in a recognized loss:
1099800_11_ITEM8_P43_S0	the duration and extent to which the market value has been less than cost; the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee; the reasons for the decline in market value; the investee's performance against product development milestones; and the Company's ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P44_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P44_S1	The Company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P44_S2	The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the Company's forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P44_S3	Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the Company's effective tax rate on future earnings.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P45_S0	The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P45_S1	Significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company's uncertain tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P45_S2	The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that a position would more likely than not be sustained based upon its technical merit if challenged by the relevant taxing authority and taken by management to the court of last resort.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P45_S3	For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the relevant tax authority.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P46_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P47_S0	Research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred.

1099800_11_ITEM8_P48_S1	The agreement provides Edwards Lifesciences with an exclusive license to DexCom's applicable intellectual property.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P48_S2	Product development costs under this agreement are expensed to " Research and Development Expenses " as incurred.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P49_S0	DexCom will receive either a profit-sharing payment or a royalty based upon commercial sales.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P50_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company recorded $4.2 million and $5.5 million of product development costs, respectively.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P51_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average common shares outstanding during a period.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P51_S1	Employee equity share options, nonvested shares and similar equity instruments granted by the Company are treated as potential common shares in computing diluted earnings per share.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P51_S2	Diluted shares outstanding include the dilutive effect of the conversion of convertible debt, restricted stock units and in-the-money options.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P52_S0	The dilutive impact of the restricted stock units and in-the-money options is calculated based on the average share price for each fiscal period using the treasury stock method.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P52_S1	Under the treasury stock method, the amount that the employee must pay for exercising stock options, the amount of compensation expense for future service that the Company has not yet recognized, and the amount of tax benefits that would be recorded in " Additional Paid-In Capital " when the award becomes deductible are assumed to be used to repurchase shares.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P52_S2	Potential common share equivalents have been excluded where their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P53_S0	The table below presents the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (in millions, except for per share information):
1099800_11_ITEM8_P54_S0	Stock options and restricted stock units to purchase approximately 0.9 million, 1.9 million and 3.8 million shares for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, were outstanding, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P54_S1	Diluted shares included shares issuable pursuant to the Company's convertible debentures until they were redeemed on June 9, 2008.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P55_S0	The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based awards based on estimated fair values.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P55_S1	Stock-based awards consist of stock options, restricted stock units and employee stock purchase subscriptions.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P55_S2	Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period (vesting period).

1099800_11_ITEM8_P190_S1	These liabilities could be reduced by $4.7 million and $3.2 million, respectively, from offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes and timing adjustments.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P190_S2	The net amounts of $50.4 million and $44.0 million, respectively, if recognized, would favorably affect the Company's effective tax rate.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P191_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest, penalties and foreign exchange, is as follows (in millions):
1099800_11_ITEM8_P192_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes.

1099800_11_ITEM8_P194_S2	The uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation, regulations or case law.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P194_S3	Management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from these uncertain tax positions.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P195_S0	As a result of on-going negotiations of Advanced Pricing Agreements between Switzerland and the United States and between Japan and the United States, the expiration of statutes of limitations, and the possible settlement of on-going audits in several jurisdictions for multiple years throughout the world, the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P195_S1	The range of such change could vary, but the amount of such change is not expected to be material.

1099800_11_ITEM8_P197_S1	The tax benefits that result from reductions in the value of these investments are contingent on the Company realizing sufficient capital gains in the appropriate period with which to offset these expected capital losses.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P197_S2	Due to the uncertainty of the ready marketability of certain of these impaired investments, the Company has recorded valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets as they have accumulated.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P197_S3	As of December 31, 2010, deferred tax assets and corresponding valuation allowances of approximately $3.1 million had accumulated related to investments.

("CoreValve") in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that its ReValving System infringes three of the Company's U.S. Andersen patents, later narrowed to one patent ("the '552 patent").
1099800_11_ITEM8_P199_S1	CoreValve was acquired by Medtronic, Inc. ("Medtronic") in April 2009.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P200_S0	In April 2010, a federal jury found that patent to be valid and found that CoreValve willfully infringes it.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P201_S0	In February 2011, the District Court reaffirmed the jury decision and ruled that Edwards is entitled to recover additional damages due to CoreValve's continued infringing sales from the trial through the life of the patent, plus interest.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P201_S1	In the same ruling, the court denied Edwards' motions for a permanent injunction and increased damages relating to CoreValve's willful infringement.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P201_S2	CoreValve has appealed and Edwards plans to file a cross-appeal.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P201_S3	A second lawsuit is pending in the same court against CoreValve and Medtronic alleging infringement of three U.S. Andersen patents.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P201_S4	In September 2010, the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted Medtronic's third request to reexamine the validity of the claim of the '552 patent and later issued an initial Office Action rejecting the claim of the '552 patent.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P202_S0	Earlier, in May 2007, the Company filed a lawsuit against CoreValve alleging infringement of the Company's European Andersen patent.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P202_S1	The lawsuit was filed in the District Patent Court in Dusseldorf, Germany, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P202_S2	In October 2008, the Court rejected this assertion and dismissed the infringement lawsuit.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P202_S3	In February 2010, a German Appeals Court affirmed.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P203_S0	In May 2007 and June 2007, CoreValve filed separate lawsuits in London, United Kingdom, and Munich, Germany, respectively, alleging the patent to be invalid.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P203_S1	The Company then asserted that CoreValve's ReValving System infringes the Andersen patent in the United Kingdom.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P203_S2	In January 2009, the United Kingdom Court determined that the Andersen patent is valid but not infringed by CoreValve.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P203_S3	In May 2010, a United Kingdom Appeals Court affirmed the lower court.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P203_S4	In January 2010, the German Courts also determined that the Andersen patent is valid.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P203_S5	In December 2010, these lawsuits were resolved pursuant to a confidential settlement between the parties.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P204_S0	In February 2008, Cook, Inc. ("Cook") filed a lawsuit in the District Patent Court in Dusseldorf, Germany, against Edwards Lifesciences alleging that the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve infringes on a Cook patent.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P204_S1	Edwards Lifesciences subsequently filed lawsuits in London, United Kingdom, and in Munich, Germany, against Cook alleging that the patents were invalid.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P204_S2	In the United Kingdom lawsuit, Cook counterclaimed, alleging infringement by Edwards.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P204_S3	In March 2009, the German Courts ruled that the Company does not infringe the Cook patent.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P204_S4	In June 2009, the United Kingdom Court also ruled that the Company does not infringe the Cook patent and, further, that the Cook patent is invalid.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P204_S5	In June 2010, a United Kingdom Appeals Court affirmed.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P204_S6	In April 2010, the German Courts also determined that the Cook patent is invalid.

1099800_11_ITEM8_P205_S2	The Company is cooperating fully with the investigation.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P206_S0	In addition, Edwards Lifesciences is or may be a party to, or may otherwise be responsible for, pending or threatened lawsuits related primarily to products and services currently or formerly manufactured or performed, as applicable, by Edwards Lifesciences.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P206_S1	Such cases and claims raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the facts and circumstances of each particular case or claim, the jurisdiction in which each suit is brought, and differences in applicable law.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P206_S2	Upon resolution of any such legal matter or other claim, Edwards Lifesciences may incur charges in excess of established reserves.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P207_S0	does not believe that any such charge relating to any currently pending lawsuit would have a material adverse effect on Edwards Lifesciences' financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

1099800_11_ITEM8_P209_S0	The operations of Edwards Lifesciences, like those of other medical device companies, involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P209_S1	While it is difficult to quantify the potential impact of continuing compliance with environmental protection laws, management believes that such compliance will not have a material impact on Edwards Lifesciences' financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P210_S0	Edwards Lifesciences conducts operations worldwide and is managed in the following geographical regions: United States, Europe, Japan and Rest of World.

1099800_11_ITEM8_P211_S3	The accounting policies of the segments are substantially the same as those described in Note 2.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P211_S4	Net sales and pre-tax income of reportable segments are based on internally derived standard foreign exchange rates, which may differ from year to year, and do not include inter-segment profits.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P211_S5	Because of the interdependence of the reportable segments, the operating profit as presented may not be representative of the geographical distribution that would occur if the segments were not interdependent.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P212_S0	Certain items are maintained at the corporate level and are not allocated to the segments.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P212_S1	The non-allocated items include net interest expense, global marketing expenses, corporate research and development expenses, United States manufacturing variances, corporate headquarters costs, in-process research and development, special gains and charges, stock-based compensation, foreign currency hedging activities, certain litigation costs and most of the Company's amortization expense.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P212_S2	Although most of the Company's depreciation expense is included in segment pre-tax income, due to the Company's methodology for cost build-up, it is impractical to determine the amount of depreciation expense included in each segment, and therefore a portion is maintained at the corporate level.
1099800_11_ITEM8_P213_S0	The Company neither discretely allocates assets to its operating segments, nor evaluates the operating segments using discrete asset information.

1099800_11_ITEM15_P242_S0	In connection with the Annual Report of Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (the "Company") on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof (the "Report"), we, Michael A. Mussallem, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and Thomas M. Abate, Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, certify, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that:
1099800_11_ITEM15_P243_S0	(1) The Report fully complies with the requirements of section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and (2) The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P0_S0	For the Years Ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009:
1099800_12_ITEM8_P1_S0	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Edwards Lifesciences Corporation:
1099800_12_ITEM8_P2_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Edwards Lifesciences Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P2_S1	Also in our opinion, the Company did not maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) because a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to the effective controls not being in place with respect to communication to appropriate financial reporting personnel from other departments of changes to information impacting classification and disclosures in the financial statements existed as of that date.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P2_S2	A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P2_S3	The material weakness referred to above is described in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P2_S4	We considered this material weakness in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2011 consolidated financial statements, and our opinion regarding the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting does not affect our opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P2_S5	The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in management's report referred to above.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P2_S6	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P2_S7	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1099800_12_ITEM8_P2_S8	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P2_S9	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P2_S10	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P2_S11	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P2_S12	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P3_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P3_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P4_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P4_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1099800_12_ITEM8_P9_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P10_S0	Edwards Lifesciences Corporation ("Edwards Lifesciences" or the "Company") conducts operations worldwide and is managed in the following geographical regions: United States, Europe, Japan and Rest of World.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P10_S1	Edwards Lifesciences is a global leader in the science of heart valves and hemodynamic monitoring.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P10_S2	The Company develops innovative technologies in the areas of structural heart disease and critical care monitoring.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P11_S0	The products and technologies provided by Edwards Lifesciences to treat advanced cardiovascular disease or critically ill patients are categorized into the following main areas: Heart Valve Therapy; Critical Care; Cardiac Surgery Systems; and Vascular.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P11_S1	The Company's Heart Valve Therapy products include tissue heart valves and heart valve repair products.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P11_S2	The Critical Care products include hemodynamic monitoring systems used to measure a patient's cardiovascular function, and disposable pressure transducers.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P12_S0	Prior to September 2009, Edwards Lifesciences provided products for continuous renal replacement therapy ("hemofiltration product line").
1099800_12_ITEM8_P12_S1	The Company sold the hemofiltration product line in September 2009.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P13_S0	The Company's Cardiac Surgery Systems products include a diverse line of products for use during cardiac surgery, including cannulae, embolic protection devices and other products used during cardiopulmonary bypass procedures.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P13_S1	Cardiac Surgery Systems also includes the Company's minimally invasive surgery product line.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P13_S2	The Vascular products include a line of balloon catheter-based products, surgical clips and inserts, and, until the first quarter of 2011, artificial implantable grafts.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P14_S0	Edwards Lifesciences manufactured and sold LifeStent balloon-expandable and self-expanding non-coronary stents until the sale of this product line in January 2008.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P14_S1	The Company continued to manufacture these products for the buyer until September 2009 when manufacturing was transferred to the buyer.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P15_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Edwards Lifesciences and its majority-owned subsidiaries.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P15_S1	All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P16_S0	The consolidated financial statements of Edwards Lifesciences have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") which have been applied consistently in all material respects.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P16_S1	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P16_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P16_S3	Estimates are used in accounting for, among other items, sales returns and reserves, rebate reserves, allowances for doubtful accounts, reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, investments in unconsolidated affiliates, the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, the allocation of purchase price for acquisitions, workers compensation liabilities, employee benefit-related liabilities, income taxes, asset impairments, forecasted transactions to be hedged, litigation reserves and contingencies.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P17_S0	When the local currency of the Company's foreign entities is the functional currency, all assets and liabilities are translated into United States dollars at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P17_S1	Income and expense items are translated at the weighted-average exchange rate prevailing during the period.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P18_S0	The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P19_S0	Revenue is considered realized or realizable and earned upon delivery of the product, provided that an agreement of sale exists, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P19_S1	In the case of certain products where the Company maintains consigned inventory at customer locations, revenue is recognized at the time the Company is notified that the customer has used the inventory.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P20_S0	The Company's sales terms are standard terms within the medical device industry, with title and risk of loss transferring upon delivery to the customer, limited right of return and no unusual provisions or conditions.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P20_S1	When the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products, an estimate of various sales returns and allowances is recorded which reduces product sales and accounts receivable.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P20_S2	These adjustments include estimates for rebates, returns and other sales allowances.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P20_S3	These provisions are estimated and recorded at the time of sale based upon historical payment experience, historical relationship to revenues, estimated customer inventory levels, and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P20_S4	Product returns are not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P20_S5	If the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not approximate future activity, the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be impacted.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P21_S0	The Company's primary sales adjustment relates to distributor rebates which are given to the Company's United States distributors and represents the difference between the Company's sales price to the distributor (at the Company's distributor "list price") and the negotiated price to be paid by the end-customer.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P21_S1	This distributor rebate is recorded by the Company as a reduction to sales and a reduction to the distributor's accounts receivable at the time of sale to a distributor.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P21_S2	The Company validates the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from its distributors or an estimate of its distributor's inventory.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P21_S3	This distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P21_S4	The Company periodically monitors current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the credit for future distributor rebates is fairly stated.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P22_S0	The Company also offers volume rebates to certain group purchasing organizations ("GPOs") and customers based upon target sales levels.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P22_S1	For volume rebates offered to GPOs, the rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and an obligation to the GPO.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P22_S2	For volume rebates offered to customers, the rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and accounts receivable.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P22_S3	The provision for volume rebates is estimated based on customers' contracted rebate programs and historical experience of rebates paid.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P22_S4	The Company periodically monitors its customer rebate programs to ensure that the allowance and liability for accrued rebates is fairly stated.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P23_S0	The Company considers highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P23_S1	These investments are valued at cost, which approximates fair value.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P24_S0	The Company invests in bank time deposits.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P24_S1	Bank time deposits with original maturities of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents, and bank time deposits with original maturities over three months are classified as short-term investments.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P24_S2	Investments in bank time deposits are classified as held-to-maturity, as management has both the intent and ability to hold these investments to maturity, and are reported at cost, which approximates fair value.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P24_S3	Income relating to these bank time deposits is reported as interest income.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P25_S0	The Company held an investment in the Bank of America Columbia Strategic Cash fund, a private placement money market mutual fund, which was closed to new subscriptions or redemptions in December 2007, resulting in the Company's inability to immediately redeem its investments for cash.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P25_S1	During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company received cash redemptions fully redeeming its remaining investment in this fund.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P26_S0	The Company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer-specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P27_S0	The credit and economic conditions within Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece, among other members of the European Union, have deteriorated as these countries have experienced slower economic growth and higher debt levels.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P27_S1	When evaluating its allowances for doubtful accounts related to these European receivables, the Company's analysis considers a number of factors including evidence of the customer's ability to comply with credit terms, economic conditions and procedures implemented by the Company to collect the historical receivables.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P27_S2	Additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances, if economic conditions are less favorable than the Company has anticipated, or for customer-specific circumstances, such as financial difficulty.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P27_S3	The allowance for doubtful accounts was $19.0 million and $11.6 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P28_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market value.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P28_S1	Market value for raw materials is based on replacement costs, and for other inventory classifications is based on net realizable value.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P29_S0	A write-down for excess or inactive inventory is recorded for inventory which is obsolete, nearing its expiration date (generally triggered at six months prior to expiration), is damaged or slow moving (defined as quantities in excess of a two year supply).
1099800_12_ITEM8_P29_S1	The allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was $12.9 million and $11.2 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P30_S0	The Company allocates to inventory general and administrative costs that are related to the production process.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P30_S1	These costs include insurance, manufacturing accounting personnel, human resources and information technology.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P30_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company allocated $25.3 million, $23.4 million and $20.9 million, respectively, of general and administrative costs to inventory.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P30_S3	General and administrative costs included in inventory at December 31, 2011 and 2010 were $15.9 million and $12.0 million, respectively.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P31_S0	Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P31_S1	Depreciation is principally calculated for financial reporting purposes on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from 10 to 40 years for buildings and improvements, from 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment, and from 3 to 10 years for software.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P31_S2	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the related facility leases or the asset, whichever is shorter.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P31_S3	Straight-line and accelerated methods of depreciation are used for income tax purposes.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P32_S0	Depreciation expense for property, plant and equipment was $44.0 million, $40.0 million and $38.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P32_S1	Repairs and maintenance expense was $18.1 million, $16.1 million and $15.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P33_S0	The Company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P33_S1	In evaluating goodwill, the Company completes a two-step goodwill impairment test.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P33_S2	The Company identifies its reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities, including existing goodwill, to those reporting units.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P33_S3	The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based on the Company's market capitalization and a market revenue multiple.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P33_S4	If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company will perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P34_S0	The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill with its carrying value.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P34_S1	In 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company did not perform the second step of the impairment test as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P35_S0	Additionally, management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and long-lived tangible assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P35_S1	Impairment indicators include, among other conditions, cash flow deficits, historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit, and adverse legal or regulatory developments.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P35_S2	If it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable, based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization periods, their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P36_S0	Estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P36_S1	For the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment, long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P37_S0	The Company expenses legal costs incurred for patent preparation and applications.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P37_S1	The Company capitalizes certain legal costs related to the defense and enforcement of issued patents and trademarks.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P37_S2	These capitalized legal costs are amortized over the life of the related patent or trademark.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P37_S3	Such legal costs are periodically reviewed for impairment and recoverability.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P38_S0	Investments in unconsolidated affiliates are long-term equity investments in companies that are in various stages of development.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P38_S1	Certain of these investments are designated as available-for-sale.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P38_S2	Gains or losses on investments sold are based on the specific identification method.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P38_S3	Other investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for under the cost or the equity method of accounting, as appropriate.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Company accounts for investments in limited partnerships or limited liability corporations, whereby the Company owns a minimum of 5% of the investee's outstanding voting stock, under the equity method of accounting.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P39_S1	These investments are recorded at the amount of the Company's investment and adjusted each period for the Company's share of the investee's income or loss and dividends paid.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P39_S2	As investments accounted for under the cost method do not have readily determinable fair value, the Company only estimates fair value if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that could have a significant adverse effect on the investment's fair value.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P40_S0	When the fair value of an available-for-sale investment declines below cost, management uses the following criteria to determine if such a decline should be considered other-than-temporary and result in a recognized loss:
1099800_12_ITEM8_P41_S0	the duration and extent to which the market value has been less than cost; the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee; the reasons for the decline in market value; the investee's performance against product development milestones; and the Company's ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P42_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P42_S1	The Company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and adjusting the amount, if necessary.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P42_S2	The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are both historical experience and the Company's forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P42_S3	Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the Company's effective tax rate on future earnings.

1099800_12_ITEM8_P184_S2	Based upon anticipated future taxable income, the Company expects all California research expenditure tax credits to be fully utilized; accordingly, no valuation allowance has been provided.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P185_S0	The United States state net operating loss carryforwards include $128.9 million of losses attributable to windfall stock option deductions.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P185_S1	A net benefit of $5.5 million will be recorded to " Additional Paid-In Capital " when realized as a reduction to income taxes payable.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P186_S0	Approximately $56.4 million of United States federal and state tax credit and charitable contribution carryforwards are attributable to windfall stock option deductions and will be recorded as a benefit to " Additional Paid-In Capital " when realized as a reduction to income taxes payable.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P187_S0	Deferred income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries of approximately $873.7 million as of December 31, 2011 since these amounts are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P187_S1	It is not practicable to calculate the deferred taxes associated with these earnings; however, foreign tax credits would likely be available to reduce federal income taxes in the event of distribution.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P187_S2	In evaluating this assertion, the Company evaluates, among other factors, the profitability of its United States and foreign operations and the need for cash within and outside the United States, including cash requirements for capital improvement, acquisitions, market expansion and stock repurchase programs.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P187_S3	Additionally, during 2010, the Company entered into a plan to repatriate all of the accumulated earnings from certain of its European subsidiaries that were previously considered to be indefinitely reinvested by the Company.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P187_S4	A tax benefit of $1.3 million resulted from the planned repatriation of the earnings in 2010.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P187_S5	The Company does not expect earnings in these European subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and records the tax impact in net income currently.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P188_S0	The Company has received tax incentives in Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Singapore and Switzerland.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P188_S1	The tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rates favorably impacted earnings per diluted share for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 by $0.40, $0.34 and $0.31, respectively.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P188_S2	The Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Singapore and Switzerland grants provide the Company's manufacturing operations partial or full exemption from local taxes until the years 2013, 2017, 2024 and 2015, respectively.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P188_S3	The Company is engaged in negotiations with the Puerto Rican government for an extension of the Puerto Rico grant.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P188_S4	The Singapore grant was extended during 2011 for an additional five years and will now terminate in 2024.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P189_S0	A reconciliation of the United States federal statutory income tax rate to the Company's effective income tax rate is as follows (in millions):
1099800_12_ITEM8_P190_S0	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions was $78.0 million and $55.1 million, respectively.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P190_S1	The Company estimates that these liabilities would be reduced by $6.8 million and $4.7 million, respectively, from offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes and timing adjustments.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P190_S2	The net amounts of $71.2 million and $50.4 million, respectively, if not required, would favorably affect the Company's effective tax rate.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P191_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest, penalties and foreign exchange, is as follows (in millions):
1099800_12_ITEM8_P192_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P192_S1	As of December 31, 2011, the Company had accrued $2.0 million (net of $1.2 million tax benefit) of interest related to uncertain tax positions, and as of December 31, 2010, the Company had accrued $1.7 million (net of $1.4 million tax benefit) of interest related to uncertain tax positions.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P193_S0	The Company strives to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P193_S1	While the Company has accrued for matters it believes are more likely than not to require settlement, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P194_S0	may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise its right to appeal.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P194_S1	The uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation, regulations or case law.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P195_S0	At December 31, 2011, all material state, local and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2006.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P195_S1	The Internal Revenue Service has completed its examination of the Company's 2007 and 2008 tax years for all matters except for certain transfer pricing issues.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P195_S2	The appeals process for those transfer pricing issues is on-going.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P196_S0	The Internal Revenue Service began its examination of the 2009 and 2010 tax years during the second quarter of 2011.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P197_S0	As a result of on-going negotiations of an Advanced Pricing Agreement between Switzerland and the United States, the expiration of statutes of limitations, and the possible settlement of on-going audits in several jurisdictions for multiple years throughout the world, the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P197_S1	The range of such change could vary, but the amount of such change is not expected to be material.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P198_S0	In February 2008, Edwards Lifesciences filed a lawsuit against CoreValve, Inc. ("CoreValve") in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that its ReValving System infringes three of the Company's U.S. Andersen patents, later narrowed to one patent ("the '552 patent").
1099800_12_ITEM8_P198_S1	CoreValve was acquired by Medtronic, Inc. ("Medtronic") in April 2009.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P199_S0	In April 2010, a federal jury found that patent to be valid and found that CoreValve willfully infringes it.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P199_S1	The jury also awarded Edwards $73.9 million in damages.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P199_S2	In February 2011, the District Court reaffirmed the jury decision and ruled that Edwards is entitled to recover additional damages due to CoreValve's continued infringing sales from the trial through the life of the patent, plus interest.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P199_S3	In the same ruling, the court denied Edwards' motions for a permanent injunction, as well as its motion for increased damages relating to CoreValve's willful infringement.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P199_S4	Both Edwards and CoreValve have appealed.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P199_S5	A second lawsuit is pending in the same court against CoreValve and Medtronic alleging infringement of three U.S. Andersen patents.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P199_S6	In September 2010, the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO") granted Medtronic's third request to reexamine the validity of the claim of the '552 patent and in July 2011 confirmed the validity of that patent.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P200_S0	In June 2011, Medtronic filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota alleging that certain surgical valve holders and a surgical embolic filter device infringe its patents.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P200_S1	Edwards counterclaimed against Medtronic, alleging that the Medtronic Contour 3D annuloplasty ring infringes an Edwards ring patent.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P200_S2	By the Order of a Magistrate Judge in January 2012, the lawsuit has been stayed pending the outcome of future reexamination findings by the USPTO.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P201_S0	In June 2011, Medtronic also filed another lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California alleging that the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve infringes a Medtronic patent.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P202_S0	Edwards counterclaimed against Medtronic, alleging that the Medtronic CoreValve heart valve infringes Edwards' U.S.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P202_S1	Edwards' counterclaim was subsequently transferred to the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P203_S0	In March and September 2010, the Company received grand jury subpoenas for documents from the United States Attorney's Office in the Central District of California in connection with an investigation by the Food and Drug Administration.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P203_S1	The subpoenas to the Company seek records relating to the Vigilance I Monitor model with software release 5.3 that was the subject of a voluntary field recall by the Company in June 2006.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P203_S2	The Company is cooperating fully with the investigation.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P204_S0	In addition, Edwards Lifesciences is or may be a party to, or may otherwise be responsible for, pending or threatened lawsuits related primarily to products and services currently or formerly manufactured or performed, as applicable, by Edwards Lifesciences.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P204_S1	Such cases and claims raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the facts and circumstances of each particular case or claim, the jurisdiction in which each suit is brought, and differences in applicable law.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P204_S2	Upon resolution of any such legal matter or other claim, Edwards Lifesciences may incur charges in excess of established reserves.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P204_S3	The Company is not able to estimate the amount or range of any loss for legal contingencies for which there is no reserve or additional loss for matters already reserved.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P204_S4	While any such charge could have a material adverse impact on Edwards Lifesciences' net income or cash flows in the period in which it is recorded or paid, management does not believe that any such charge relating to any currently pending lawsuit would have a material adverse effect on Edwards Lifesciences' financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P205_S0	Edwards Lifesciences is subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside of the United States.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P206_S0	The operations of Edwards Lifesciences, like those of other medical device companies, involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P206_S1	While it is difficult to quantify the potential impact of continuing compliance with environmental protection laws, management believes that such compliance will not have a material impact on Edwards Lifesciences' financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P207_S0	Edwards Lifesciences conducts operations worldwide and is managed in the following geographical regions: United States, Europe, Japan and Rest of World.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P207_S1	All regions sell products that are used to treat advanced cardiovascular disease.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P208_S0	The Company's geographic segments are reported based on the financial information provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (the Chief Executive Officer).
1099800_12_ITEM8_P208_S1	The Company evaluates the performance of its geographic segments based on net sales and income before provision for income taxes ("pre-tax income").
1099800_12_ITEM8_P208_S2	The accounting policies of the segments are substantially the same as those described in Note 2.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P208_S3	Net sales and pre-tax income of reportable segments are based on internally derived standard foreign exchange rates, which may differ from year to year, and do not include inter-segment profits.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P208_S4	Because of the interdependence of the reportable segments, the operating profit as presented may not be representative of the geographical distribution that would occur if the segments were not interdependent.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P209_S0	Net sales by geographic area are based on the location of the customer.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P210_S0	Certain items are maintained at the corporate level and are not allocated to the segments.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P210_S1	The non-allocated items include net interest expense, global marketing expenses, corporate research and development expenses, manufacturing variances, corporate headquarters costs, special gains and charges, stock-based compensation, foreign currency hedging activities, certain litigation costs and most of the Company's amortization expense.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P210_S2	Although most of the Company's depreciation expense is included in segment pre-tax income, due to the Company's methodology for cost build-up, it is impractical to determine the amount of depreciation expense included in each segment, and therefore a portion is maintained at the corporate level.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P211_S0	The Company neither discretely allocates assets to its operating segments, nor evaluates the operating segments using discrete asset information.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P212_S0	The table below presents information about Edwards Lifesciences' reportable segments (in millions):
1099800_12_ITEM8_P213_S0	The table below presents reconciliations of segment net sales to consolidated net sales and segment pre-tax income to consolidated pre-tax income (in millions):
1099800_12_ITEM8_P214_S0	Enterprise-wide information is based on foreign exchange rates used in the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P215_S0	(a) The second quarter of 2011 includes a $4.0 million charge to reflect the increased collection risk associated with the Company's receivables in Greece.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P216_S0	The fourth quarter of 2011 includes (1) an $8.8 million charge to reflect the increased risk associated with its southern European receivables, (2) a $5.5 million charge related primarily to severance associated with a global workforce realignment, and (3) a $3.3 million charge related to a litigation settlement.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P217_S0	(b) The second quarter of 2010 includes an $8.3 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets and clinical trial costs associated with the discontinued MONARC transcatheter mitral valve program.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P218_S0	The third quarter of 2010 includes a $3.9 million charge for the impairment of certain investments in unconsolidated affiliates.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P219_S0	The fourth quarter of 2010 includes a $7.2 million charge for realignment expenses related primarily to severance associated with a global workforce realignment and a $3.3 million charge for the impairment of certain investments in unconsolidated affiliates.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P220_S0	The deductions related to allowances for doubtful accounts represent accounts receivable which are written off and product which is returned from customers.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P221_S0	(b) Inventory reserves result from inventory which is obsolete, is nearing its expiration date (generally triggered at six months prior to expiration), is damaged or slow moving (defined as quantities in excess of a two year supply).
1099800_12_ITEM8_P222_S0	The deductions related to inventory reserves represent inventory that is disposed of or sold as part of a business transaction.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P222_S1	(c) The tax valuation allowances are provided for other-than-temporary impairments and unrealized losses related to certain unconsolidated affiliates that may not be recognized due to the uncertainty of the ready marketability of certain impaired investments, and net operating loss and credit carryforwards that may not be recognized due to insufficient taxable income.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P223_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company determined that its previously issued consolidated condensed balance sheets and consolidated condensed statements of cash flows for the quarters ended March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2011 contained errors related to (1) its cash equivalents and short-term investments and (2) the excess tax benefit from stock plans.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P223_S1	Neither of these errors had an impact on the consolidated condensed statements of operations.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P224_S0	First, during 2011, the Company purchased bank time deposits with original maturities over three months but less than one year.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P225_S0	classified as cash equivalents for the above mentioned periods and, accordingly, the Company has restated the presentation as reflected below.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P225_S1	The classification error had no impact on the Company's current assets.
1099800_12_ITEM8_P226_S0	Second, the amounts presented in the consolidated condensed statements of cash flows as " Excess Tax Benefits from Stock Plans " for the periods ended June 30 and September 30, 2011 were not reduced to reflect the absence of cash flows from the generation of credit carryforwards and net operating losses in the United States in 2011 primarily due to significant tax deductions from stock option exercises and, accordingly, the Company has restated the presentation as reflected below.

1099800_12_ITEM1_P1_S0	Edwards Lifesciences Corporation is a global leader in the science of heart valves and hemodynamic monitoring.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P1_S1	Driven by a passion to help patients, the Company partners with clinicians to develop innovative technologies in the areas of structural heart disease and critical care monitoring that enable them to save and enhance lives.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	Cardiovascular disease is the number-one cause of death in the world, and is the top disease in terms of health care spending in nearly every country.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	Cardiovascular disease is progressive in that it tends to worsen over time and often affects an individual's entire circulatory system.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P3_S1	In its later stages, cardiovascular disease is frequently treated by surgical interventions or less invasive therapies.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	The products and technologies provided by Edwards Lifesciences to treat advanced cardiovascular disease or critically ill patients are categorized into four main areas: Heart Valve Therapy; Critical Care; Cardiac Surgery Systems; and Vascular.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	Patients undergoing surgical treatment for cardiovascular disease may be treated using a variety of Edwards Lifesciences' products and technologies.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P5_S1	For example, an individual with a heart valve disorder may have a faulty valve.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P5_S2	A clinician may elect to remove the valve and replace it with one of Edwards Lifesciences' bioprosthetic surgical tissue heart valves, surgically re-shape and repair the faulty valve with an Edwards Lifesciences annuloplasty ring, or deploy an Edwards Lifesciences transcatheter valve via a minimally invasive catheter-based system.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	Virtually all high-risk patients in the operating room or intensive care unit are candidates for having their cardiac function monitored by Edwards Lifesciences' Critical Care products.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P6_S1	If a patient undergoes open-heart surgery, Edwards Lifesciences' Cardiac Surgery Systems products may be used while the patient's heart and lung functions are being bypassed, or used during minimally invasive valve surgery.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P6_S2	If the circulatory problems are in the limbs rather than in the heart, the patient's procedure may involve some of Edwards Lifesciences' Vascular products, which include various types of balloon-tipped catheters that are used to remove blood clots from diseased blood vessels.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	Edwards Lifesciences Corporation was incorporated in Delaware on September 10, 1999.

1099800_12_ITEM1_P9_S1	The contents of the Company's website are not incorporated by reference into this report.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	The following discussion summarizes the main categories of products and technologies offered by Edwards Lifesciences to treat advanced cardiovascular disease.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	Edwards Lifesciences is the global leader in heart valve therapy and the world's leading manufacturer of tissue heart valves and repair products, which are used to replace or repair a patient's diseased or defective heart valve.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P11_S1	The Company produces pericardial and porcine valves from biologically inert animal tissue sewn onto proprietary wireform stents.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	The core of Edwards Lifesciences' surgical tissue heart valve product line is the Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNT pericardial valve, including the line of PERIMOUNT Magna valves, the newest generation pericardial valves for aortic and mitral replacement.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	With their proven durability and performance, PERIMOUNT valves are the most widely prescribed tissue heart valves in the world.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P12_S2	The durability of Edwards Lifesciences' tissue valves is extended through the use of its proprietary ThermaFix and XenoLogiX tissue treatment processes.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P12_S3	Edwards Lifesciences also sells porcine valves and stentless tissue valves.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	In addition to its replacement valves, Edwards Lifesciences pioneered and is the worldwide leader in heart valve repair therapies, including annuloplasty rings and systems.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P13_S1	The Company has continued to extend its leadership in its surgical tissue heart valve product line with the recent introduction of the PERIMOUNT Magna Ease valve and the next generation Carpentier-Edwards Physio II mitral valve repair ring.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P13_S2	Sales of the Company's surgical heart valve products represented approximately 40%, 44% and 46% of the Company's net sales in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	Edwards Lifesciences has leveraged the knowledge and experience from its surgical tissue heart valve portfolio to develop transcatheter heart valve replacement technologies, designed to treat heart valve disease using catheter-based approaches as opposed to open surgical techniques.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P14_S1	For aortic valve replacement, the Company has developed the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve, which is delivered using the RetroFlex 3 delivery system for transfemoral approaches, and the Ascendra delivery system for transapical approaches.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P14_S2	Both are minimal access, beating heart procedures.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	In late 2011, the Edwards SAPIEN valve with the RetroFlex 3 delivery system was approved for use in certain inoperable patients in the United States.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	The Company has also developed the Edwards SAPIEN XT transcatheter heart valve, which is delivered using the lower profile NovaFlex delivery system for transfemoral approaches, and the Ascendra2 delivery system for transapical approaches.

1099800_12_ITEM1_P71_S0	product standards and specifications; packaging requirements; labeling requirements; quality system requirements; import restrictions; tariffs; duties; and tax requirements.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P72_S0	Many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the FDA.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P72_S1	In some regions, the level of government regulation of medical devices is increasing, which can lengthen time to market and increase registration and approval costs.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P73_S0	In many countries, the national health or social security organizations require the Company's products to be qualified before they can be marketed and considered eligible for reimbursement.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P74_S0	Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs, including price regulation and competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements, are continuing in many countries where Edwards Lifesciences does business, including the United States, Europe and Japan.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P74_S1	As a result of these changes, the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical therapies.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P74_S2	For example, government programs, private health care insurance and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for procedures or treatments, and some third-party payors require their pre-approval before new or innovative devices or therapies are utilized by patients.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P74_S3	These various initiatives have created increased price sensitivity over medical products generally and may impact demand for the Company's products and technologies.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P75_S0	The delivery of the Company's products is subject to regulation by the Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") and comparable state and foreign agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P75_S1	Foreign governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P76_S0	Reimbursement schedules regulate the amount the United States government will reimburse hospitals and doctors for the inpatient care of persons covered by Medicare.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P76_S1	CMS may also review whether and/or under what circumstances a procedure or technology is reimbursable.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P77_S0	Several legislative proposals in the United States have been advanced that would restrict future funding increases for government-funded programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P77_S1	Changes in current reimbursement levels could have an adverse effect on market demand and the Company's pricing flexibility.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P78_S0	Hospital reimbursement in the United States for transcatheter aortic valve replacement ("TAVR") procedures is currently aligned with surgical aortic valve replacement codes.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P78_S1	In September 2011, CMS initiated a national coverage analysis for TAVR, which was expected to lead to a national coverage determination ("NCD").
1099800_12_ITEM1_P78_S2	In February 2012, CMS issued a draft NCD, and a final NCD is expected by mid-year 2012.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P78_S3	The Company believes a well-written NCD that ensures adequate patient access would be positive for patients and physicians.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P78_S4	The Company cannot predict the outcome of this process, and a negative determination, such as one that restricts the use of its products, could have an adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P79_S0	Health care cost containment efforts have also prompted domestic hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power, and this trend is expected to continue.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P79_S1	The medical device industry has also experienced some consolidation, partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P79_S2	As a result, transactions with customers are larger, more complex and tend to involve more long-term contracts than in the past.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P79_S3	These larger customers, due to their enhanced purchasing power, may attempt to increase the pressure on product pricing.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P80_S0	In 2010, significant reforms to the healthcare system were adopted as law in the United States.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P80_S1	The law includes provisions that, among other things, reduce or limit Medicare reimbursement, require all individuals to have health insurance (with limited exceptions) and impose increased taxes.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P80_S2	Specifically, the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize healthcare reform in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on United States sales of most medical devices beginning in 2013.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P80_S3	The excise tax will increase the Company's operating expenses.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P81_S0	Because many parts of the 2010 healthcare law remain subject to implementation, the long-term impact on the Company is uncertain.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P81_S1	The new law or any future legislation could reduce medical procedure volumes, lower reimbursement for the Company's products, and impact the demand for the Company's products or the prices at which the Company sells its products.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P82_S0	On October 25, 2010, the Puerto Rican government enacted a new tax law effective for transactions occurring after December 31, 2010.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P82_S1	The law, Act 154, modifies Puerto Rican tax law by imposing a temporary excise tax on intercompany purchases made through 2016 and by adopting a new sourcing rule.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P82_S2	The Company projects that the excise tax impact for 2011 of $6.1 million will be offset by credits available under the implementing excise tax regulations.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P82_S3	The financial impact of the new sourcing rule is not expected to be material.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P83_S0	Edwards Lifesciences' quarterly net sales are influenced by many factors, including new product introductions, acquisitions, regulatory approvals, patient and physician holiday schedules, and other factors.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P83_S1	Net sales in the third quarter are typically lower than other quarters of the year due to the seasonality of the United States and European markets, where summer vacation schedules normally result in fewer procedures.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P84_S0	As of December 31, 2011, Edwards Lifesciences had approximately 7,800 employees worldwide, the majority of whom were located at the Company's headquarters in Irvine, California, and at its manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P84_S1	Other major concentrations of employees are located in Europe, Japan and Singapore.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P85_S0	Edwards Lifesciences emphasizes competitive compensation, benefits, equity participation and work environment practices in its efforts to attract and retain qualified personnel, and employs a rigorous talent management system.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P85_S1	None of Edwards Lifesciences' North American employees are represented by a labor union.
1099800_12_ITEM1_P85_S2	In various countries outside of North America, the Company interacts with trade unions and work councils that represent a limited number of employees.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our business and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	An investor should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P0_S3	If any of these events or circumstances occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially harmed.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P0_S4	In that case, the value of our securities could decline and an investor could lose part or all of his or her investment.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P0_S5	In addition, forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws that are contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in our other filings or statements may be subject to the risks described below as well as other risks and uncertainties.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P0_S6	Please read the cautionary notice regarding forward-looking statements in Item 7 below.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our products may become obsolete and our operating results may suffer.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The cardiovascular products industry is characterized by technological changes, frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Without the timely introduction of new and improved products, our products could become technologically obsolete or more susceptible to competition and our revenue and operating results would suffer.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Even if we are able to develop new or improved products, our ability to market them could be limited by the need for regulatory clearance, restrictions imposed on approved indications, entrenched patterns of clinical practice, uncertainty over third-party reimbursement or other factors.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P2_S3	We devote significant financial and other resources to our research and development activities; however, the research and development process is prolonged and entails considerable uncertainty.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Accordingly, products we are currently developing may not complete the development process or obtain the regulatory or other approvals required to market such products in a timely manner or at all.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Technical innovations often require substantial time and investment before we can determine their commercial viability.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We may not have the financial resources necessary to fund these projects.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P3_S2	In addition, even if we are able to successfully develop new or improved products, they may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development, and they may be rendered obsolete or less competitive by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products with newer technologies or features or other factors.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We may incur product liability losses that could adversely affect our operating results.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P5_S2	In addition, many of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product related risks or product related information could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, patients.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Such a problem could result in product liability lawsuits and claims, safety alerts or product recalls in the future, which, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Product liability claims may be brought from time to time either by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We may incur charges related to such matters in excess of any established reserves and such charges, including the establishment of any such reserves, could have a material adverse impact on our net income and net cash flows.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We may experience supply interruptions that could harm our ability to manufacture products.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We use a broad range of raw and organic materials and other items in the design and manufacture of our products.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our non-implantable products are manufactured from man-made raw materials including resins, chemicals, electronics and metals.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We purchase certain of the materials and components used in the manufacture of our products from external suppliers, and we purchase certain supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance, cost-effectiveness, availability or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P10_S2	General economic conditions could adversely affect the financial viability of our suppliers, resulting in their inability to provide materials and components used in the manufacture of our products.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P10_S3	While we work closely with suppliers to monitor their financial viability and to assure continuity of supply and maintain high quality and reliability, these efforts may not be successful.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P10_S4	In addition, due to the rigorous regulations and requirements of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products (including the need for approval of any change in supply arrangements), we may have difficulty establishing additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or at all if the need arises.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Although alternative supplier options are considered and identified, we typically do not pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships and the time and expense associated with the regulatory validation process.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P10_S6	A change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to product performance or incorporate unique technology, and the loss of any existing supply contract could have a material adverse effect on us.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Regulatory agencies in the United States or other international geographies from time to time have limited or banned the use of certain materials used in the manufacture of our products.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In these circumstances, transition periods typically provide time to arrange for alternative materials.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	If we are unable to identify alternative materials and secure approval for their use in a timely manner, our business could be harmed.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Some of our suppliers are located outside the United States.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	As a result, trade or regulatory embargoes imposed by foreign countries or the United States could result in delays or shortages that could harm our business.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	If we or one of our suppliers encounters manufacturing or quality problems, our business could suffer.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls, due in part to rigorous regulatory requirements.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In addition, quality is extremely important due to the serious and costly consequences of a product failure.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Problems can arise during the manufacturing process for a number of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow protocols and procedures, raw material problems or human error.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P15_S3	If these problems arise or if we otherwise fail to meet our internal quality standards or those of the FDA or other applicable regulatory body, which include detailed record-keeping requirements, our reputation could be damaged, we could become subject to a safety alert or a recall, we could incur product liability and other costs, product approvals could be delayed and our business could otherwise be adversely affected.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We may be required, from time to time, to recognize charges in connection with the write-down of our investments, asset or business dispositions, the termination of interest rate swap agreements, or for other reasons.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We have equity investments in other companies, and we may make similar investments in the future.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	To the extent that the value of any of these investments declines, we may be required to recognize charges to write down the value of that investment.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	At December 31, 2011, we had $21.8 million of investments in equity instruments of other companies and had recorded unrealized gains of $1.1 million on these investments on our consolidated balance sheet in " Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss ," net of tax.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	In addition, from time to time we identify businesses and products that are not performing at a level commensurate with the rest of our business.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We may seek to dispose of these underperforming businesses or products.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We may also seek to dispose of other businesses or products for strategic or other business reasons.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	If we cannot dispose of a business or product on acceptable terms, we may voluntarily cease operations related to that business or product.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Any of these events could result in charges, which could be substantial and which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Historically, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements and may do so from time to time in the future.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P21_S1	In the event that we elect to terminate a swap agreement prior to its maturity, we could be required to make cash payments to the counterparty and to recognize a charge in connection with that termination, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We may not successfully identify and complete acquisitions or strategic alliances on favorable terms or achieve anticipated synergies relating to any acquisitions or alliances, and such acquisitions could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, require significant management resources and require significant charges or write-downs.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We regularly explore potential acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, as well as potential strategic alliances.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	We may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates or appropriate partners with which to form alliances.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Even if we identify appropriate acquisition or alliance candidates, we may be unable to complete the acquisitions or alliances on favorable terms, if at all.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P23_S3	In addition, the process of integrating an acquired business, technology, service or product into our existing operations could result in unforeseen difficulties and expenditures.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Integration of an acquired company often requires significant expenditures as well as significant management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our other businesses.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Moreover, we may not realize the anticipated financial or other benefits of an acquisition or alliance.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We may be required to take charges or write-downs in connection with acquisitions.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P24_S1	In particular, acquisitions of businesses engaged in the development of new products may give rise to in-process research and development assets.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P24_S2	To the extent that the value of these assets declines, we may be required to write down the value of the assets.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Also, in connection with certain asset acquisitions, we may be required to take an immediate charge related to acquired in-process research and development.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Either of these situations could result in substantial charges, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Future acquisitions could also involve the issuance of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization of expenses related to other intangible assets, any of which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P25_S1	In addition, equity or debt financing required for such acquisitions may not be available.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	General economic and political conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	External factors can affect our profitability and financial condition.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Such external factors include general domestic and global economic conditions, such as interest rates, tax rates and factors affecting global economic stability, and the political environment regarding healthcare in general.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P27_S2	While the economic environment has shown some signs of improvement, the strength and timing of any economic recovery remains uncertain, and we cannot predict to what extent the global economic slowdown may negatively impact our business.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P27_S3	For example, an increase in interest rates could result in an increase in our borrowing costs and could otherwise restrict our ability to access the capital markets.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P27_S4	Negative conditions in the credit and capital markets could impair our ability to access the financial markets for working capital or other funds, and could negatively impact our ability to borrow.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P27_S5	Such conditions could result in decreased liquidity and impairments in the carrying value of our investments, and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P27_S6	These and other conditions could also adversely affect our customers, and may impact their ability or decision to purchase our products or make payments on a timely basis.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	In 2010, significant reforms to the healthcare system were adopted as law in the United States.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The law includes provisions that, among other things, reduce or limit Medicare reimbursement, require all individuals to have health insurance (with limited exceptions) and impose increased taxes.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	the medical device industry to subsidize healthcare reform in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on United States sales of most medical devices beginning in 2013.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The excise tax will increase our operating expenses.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Because many parts of the 2010 healthcare law remain subject to implementation, the long-term impact on us is uncertain.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P30_S1	The new law or any future legislation could reduce medical procedure volumes, lower reimbursement for the Company's products, and impact the demand for the Company's products or the prices at which the Company sells its products.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	The Budget Control Act of 2011, which provided an increase to the United States debt limit, imposed significant cuts in federal spending over the next decade.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Subsequently, as a result of the inability of a bipartisan Congressional committee to agree on further deficit reduction, certain additional mandatory spending cuts will take effect in the future unless Congress and the President agree otherwise.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P31_S2	In addition, alternative deficit reduction proposals could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and prospects if they were to include cuts to, or a restructuring of, entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid programs.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We do business with foreign governments outside the United States.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P32_S1	A number of these countries, including certain European countries, have experienced a deterioration in credit and economic conditions.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P32_S2	These conditions have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a reduction in the number of procedures that use our products and an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect accounts receivable outstanding in these countries.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P32_S3	In addition, we have been and may continue to be impacted by declines in sovereign credit ratings or sovereign defaults in these countries.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our business is subject to economic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations, including risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Because we sell our products in a number of countries, our business is subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including risks associated with United States government oversight and enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as well as with the United Kingdom's Bribery Act and anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Our net sales originating outside of the United States, as a percentage of total net sales, were 64% in 2011.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P34_S2	We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P34_S3	In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the United States.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	changes in local medical reimbursement policies and programs; changes in foreign regulatory requirements; changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions, such as the current financial uncertainties in Europe and changing circumstances in emerging regions; trade protection measures, quotas, embargoes, import or export licensing requirements and duties, tariffs or surcharges; potentially negative impact of tax laws, including tax costs associated with the repatriation of cash; difficulty in staffing and managing global operations; cultural, exchange rate or other local factors affecting financial terms with customers; local economic and financial conditions affecting the collectability of receivables, including receivables from sovereign entities; an outbreak of any life threatening communicable disease; economic and political instability and local economic and political conditions; differing labor regulations; and differing protection of intellectual property.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Substantially all of our sales outside of the United States are denominated in local currencies.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Measured in local currency, a substantial portion of our international sales was generated in Europe (and primarily denominated in the Euro) and in Japan.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P36_S2	The United States dollar value of our international sales varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Decreases in the value of the United States dollar to the Euro or the Japanese yen have the effect of increasing our reported revenues even when the volume of international sales has remained constant.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Increases in the value of the United States dollar relative to the Euro or the Japanese yen, as well as other currencies, have the opposite effect and, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our reported revenues and results of operations.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P36_S5	We have a hedging program for certain currencies that attempts to manage currency exchange rate risks to an acceptable level based on management's judgment of the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity and cost; however, this hedging program does not completely eliminate the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act, and similar laws in other jurisdictions contain prohibitions against bribery and other illegal payments or for the failure to have procedures in place that prevent such payments.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Recent years have seen an increasing number of investigations and other enforcement activities under these laws.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Although we have compliance programs in place with respect to these laws, no assurance can be given that a violation will not be found, and if found, the resulting penalties could adversely affect us and our business.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The stock market can be volatile and fluctuations in our quarterly operating results as well as other factors could cause our stock price to decline.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	From time to time the stock market experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P39_S1	This volatility can have a significant effect on the market prices of securities for reasons unrelated to underlying performance.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P39_S2	These broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect our stock price, regardless of our operating results.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P39_S3	In addition, the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in response to any of the other risk factors set out above and below, as well as a number of other factors, including the performance of comparable companies or the medical device industry.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P40_S1	A high proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to significant sales, research and development, and manufacturing costs.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Thus, small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter, and the price of our common stock could fall.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Other factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include:
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	increased expenses, whether related to sales and marketing, raw materials or supplies, product development or administration; changes in the level of economic activity in the United States or other regions in which we do business; costs related to acquisitions of technologies or businesses; and our ability to expand our operations and the amount and timing of expansion-related expenditures.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We face intense competition, and if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The cardiovascular medical device industry is highly competitive.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We compete with many companies, some of which have longer operating histories, better brand or name recognition, broader product lines and greater access to financial and other resources.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Our customers consider many factors when selecting a product, including product reliability, breadth of product line, clinical outcomes, product availability, price, availability and rate of reimbursement, and services provided by the manufacturer.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P43_S3	In addition, our ability to compete will depend in large part on our ability to develop and acquire new products and technologies, anticipate technology advances and keep pace with other developers of cardiovascular therapies and technologies.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P43_S4	Our competitive position can also be adversely affected by product problems, physician advisories and safety alerts, reflecting the importance of quality in the medical device industry.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P43_S5	Market share can shift as a result of any of these factors.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P43_S6	See " Competition " under " Business " included herein.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Consolidation in the healthcare industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The healthcare industry has been consolidating and organizations such as GPOs, independent delivery networks, and large single accounts such as the United States Veterans Administration, continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for many of our healthcare provider customers.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P45_S1	As a result, transactions with customers are larger, more complex, and tend to involve more long-term contracts.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P45_S2	The purchasing power of these larger customers has increased, and may continue to increase, causing downward pressure on product pricing.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P45_S3	If we are not one of the providers selected by one of these organizations, we may be precluded from making sales to its members or participants.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P45_S4	Even if we are one of the selected providers, we may be at a disadvantage relative to other selected providers that are able to offer volume discounts based on purchases of a broader range of medical equipment and supplies.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P45_S5	Further, we may be required to commit to pricing that has a material adverse effect on our revenues and profit margins, business, financial condition and results of operations.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P45_S6	We expect that market demand, governmental regulation, third-party reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances, which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Our success and competitive position are dependent in part upon our proprietary intellectual property.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P47_S1	We rely on a combination of patents and trade secrets to protect our proprietary intellectual property, and we expect to continue to do so.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Although we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of means, we cannot guarantee that the protective steps we have taken are adequate to protect these rights.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged and held invalid.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P48_S1	In addition, as our patents expire, we may be unsuccessful in extending their protection through patent term extensions.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P48_S2	The expiration of, or the failure to maintain or extend our patents, could have a material adverse effect on us.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We also rely on confidentiality agreements with certain employees, consultants and other third parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary information.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P49_S1	These agreements could be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for such a breach.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P49_S2	In addition, others could independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary information.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We spend significant resources to enforce our intellectual property rights, sometimes resulting in litigation.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Intellectual property litigation is complex and can be expensive and time-consuming.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P50_S2	However, our efforts in this regard may not be successful.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P50_S3	We may not be able to detect infringement.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P50_S4	In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Patent litigation can result in substantial cost and diversion of effort.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Intellectual property protection may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, enabling our competitors to capture increased market position.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P51_S2	The invalidation of key intellectual property rights or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits filed to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or prospects.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P53_S0	During recent years, we and our competitors have been involved in substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P53_S1	From time to time, we have been and may in the future be forced to defend against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, and such intellectual property litigation is typically costly and time-consuming.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Adverse determinations in any such litigation could result in significant liabilities to third parties or injunctions, or could require us to seek licenses from third parties and, if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms, prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using certain products, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on us.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P53_S3	In addition, some licenses may be non-exclusive, which could provide our competitors access to the same technologies.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Third parties could also obtain patents that may require us to either redesign products or, if possible, negotiate licenses from such third parties.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Such licenses may materially increase our expenses.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P54_S2	If we are unable to redesign products or obtain a license, we might have to exit a particular product offering.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We and our customers are subject to rigorous governmental regulations and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products that are compatible with these regulations.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P55_S1	In addition, failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial sanctions which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P56_S0	The medical devices we manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities, including regulations that cover the composition, labeling, testing, clinical study, design, manufacturing, packaging, marketing, advertising, promotion and distribution of our products.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We are required to register with the FDA as a device manufacturer.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P57_S1	As a result, we are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA's Quality System Regulation ("QSR") requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, design, quality control and documentation procedures.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P57_S2	The FDA may also inspect our compliance with requirements related to adverse event reporting, recalls or corrections (field actions), the conduct of clinical studies, and other requirements.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P58_S0	In the European Union, we are required to maintain certain CE Mark and ISO certifications in order to sell our products, and are subject to periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P58_S1	If we or our suppliers fail to adhere to QSR, CE Mark, ISO or similar requirements, this could delay or interrupt product production or sales and/or lead to fines, difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances, recalls or other consequences, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or prospects.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Medical devices must receive FDA clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the United States.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P59_S1	In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of approved products that have been commercialized, and can prevent or limit further marketing of a product based upon the results of post-marketing programs.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P60_S0	that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Federal regulations also require us to report certain recalls or corrective actions to the FDA.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Furthermore, most major markets for medical devices outside the United States require clearance, approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P60_S3	The process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device, particularly from the FDA and certain foreign governmental authorities, can be costly and time-consuming, and clearances or approvals may not be granted for products or product improvements on a timely basis, if at all.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P60_S4	Delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, clearances or approvals for products or product improvements could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations or prospects.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P61_S0	At any time after approval of a product for commercial sale, the FDA may conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with QSR requirements, and/or current Medical Device Reporting regulations, or other regulatory requirements.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Noncompliance with applicable requirements may subject the Company or responsible individuals to sanctions including civil money penalties, product seizure, injunction, or criminal prosecution.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Additionally, product approvals by the FDA can be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We are also subject to various United States and international laws pertaining to healthcare pricing and fraud and abuse, including prohibitions on kickbacks and the submission of false claims laws and restrictions on relationships with physicians and other referral sources.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P62_S1	These laws are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation, which could require us to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if we are found not to be in compliance.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P62_S2	Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions against the Company and our officers and employees, including substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Despite our implementation of robust compliance processes, we may be subject, from time to time, to inspections, investigations and other enforcement actions by governmental authorities.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P63_S1	If we are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, the applicable governmental authority can impose fines, delay, suspend, or revoke regulatory clearances or approvals, institute proceedings to detain or seize our products, issue a recall, impose marketing or operating restrictions, enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against us or our officers or employees, and institute criminal prosecution.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Moreover, governmental authorities can ban or request the recall, repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any device or product we manufacture or distribute.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P63_S3	Any of the foregoing actions could result in decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P63_S4	In addition to the sanctions for noncompliance described above, commencement of an enforcement proceeding, inspection or investigation could divert substantial management attention from the operation of our business and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Our industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities, which may lead to greater governmental regulation in the future.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P65_S0	In recent years, the medical device industry has been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny, including by the FDA, numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities, as well as members of Congress.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P65_S1	This has included increased regulation, enforcement, inspections, and governmental investigations of the medical device industry and disclosure of financial relationships with health care professionals.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P65_S2	We anticipate that the government will continue to scrutinize our industry closely, and that additional regulation by governmental authorities, both foreign and domestic, may increase compliance costs, exposure to litigation and other adverse effects to our operations.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Unsuccessful clinical trials or developmental procedures relating to products under development could have a material adverse effect on our prospects.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P67_S0	The regulatory approval process for new products and new indications for existing products requires extensive clinical trials and procedures.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from current or future clinical trials conducted by us, our competitors, or third parties, or perceptions regarding this clinical data, could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary approvals and the market's view of our future prospects.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P67_S2	Such clinical trials are inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that these trials or procedures will be completed in a timely or cost-effective manner or result in a commercially viable product.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P67_S3	Failure to successfully complete these trials or procedures in a timely and cost-effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our prospects.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Clinical trials may experience significant setbacks even after earlier trials have shown promising results.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Further, preliminary results from clinical trials may be contradicted by subsequent clinical analysis.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P68_S2	In addition, results from our clinical trials or procedures may not be supported by actual long-term studies or clinical experience.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P68_S3	If preliminary clinical results are later contradicted, or if initial results cannot be supported by actual long-term studies or clinical experience, our business could be adversely affected.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P68_S4	Clinical trials may be suspended or terminated by us, the FDA or other regulatory authorities at any time if it is believed that the trial participants face unacceptable health risks.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Certain of our products, including pericardial tissue valves, are manufactured using bovine tissue.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Concerns relating to the potential transmission of BSE, commonly known as "mad cow disease," from cows to humans may result in reduced acceptance of products containing bovine materials.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P70_S1	Certain medical device regulatory agencies have considered whether to continue to permit the sale of medical devices that incorporate bovine material.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P71_S0	We obtain bovine tissue only from closely controlled sources within the United States and Australia.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P71_S1	The bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valves is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility for the suspected BSE infectious agent.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P71_S2	We have not experienced any significant adverse impact on our sales as a result of concerns regarding BSE, but no assurance can be given that such an impact may not occur in the future.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P72_S0	If third-party payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or impose other cost containment measures to reduce reimbursement levels, our ability to profitably sell our products will be harmed.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P73_S0	We sell our products and technologies to hospitals, doctors and other health care providers, all of which receive reimbursement for the health care services provided to patients from third-party payors, such as government programs (both domestic and international), private insurance plans and managed care programs.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P73_S1	The ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products from private and governmental third-party payors is critical to the success of medical technology companies.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P73_S2	The availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P73_S3	Reimbursement varies from country to country and can significantly impact acceptance of new products.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Hospital reimbursement in the United States for TAVR procedures is currently aligned with surgical aortic valve replacement codes.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P75_S0	In September 2011, CMS initiated a national coverage analysis for TAVR, which was expected to lead to a NCD.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P75_S1	In February 2012, CMS issued a draft NCD, and a final NCD is expected by mid-year 2012.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We believe a well-written NCD that ensures adequate patient access would be positive for patients and physicians.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P76_S1	We cannot predict the outcome of this process, and a negative determination, such as one that restricts the use of our products, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P78_S0	The introduction of cost containment incentives, combined with closer scrutiny of health care expenditures by both private health insurers and employers, has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P78_S1	Hospitals or physicians may respond to such cost-containment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other therapies.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P78_S2	In addition, the 2010 United States healthcare law could adversely affect reimbursement levels for our products, or otherwise adversely affect our product pricing and profitability.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs, including price regulation, are underway in several countries around the world.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P79_S1	In many countries, customers are reimbursed for our products under a government operated insurance system.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P79_S2	Under such a system, the government periodically reviews reimbursement levels and may limit patient access.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P79_S3	If a government were to decide to reduce reimbursement levels, our product pricing could be adversely affected.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods as determined by such third-party payors, or was used for an unapproved indication.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P80_S1	Third-party payors may also deny reimbursement for experimental procedures and devices.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P81_S0	We believe that many of our existing products are cost-effective, even though the one-time cost may be significant, because they are intended to reduce overall health care costs over a long period of time.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P81_S1	We cannot be certain that these third-party payors will recognize these cost savings instead of merely focusing on the lower initial costs associated with competing therapies.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P81_S2	If our products are not considered cost-effective by third-party payors, our customers may not be reimbursed for them, resulting in lower sales of our products.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Use of our products in unapproved circumstances could expose us to liabilities.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P83_S0	The marketing approval from the FDA and other regulators of certain of our products are, or are expected to be, limited to specific indications.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P83_S1	We are prohibited by law from marketing or promoting any unapproved use of our products.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P83_S2	Physicians, however, can use these products in ways or circumstances other than those strictly within the scope of the regulatory approval.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P83_S3	Although the product training we provide to physicians and other healthcare professionals is limited to approved uses, no assurance can be given that claims might not be asserted against us if our products are used in ways or for procedures that are not approved.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Our operations are subject to environmental, health and safety regulations that could result in substantial costs.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Our operations are subject to environmental, health and safety laws, and regulations concerning, among other things, the generation, handling, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes, the cleanup of hazardous substance releases, and emissions or discharges into the air or water.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P85_S1	We have incurred and may incur expenditures in the future in connection with environmental, health and safety laws, and regulations.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P85_S2	New laws and regulations, violations of these laws or regulations, stricter enforcement of existing requirements, or the discovery of previously unknown contamination could require us to incur costs or could become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could be material.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P86_S0	The success of many of our products depends upon strong relationships with certain key physicians.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P87_S0	The development, marketing and sale of many of our products requires us to maintain working relationships with physicians upon whom we rely to provide considerable knowledge and experience.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P87_S1	These physicians may assist us as researchers, marketing consultants, product trainers and consultants, inventors and as public speakers.
1099800_12_ITEM1A_P87_S2	If new laws, regulations or other developments limit our ability to maintain strong relationships with these professionals or to continue to receive their advice and input, the development and marketing of our products could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1099800_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	The locations and uses of the major properties of Edwards Lifesciences are as follows:
1099800_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	The Irvine, California lease expires in 2021; the Draper, Utah lease expires in 2025; the Dominican Republic property has one lease that expires in 2012 and one that expires in 2019; the Puerto Rico property has one lease that expires in 2018 and one that expires in 2016; the Horw, Switzerland lease expires in 2013; the Tokyo, Japan lease expires in 2012; and the Changi, Singapore landlease expires in 2036.
1099800_12_ITEM2_P2_S0	The Company's properties have been well maintained, are in good operating condition and are adequate for current needs.
1099800_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	In February 2008, Edwards Lifesciences filed a lawsuit against CoreValve, Inc. ("CoreValve") in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that its ReValving System infringes three of the Company's U.S. Andersen patents, later narrowed to one patent ("the '552 patent").
1099800_12_ITEM3_P0_S1	CoreValve was acquired by Medtronic, Inc. ("Medtronic") in April 2009.
1099800_12_ITEM3_P1_S0	In April 2010, a federal jury found that patent to be valid and found that CoreValve willfully infringes it.
1099800_12_ITEM3_P1_S1	The jury also awarded Edwards $73.9 million in damages.
1099800_12_ITEM3_P1_S2	In February 2011, the District Court reaffirmed the jury decision and ruled that Edwards is entitled to recover additional damages due to CoreValve's continued infringing sales from the trial through the life of the patent, plus interest.
1099800_12_ITEM3_P1_S3	In the same ruling, the court denied Edwards' motions for a permanent injunction, as well as its motion for increased damages relating to CoreValve's willful infringement.
1099800_12_ITEM3_P1_S4	Both Edwards and CoreValve have appealed.
1099800_12_ITEM3_P1_S5	A second lawsuit is pending in the same court against CoreValve and Medtronic alleging infringement of three U.S. Andersen patents.
1099800_12_ITEM3_P1_S6	In September 2010, the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO") granted Medtronic's third request to reexamine the validity of the claim of the '552 patent and in July 2011 confirmed the validity of that patent.
1099800_12_ITEM3_P2_S0	In June 2011, Medtronic filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota alleging that certain surgical valve holders and a surgical embolic filter device infringe its patents.
1099800_12_ITEM3_P2_S1	Edwards counterclaimed against Medtronic, alleging that the Medtronic Contour 3D annuloplasty ring infringes an Edwards ring patent.
1099800_12_ITEM3_P2_S2	By the Order of a Magistrate Judge in January 2012, the lawsuit has been stayed pending the outcome of future reexamination findings by the USPTO.

1099800_12_ITEM3_P6_S1	Such cases and claims raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the facts and circumstances of each particular case or claim, the jurisdiction in which each suit is brought, and differences in applicable law.
1099800_12_ITEM3_P6_S2	Upon resolution of any such legal matter or other claim, Edwards Lifesciences may incur charges in excess of established reserves.
1099800_12_ITEM3_P6_S3	The Company is not able to estimate the amount or range of any loss for legal contingencies for which there is no reserve or additional loss for matters already reserved.
1099800_12_ITEM3_P6_S4	While any such charge could have a material adverse impact on Edwards Lifesciences' net income or cash flows in the period in which it is recorded or paid, management does not believe that any such charge relating to any currently pending lawsuit would have a material adverse effect on Edwards Lifesciences' financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

1099800_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	Driven by a passion to help patients, the Company partners with clinicians to develop innovative technologies in the areas of structural heart disease and critical care monitoring that enable them to save and enhance lives.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	The products and technologies provided by Edwards Lifesciences are categorized into four main areas: Heart Valve Therapy; Critical Care; Cardiac Surgery Systems; and Vascular.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	Edwards Lifesciences' Heart Valve Therapy portfolio is comprised of tissue heart valves and heart valve repair products.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	A pioneer in the development and commercialization of heart valve products, Edwards Lifesciences is the world's leading manufacturer of tissue heart valves and repair products used to replace or repair a patient's diseased or defective heart valve.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	leader in hemodynamic monitoring systems used to measure a patient's cardiovascular function.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	Prior to September 2009, Edwards Lifesciences provided products for continuous renal replacement therapy ("hemofiltration product line").
1099800_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	The Company sold the hemofiltration product line in September 2009.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	The Company's Cardiac Surgery Systems portfolio comprises a diverse line of products for use during cardiac surgery including cannulae, embolic protection devices and other products used during cardiopulmonary bypass and minimally invasive surgical procedures.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	Edwards Lifesciences' Vascular portfolio includes a line of balloon catheter-based products, surgical clips and inserts.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P7_S2	Edwards Lifesciences manufactured and sold LifeStent balloon-expandable and self-expanding non-coronary stents until the sale of this product line in January 2008.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P7_S3	The Company continued to manufacture these products for the buyer until September 2009 when manufacturing was transferred to the buyer.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	The healthcare marketplace continues to be competitive with strong global and local competitors.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	The Company competes with many companies, ranging from small start-up enterprises to companies that are larger and more established than Edwards Lifesciences with access to significant financial resources.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P8_S2	Furthermore, rapid product development and technological change characterize the market in which the Company competes.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	Global demand for healthcare is increasing as the population ages.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	There is mounting pressure to contain healthcare costs in the face of this increasing demand, which has resulted in pricing and market share pressures.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P9_S2	The cardiovascular segment of the medical device industry is dynamic, and technology, cost-of-care considerations, regulatory reform, industry and customer consolidation, and evolving patient needs are expected to continue to drive change.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	In 2010, significant reforms to the healthcare system were adopted as law in the United States.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	The law includes provisions that, among other things, reduce or limit Medicare reimbursement, require all individuals to have health insurance (with limited exceptions) and impose increased taxes.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P10_S2	Specifically, the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize healthcare reform in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on United States sales of most medical devices beginning in 2013.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P10_S3	The excise tax will increase the Company's operating expenses.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	Because many parts of the 2010 healthcare law remain subject to implementation, the long-term impact on the Company is uncertain.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	The new law or any future legislation could reduce medical procedure volumes, lower reimbursement for the Company's products, and impact the demand for the Company's products or the prices at which the Company sells its products.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	The $38.0 million increase in net sales in the United States in 2011 was due primarily to:
1099800_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	Critical Care products, which increased net sales by $11.2 million, driven primarily by the FloTrac minimally invasive monitoring system and pressure monitoring products.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	The $193.6 million increase in international net sales in 2011 was due primarily to:

1099800_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	The $11.5 million increase in net sales in the United States in 2010 was due primarily to:
1099800_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	the discontinuance of manufacturing in September 2009 of the divested LifeStent product line, which decreased net sales by $8.2 million.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	The $114.1 million increase in international net sales in 2010 was due primarily to:
1099800_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	hemofiltration products, which decreased net sales by $32.0 million.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	The Company sold its hemofiltration product line in September 2009.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net sales is not necessarily indicative of the impact on net income due to the corresponding effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on international manufacturing and operating costs and the Company's hedging activities.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	The $172.4 million increase in net sales of Heart Valve Therapy products in 2011 was due primarily to:
1099800_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	surgical heart valves, which increased net sales by $21.1 million, primarily as a result of the Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna Aortic Ease and Magna Mitral Ease valves; and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which increased net sales by $33.6 million due primarily to the strengthening of the Euro and the Japanese yen against the United States dollar.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	The $123.4 million increase in net sales of Heart Valve Therapy products in 2010 was due primarily to:

1099800_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	The Company sold its hemofiltration product line in September 2009.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	The $7.3 million increase in net sales of Cardiac Surgery Systems products in 2011 was due primarily to specialty cannula products, which increased net sales by $3.1 million, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which increased net sales by $2.8 million due primarily to the strengthening of the Euro and the Japanese yen against the United States dollar.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	The $7.4 million increase in net sales of Cardiac Surgery Systems products in 2010 was due primarily to MIS products, which increased net sales by $3.7 million, and specialty cannula products, which increased net sales by $3.1 million.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company obtained CE Mark and 510(k) clearance for its IntraClude aortic occlusion device.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	IntraClude is the first of several new products that the Company expects to introduce in its MIS portfolio.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	The $2.3 million decrease in net sales of Vascular products in 2011 was due primarily to the Company's discontinued distribution of artificial implantable grafts during the first quarter of 2011.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	The $6.8 million decrease in net sales of Vascular products in 2010 was due primarily to the discontinuance of manufacturing in September 2009 of the divested LifeStent product line.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	The 1.0 percentage point decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2011 was driven by:
1099800_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	a 0.5 percentage point increase in international markets due to a more profitable international product mix, primarily higher sales of transcatheter heart valves; and a 0.3 percentage point increase in the United States due to a more profitable product mix, primarily higher sales of Heart Valve Therapy products, including transcatheter heart valves, and Critical Care products.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	The 2.0 percentage point increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2010 was driven by:
1099800_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	a 1.5 percentage point increase due to a more profitable international product mix, primarily higher sales of transcatheter heart valves and the divestiture of the hemofiltration product line, and the favorable impact of manufacturing performance; and a 0.5 percentage point increase primarily due to the favorable impact of manufacturing performance in the United States.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	The $92.4 million increase in SG A expenses in 2011 was due primarily to higher sales and marketing expenses in the United States and Europe, mainly to support the transcatheter heart valve program, including the launch in the United States.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	A expenses by $21.3 million due to the strengthening of various currencies against the United States dollar, primarily the Euro and the Japanese yen.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	The $41.2 million increase in SG A expenses in 2010 was primarily in Europe due to (1) higher sales and marketing expenses, primarily to support the transcatheter heart valve program, and (2) higher sales-related spending in the Critical Care and Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product lines.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	Foreign currency had an unfavorable impact of $2.7 million, primarily due to the strengthening of various currencies against the United States dollar, primarily the Japanese yen, partially offset by the weakening of the Euro against the United States dollar.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	The increase in research and development expenses in 2011 was due primarily to additional investments in clinical studies and new product development efforts in the transcatheter heart valve program.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	The increase in research and development expenses in 2010 was due to additional investments in all major product lines, primarily the transcatheter heart valve program.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	The following are the developments related to the Company's transcatheter heart valve program:
1099800_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	the Company received conditional IDE approval from the FDA in March 2007 to initiate The PARTNER Trial, a pivotal clinical trial of the Company's Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve technology.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P45_S1	The PARTNER Trial, which has two study arms, evaluated the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve in patients who are considered at high risk for conventional open-heart valve surgery.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	In the first study arm ("Cohort A"), patients were randomized on a 1:1 basis to either high risk surgery or the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	In the second study arm ("Cohort B"), patients who were deemed non-operable were randomized 1:1 to medical management or the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P46_S2	In addition, the Company received FDA approval for non-randomized continued access for all of its existing PARTNER sites.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P46_S3	During 2010, positive one-year data from Cohort B was published and the Company completed the submission of its pre-market approval application ("PMA") to the FDA.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P46_S4	In November 2011, the Company received approval from the FDA for the transfemoral delivery of the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve for treatment of certain inoperable patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis.

1099800_12_ITEM7_P46_S6	The PARTNER II trial will evaluate the Edwards SAPIEN XT with both the NovaFlex and Ascendra2 delivery systems.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	In February 2011, the Company received conditional IDE approval from the FDA for the first pivotal cohort of the PARTNER II trial ("PARTNER II Cohort B").
1099800_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	PARTNER II Cohort B is a study of up to 600 inoperable patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis using a 1:1 randomization of the Edwards SAPIEN XT with the NovaFlex transfemoral delivery system versus the Edwards SAPIEN with the RetroFlex 3 delivery system.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P47_S2	In January 2012, the Company completed enrollment in this cohort of inoperable patients.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P47_S3	In November 2011, the Company received conditional IDE approval from the FDA for the second planned cohort ("PARTNER II Cohort A").
1099800_12_ITEM7_P47_S4	PARTNER II Cohort A is a non-inferiority study of up to 2,000 patients with severe, symptomatic aortic valve stenosis who have an elevated risk for traditional open-heart surgery.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P47_S5	Patients will be evenly randomized to receive the Edwards SAPIEN XT valve or surgery.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P47_S6	Those undergoing transcatheter valve replacement will be treated either transfemorally or transapically; in Japan, the Company began enrolling patients in a clinical trial with its SAPIEN XT valve, called PREVAIL JAPAN, during 2010.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P47_S7	The PREVAIL JAPAN clinical trial will evaluate SAPIEN XT with both the transfemoral and transapical delivery systems.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P47_S8	The Company believes that successful trial completion could result in an approval as early as 2013; and in Europe, the Company expects to commence clinical trials in 2012 for SAPIEN 3 , its next generation balloon-expandable valve that includes a unique feature to further reduce parvalvular leak, and CENTERA , its repositionable, self-expanding valve featuring a motorized delivery system designed for stable deployment and single operator use.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	During 2011, the Company recorded a $12.8 million charge to reflect the increased risk associated with its southern European receivables, primarily Greece.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	In December 2011, the Company recorded a $5.5 million charge related primarily to severance expenses associated with a global workforce realignment impacting 49 employees.

1099800_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	During the second quarter of 2010, the Company decided to discontinue its MONARC transcatheter mitral valve program due to slow enrollment in the EVOLUTION II trial.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P53_S1	As a result, the Company recorded an $8.3 million charge consisting of a $7.6 million impairment of intangible assets associated with the program and $0.7 million of clinical trial costs that will continue to be incurred under a contractual obligation that existed prior to the discontinuation date.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	During 2010, the Company recorded a $7.2 million charge related to the other-than-temporary impairment of certain of its investments in unconsolidated affiliates.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	The Company concluded that the impairment of these investments was other-than-temporary based upon the continuing duration and severity of the impairment.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	In September 2009, the Company recorded a $1.6 million charge related to the other-than-temporary impairment of its investment in an unconsolidated affiliate.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	The Company concluded that the impairment of its investment was other-than-temporary based upon (a) the continuing duration and severity of the impairment and (b) positive clinical trial developments in the third quarter of 2009 which failed to raise the quoted market price of the affiliate's stock to the Company's carrying value.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	In September 2009, the Company sold its hemofiltration product line.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P56_S1	Under the terms of the agreement, the Company received a cash payment of $55.9 million, and was entitled to earn-out payments up to $9.0 million based on certain revenue objectives to be achieved by the buyer over the two years following the sale.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P56_S2	As of March 31, 2011, all earn-out payments had been earned.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P56_S3	The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $43.6 million consisting of the cash proceeds of $55.9 million, offset by $8.5 million related to the net book value of inventory, fixed assets and intangible assets that were sold, satisfaction of a $0.6 million receivable, a $0.5 million write-off of goodwill associated with this product line and $2.7 million of transaction and other costs related to the sale.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P56_S4	In connection with this transaction, the Company also recorded a $1.5 million charge in June 2009 for transaction costs and employee severance.

1099800_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	The Company strives to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P73_S1	While the Company has accrued for matters it believes are more likely than not to require settlement, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P73_S2	Furthermore, the Company may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise its right to appeal.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P73_S3	The uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation, regulations or case law.

1099800_12_ITEM7_P76_S0	As a result of on-going negotiations of an Advanced Pricing Agreement between Switzerland and the United States, the expiration of statutes of limitations, and the possible settlement of on-going audits in several jurisdictions for multiple years throughout the world, the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P76_S1	The range of such change could vary, but the amount of such change is not expected to be material.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P77_S0	In February 2009, California enacted tax legislation which was effective beginning 2011.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P77_S1	The impact of the new legislation has been considered in determining the Company's tax provision for 2011, including the realizability of its California research and development credit carryforward.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P78_S0	The Company has received tax incentives in Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Singapore and Switzerland.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P78_S1	The tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rates favorably impacted earnings per diluted share for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 by $0.40, $0.34 and $0.31, respectively.

1099800_12_ITEM7_P80_S0	The Company's sources of cash liquidity include cash on hand and cash equivalents, short-term investments (bank time deposits with original maturities over three months but less than one year), amounts available under credit facilities and cash from operations.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P80_S1	The Company believes that these sources are sufficient to fund the current requirements of working capital, capital expenditures and other financial commitments.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P80_S2	The Company further believes that it has the financial flexibility to attract long-term capital to fund short-term and long-term growth objectives.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P80_S3	However, no assurances can be given that such long-term capital will be available to the Company on favorable terms, or at all.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P81_S0	As of December 31, 2011, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside the United States were approximately $409.2 million, and have historically been used to fund international operations.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P81_S1	The Company believes that cash held in the United States, in addition to amounts available under credit facilities and cash from operations, are sufficient to fund its United States operating requirements.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P81_S2	The majority of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside the United States relate to undistributed earnings of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries which are considered to be indefinitely reinvested by the Company.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P81_S3	Repatriations of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside the United States are subject to restrictions in certain jurisdictions and may be subject to withholding and other taxes.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P81_S4	The potential tax liability related to any repatriation would be dependent on the facts and circumstances that would exist at the time such repatriation is made and the complexities of the tax laws of the United States and the respective foreign jurisdictions.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P82_S0	In July 2011, Edwards Lifesciences entered into a Four-Year Credit Agreement ("the Credit Facility") which matures on July 29, 2015.

1099800_12_ITEM7_P82_S3	Borrowings generally bear interest at the London interbank offering rate ("LIBOR") plus 0.875%, subject to adjustment for leverage ratio changes as defined in the Credit Facility.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P82_S4	The Company also pays a facility fee of 0.125% on the entire $500.0 million facility whether or not drawn.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P82_S5	The facility fee is also subject to adjustment for leverage ratio changes.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P83_S0	As of December 31, 2011, borrowings of $150.4 million were outstanding under the Credit Facility and have been classified as long-term obligations as these borrowings are expected to be refinanced pursuant to the Credit Facility.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P83_S1	The Credit Facility is unsecured and contains various financial and other covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Facility.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P83_S2	As of December 31, 2011, the Company was in violation of certain covenants as a result of the Company's restatement of its 2011 interim consolidated condensed financial statements.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P83_S3	See Note 20 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" for further information.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P84_S0	Subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Company obtained a waiver for this noncompliance from the lenders.

1099800_12_ITEM7_P85_S1	The purchase price was funded with cash on hand and borrowings under the Credit Agreement.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P86_S0	Embrella was a start-up medical device company developing a device for cerebral embolic protection during cardiovascular procedures.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P87_S0	In February 2010, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions up to $500.0 million of the Company's common stock.

1099800_12_ITEM7_P88_S1	In addition to shares repurchased under the stock repurchase program, the Company also acquired shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock issued to employees.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P89_S0	Net cash flows provided by operating activities of $314.5 million for 2011 increased $63.1 million from 2010 due primarily to higher operating profits and a $49.1 million positive impact from decreased excess tax benefits from stock plans due to credit carryforwards and net operating losses in the United States in 2011 resulting in excess tax benefits that were not realized.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P89_S1	This increase was partially offset by higher working capital needs (primarily inventory and accounts receivables).
1099800_12_ITEM7_P90_S0	Net cash flows provided by operating activities of $251.4 million for 2010 increased $86.1 million from 2009 due primarily to (1) a $39.0 million cash payment during 2009 to terminate the Company's accounts receivable securitization program in Japan, (2) lower supplier payments in 2010 compared to 2009 and (3) higher operating profits.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P90_S1	These increases were partially offset by higher inventory purchases in 2010, primarily related to the transcatheter heart valve product line, and the negative impact from increased excess tax benefits from stock plans due to the appreciation in the Company's stock price and increased exercises (which is offset in financing activities).
1099800_12_ITEM7_P91_S0	Net cash used in investing activities of $412.8 million in 2011 consisted primarily of net purchases of short-term investments of $293.4 million, a $42.6 million payment associated with the acquisition of Embrella, and capital expenditures of $82.9 million.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P92_S0	Net cash used in investing activities of $61.5 million in 2010 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $61.8 million.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P93_S0	Net cash used in financing activities of $135.2 million in 2011 consisted primarily of net purchases of treasury stock of $303.4 million, partially offset by net proceeds from debt of $104.4 million and proceeds from stock plans of $59.5 million.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P94_S0	Net cash used in financing activities of $103.9 million in 2010 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of $200.0 million and net payments on debt of $48.4 million, partially offset by the proceeds from stock plans of $92.1 million and the excess tax benefit from stock plans of $55.1 million, which increased compared to the prior year due to the appreciation in the Company's stock price and increased exercises.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P95_S0	A summary of all of the Company's contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2011 were as follows (in millions):
1099800_12_ITEM7_P96_S0	The amount included in "Less Than 1 Year" reflects anticipated contributions to the Company's various pension plans.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P96_S1	Anticipated contributions beyond one year are not determinable.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P96_S2	The total accrued benefit liability for the Company's pension plans recognized as of December 31, 2011 was $41.8 million.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P97_S0	amount is impacted by, among other items, pension expense funding levels, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and investment return on plan assets.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P97_S1	Therefore, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid, and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P97_S2	See Note 11 to the " Consolidated Financial Statements " for further information.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P98_S0	(b) Contractual development obligations consist primarily of cash that the Company is obligated to pay upon achievement of product development and other milestones.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P98_S1	(c) Capital commitment obligations consist primarily of cash that the Company is obligated to pay to its limited partnership and limited liability corporation investees.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P98_S2	These investees make equity investments in various development stage biopharmaceutical and medical device companies, and it is not certain if and/or when these payments will be made.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P98_S3	(d) As of December 31, 2011, the liability for uncertain tax positions including interest was $81.2 million.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P99_S0	As a result of on-going negotiations of an Advanced Pricing Agreement between Switzerland and the United States, the expiration of statutes of limitations, and the possible settlement of on-going audits in several jurisdictions for multiple years throughout the world, the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P99_S1	The range of such change could vary, but the amount of such change is not expected to be material.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P100_S0	The Company's results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of the Company's accounting policies, as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P100_S1	Certain of the Company's accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ("GAAP").
1099800_12_ITEM7_P100_S2	In evaluating the Company's transactions, management assesses all relevant GAAP and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P101_S0	The application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P101_S1	As it relates to the Company, estimates and forecasts are required to determine sales returns and reserves, rebate reserves, allowances for doubtful accounts, reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, investments in unconsolidated affiliates, the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, the allocation of purchase price for acquisitions, workers' compensation liabilities, employee benefit related liabilities, income taxes, impairments of assets, forecasted transactions to be hedged, litigation reserves and contingencies.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P102_S0	These matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain, and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P102_S1	Management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements, using historical experience and all available information.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P102_S2	The Company also uses outside experts where appropriate.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P103_S0	The Company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P104_S0	The Company believes the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on the Company's reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P105_S0	The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P106_S0	Revenue is considered realized or realizable and earned upon delivery of the product, provided that an agreement of sale exists, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P106_S1	In the case of certain products where the Company maintains consigned inventory at customer locations, revenue is recognized at the time the Company is notified that the customer has used the inventory.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P107_S0	The Company's sales terms are standard terms within the medical device industry, with title and risk of loss transferring upon delivery to the customer, limited right of return and no unusual provisions or conditions.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P107_S1	When the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products, an estimate of various sales returns and allowances is recorded which reduces product sales and accounts receivable.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P107_S2	These adjustments include estimates for rebates, returns and other sales allowances.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P107_S3	These provisions are estimated and recorded at the time of sale based upon historical payment experience, historical relationship to revenues, estimated customer inventory levels, and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P107_S4	Product returns are not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P107_S5	If the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not approximate future activity, the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be impacted.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P108_S0	The Company's primary sales adjustment relates to distributor rebates which are given to the Company's United States distributors and represents the difference between the Company's sales price to the distributor (at the Company's distributor "list price") and the negotiated price to be paid by the end-customer.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P108_S1	This distributor rebate is recorded by the Company as a reduction to sales and a reduction to the distributor's accounts receivable at the time of sale to a distributor.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P108_S2	The Company validates the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from its distributors or an estimate of its distributor's inventory.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P108_S3	This distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P108_S4	The Company periodically monitors current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the credit for future distributor rebates is fairly stated.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P109_S0	The Company also offers volume rebates to certain GPOs and customers based upon target sales levels.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P109_S1	For volume rebates offered to GPOs, the rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and an obligation to the GPO.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P109_S2	For volume rebates offered to customers, the rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and accounts receivable.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P109_S3	The provision for volume rebates is estimated based on customers' contracted rebate programs and historical experience of rebates paid.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P109_S4	The Company periodically monitors its customer rebate programs to ensure that the allowance and liability for accrued rebates is fairly stated.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P110_S0	The Company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer-specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P111_S0	The credit and economic conditions within Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece, among other members of the European Union, have deteriorated as these countries have experienced slower economic growth and higher debt levels.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P111_S1	When evaluating its allowances for doubtful accounts related to these European receivables, the Company's analysis considers a number of factors including evidence of the customer's ability to comply with credit terms, economic conditions and procedures implemented by the Company to collect the historical receivables.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P111_S2	Additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances, if economic conditions are less favorable than the Company has anticipated, or for customer-specific circumstances, such as financial difficulty.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P111_S3	The allowance for doubtful accounts was $19.0 million and $11.6 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P112_S0	The Company records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P112_S1	Additional inventory allowances may be required if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the Company has estimated.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P113_S0	A write-down for excess or inactive inventory is recorded for inventory which is obsolete, nearing its expiration date (generally triggered at six months prior to expiration), is damaged or slow moving (defined as quantities in excess of a two year supply).
1099800_12_ITEM7_P113_S1	The allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was $12.9 million and $11.2 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P114_S0	The Company expenses legal costs incurred for patent preparation and applications.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P114_S1	The Company capitalizes certain legal costs related to the defense and enforcement of issued patents and trademarks.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P114_S2	These capitalized legal costs are amortized over the life of the related patent or trademark.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P114_S3	Such legal costs are periodically reviewed for impairment and recoverability.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P115_S0	The Company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P115_S1	In evaluating goodwill, the Company completes a two-step goodwill impairment test.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P115_S2	The Company identifies its reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities, including existing goodwill, to those reporting units.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P115_S3	The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based on the Company's market capitalization and a market revenue multiple.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P115_S4	If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company will perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P116_S0	The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill with its carrying value.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P116_S1	In 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company did not perform the second step of the impairment test as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P117_S0	Additionally, management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and long-lived tangible assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P117_S1	Impairment indicators include, among other conditions, cash flow deficits, historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit, and adverse legal or regulatory developments.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P117_S2	If it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable, based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization periods, their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P118_S0	Estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P118_S1	For the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment, long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P119_S0	Investments in unconsolidated affiliates are long-term equity investments in companies that are in various stages of development.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P119_S1	Certain of these investments are designated as available-for-sale.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P119_S2	Gains or losses on investments sold are based on the specific identification method.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P119_S3	Other investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for under the cost or the equity method of accounting, as appropriate.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P120_S0	The Company accounts for investments in limited partnerships or limited liability corporations, whereby the Company owns a minimum of 5% of the investee's outstanding voting stock, under the equity method of accounting.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P120_S1	These investments are recorded at the amount of the Company's investment and adjusted each period for the Company's share of the investee's income or loss and dividends paid.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P120_S2	As investments accounted for under the cost method do not have readily determinable fair value, the Company only estimates fair value if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that could have a significant adverse effect on the investment's fair value.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P121_S0	When the fair value of an available-for-sale investment declines below cost, management uses the following criteria to determine if such a decline should be considered other-than-temporary and result in a recognized loss:
1099800_12_ITEM7_P122_S0	the investee's performance against product development milestones; and the Company's ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P123_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P123_S1	The Company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and adjusting the amount, if necessary.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P123_S2	The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are both historical experience and the Company's forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P123_S3	Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the Company's effective tax rate on future earnings.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P124_S0	The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P124_S1	Significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company's uncertain tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P124_S2	The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that a position would more likely than not be sustained based upon its technical merit if challenged by the relevant taxing authority and taken by management to the court of last resort.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P124_S3	For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the relevant tax authority.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P125_S0	The Company strives to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P125_S1	While the Company has accrued for matters it believes are more likely than not to require settlement, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P125_S2	Furthermore, the Company may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise its right to appeal.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P125_S3	The uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation, regulations or case law.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P125_S4	Management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from these uncertain tax positions.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P126_S0	As a result of on-going negotiations of an Advanced Pricing Agreement, the expiration of statutes of limitations, and the possible settlement of on-going audits in several jurisdictions for multiple years throughout the world, the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P126_S1	The range of such change could vary, but the amount of such change is not expected to be material.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P127_S0	The Company has approximately $29.5 million of California research expenditure tax credits it expects to use in future periods.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P127_S1	The credits may be carried forward indefinitely.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P127_S2	Based upon anticipated future taxable income over an extended number of years, the Company expects all California research expenditure tax credits to be fully utilized; accordingly, no valuation allowance has been provided.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P128_S0	The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based awards based on estimated fair values.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P128_S1	Stock-based awards consist of stock options, restricted stock units and employee stock purchase subscriptions.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P128_S2	The fair value of each option award and employee stock purchase subscription is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P128_S3	The Black-Scholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions, including stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected option term.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P128_S4	Stock-based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P129_S0	required in estimating the stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P129_S1	If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and the Company's results of operations could be impacted.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P130_S0	In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an amendment to the accounting guidance on fair value measurements to ensure that United States GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards have common requirements for fair value measurement and disclosures, including a consistent definition of fair value.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P130_S1	The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P130_S2	The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P131_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P131_S1	The guidance eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders' equity, and instead requires that all nonowner changes in stockholders' equity be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P131_S2	The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P132_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting guidance on goodwill to permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P132_S1	The guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P132_S2	The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P133_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting guidance on disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P133_S1	The guidance requires an entity to disclose both gross and net information about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are eligible for offset in the consolidated balance sheet or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P133_S2	The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods.
1099800_12_ITEM7_P133_S3	The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The Company's business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets, including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The Company manages these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P0_S2	The Company uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts and option-based products to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P0_S3	The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	In addition to available cash and cash from operations, the Company uses short- and long-term debt to finance business activities.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P1_S1	The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its debt obligations.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P1_S2	The Company manages this risk through normal financing and investing activities and is not currently using derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P1_S3	A hypothetical 10% increase in the Company's weighted-average interest rate would have an immaterial effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The Company is exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P2_S1	These risks include the translation of local currency balances and results of the Company's non-United States subsidiaries into United States dollars, currency gains and losses related to intercompany and third-party transactions denominated in currencies other than a location's functional currency, and currency gains and losses associated with intercompany loans.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The Company's principal currency exposures relate to the Japanese yen and the Euro.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The Company's objective is to minimize the volatility of its exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and the use of derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options contracts.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The Company does not hedge its exposure related to its net investments in its non-United States subsidiaries.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P3_S3	The total notional amounts of the Company's derivative financial instruments entered into for foreign currency management purposes at December 31, 2011 and 2010 were $759.5 million and $539.2 million, respectively.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P3_S4	A hypothetical 10% increase/decrease in the value of the United States dollar against all hedged currencies would increase/decrease the fair value of these derivative contracts by $50.4 million and $51.7 million, respectively.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P3_S5	Any gains or losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions and would not be significant to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Derivative financial instruments involve credit risk in the event the financial institution counterparty should default.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P4_S1	It is the Company's policy to execute such instruments with major financial institutions that the Company believes to be creditworthy.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P4_S2	At December 31, 2011, all derivative financial instruments were with bank counterparties assigned investment grade ratings of "A" or better by national rating agencies.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P4_S3	The Company further diversifies its derivative financial instruments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P4_S4	The Company has not experienced a counterparty default and does not anticipate any non-performance by the Company's current derivative counterparties.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The Company invests excess cash in bank time deposits and diversifies the concentration of cash amongst different financial institutions.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P6_S0	In the normal course of business, Edwards Lifesciences provides credit to customers in the healthcare industry, performs credit evaluations of these customers and maintains allowances for potential credit losses which have historically been adequate compared to actual losses.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P7_S0	In 2011, the Company had no customers that represent greater than 10% of its total net sales or accounts receivable, net.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P8_S0	The Company continues to do business with foreign governments in certain European countries that have experienced a deterioration in credit and economic conditions.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P8_S1	These conditions have resulted in, and may continue to result in, an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect accounts receivable outstanding in these countries.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P8_S2	In addition, the Company may also be impacted by declines in sovereign credit ratings or sovereign defaults in these countries.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P9_S0	During 2011, the Company recorded a $12.8 million charge to reflect the increased risk associated with its Southern European receivables, primarily Greece.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P10_S0	will collect these accounts receivable, which could result in a negative impact to the Company's operating results.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P10_S1	As of December 31, 2011, the Company's accounts receivables, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, from customers in Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece were $113.7 million.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P11_S0	Edwards Lifesciences is exposed to investment risks related to changes in the fair values of its investments.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P11_S1	The Company invests in equity instruments of public and private companies.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P11_S2	These investments are classified in " Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates " on the consolidated balance sheets.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P12_S0	As of December 31, 2011, Edwards Lifesciences had $21.8 million of investments in equity instruments of other companies and had recorded unrealized gains of $1.1 million on these investments in " Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss ," net of tax.
1099800_12_ITEM7A_P12_S1	Should these companies experience a decline in financial condition or fail to meet certain development milestones, the decline in the investments' values may be considered other than temporary and impairment charges may be necessary.
1099800_12_ITEM9A_P0_S0	As previously reported in the Company's fourth quarter earnings press release, which was included in its Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 2, 2012, the Company determined that certain short-term investments were incorrectly shown as cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated condensed balance sheets and cash flow statements contained in its interim reports for the periods ended March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2011.
1099800_12_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Since that time, the Company also identified certain errors related to the presentation of the excess tax benefit from stock plans in its consolidated condensed statements of cash flows for the interim periods ended June 30 and September 30, 2011.
1099800_12_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
1099800_12_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of December 31, 2011.
1099800_12_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as a result of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting that is described below in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2011.
1099800_12_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Notwithstanding the material weakness identified in the evaluation, based upon additional analysis, the Company concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly present in all material respects the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1099800_12_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1099800_12_ITEM9A_P3_S1	The Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
1099800_12_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1099800_12_ITEM9A_P3_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1099800_12_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation as of December 31, 2011 of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based upon the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1099800_12_ITEM9A_P5_S0	A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1099800_12_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Management identified the following material weakness in internal control over financial reporting.
1099800_12_ITEM9A_P6_S0	The Company did not maintain effective controls over the completeness and timeliness of information impacting classification and disclosures related to financial reporting.
1099800_12_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Specifically, effective controls were not in place with respect to communication to appropriate financial reporting personnel from other departments of changes to information impacting classification and disclosures in the financial statements.
1099800_12_ITEM9A_P7_S0	classification error and to correct the amount presented as excess tax benefit from stock plans as a component of cash flows from operating and financing activities.
1099800_12_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Additionally, this control deficiency could result in other classification and disclosure misstatements related to financial reporting that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.
1099800_12_ITEM9A_P7_S2	Accordingly, the Company's management has determined that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness.
1099800_12_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Because of this material weakness, management concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework as issued by COSO.
1099800_12_ITEM9A_P9_S0	The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.
1099800_12_ITEM9A_P10_S0	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1099800_12_ITEM9A_P10_S1	Since December 31, 2011, the Company has begun the implementation of the remedial actions described below.
1099800_12_ITEM9A_P10_S2	There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company's fourth fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2011 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
1099800_12_ITEM9A_P11_S0	Plan for Remediation of Material Weakness.
1099800_12_ITEM9A_P11_S1	Beginning in February 2012, with the oversight of the Audit and Public Policy Committee, the Company's management began to design and implement certain remediation measures to address the material weakness discussed above and to improve its internal control over financial reporting.
1099800_12_ITEM9A_P11_S2	Specifically, the Company is enhancing its controls to improve the communication to appropriate financial reporting personnel from other departments of changes to information impacting classification and disclosures in the financial statements.

1099800_12_ITEM15_P324_S0	In connection with the Annual Report of Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (the "Company") on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof (the "Report"), we, Michael A. Mussallem, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and Thomas M. Abate, Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, certify, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that:

1099800_13_ITEM8_P0_S0	For the Years Ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010:
1099800_13_ITEM8_P1_S0	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Edwards Lifesciences Corporation:
1099800_13_ITEM8_P2_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Edwards Lifesciences Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P2_S1	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1099800_13_ITEM8_P2_S2	The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P2_S3	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P2_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1099800_13_ITEM8_P2_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P2_S6	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P2_S7	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P2_S8	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P2_S9	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P3_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P3_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P4_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P4_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1099800_13_ITEM8_P10_S0	Edwards Lifesciences Corporation ("Edwards Lifesciences" or the "Company") conducts operations worldwide and is managed in the following geographical regions: United States, Europe, Japan and Rest of World.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P10_S1	Edwards Lifesciences is focused on technologies that treat structural heart disease and critically ill patients.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P10_S2	A pioneer in the development and commercialization of heart valve products, Edwards Lifesciences is the world's leading manufacturer of tissue heart valves and repair products used to replace or repair a patient's diseased or defective heart valve.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P10_S3	The Company is also a global leader in hemodynamic monitoring systems used to measure a patient's cardiovascular function in the hospital setting.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P11_S0	The products and technologies provided by Edwards Lifesciences to treat advanced cardiovascular disease or critically ill patients are categorized into the following main areas:
1099800_13_ITEM8_P11_S1	Surgical Heart Valve Therapy; Transcatheter Heart Valves; and Critical Care.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P11_S2	The Company's Surgical Heart Valve Therapy portfolio includes tissue heart valves and heart valve repair products for the surgical replacement or repair of a patient's heart valve.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P11_S3	The portfolio also includes a diverse line of products used during minimally invasive surgical procedures, and cannulae, embolic protection devices and other products used during cardiopulmonary bypass procedures.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P12_S0	The Company's Transcatheter Heart Valves portfolio includes technologies designed to treat heart valve disease using catheter-based approaches as opposed to open surgical techniques.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P12_S1	In the Critical Care portfolio, Edwards Lifesciences' products include pulmonary artery catheters, disposable pressure transducers and advanced monitoring systems.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P12_S2	The portfolio also includes a line of balloon catheter-based vascular products, surgical clips and inserts.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P13_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Edwards Lifesciences and its majority-owned subsidiaries.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P13_S1	All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P14_S0	The consolidated financial statements of Edwards Lifesciences have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") which have been applied consistently in all material respects.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P14_S1	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P14_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P15_S0	When the local currency of the Company's foreign entities is the functional currency, all assets and liabilities are translated into United States dollars at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P15_S1	Income and expense items are translated at the weighted-average exchange rate prevailing during the period.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P16_S0	The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P17_S0	Revenue is considered realized or realizable and earned upon delivery of the product, provided that an agreement of sale exists, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P17_S1	In the case of certain products where the Company maintains consigned inventory at customer locations, revenue is recognized at the time the Company is notified that the customer has used the inventory.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P18_S0	The Company's sales terms are standard terms within the medical device industry, with title and risk of loss transferring upon delivery to the customer, limited right of return and no unusual provisions or conditions.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P18_S1	When the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products, an estimate of various sales returns and allowances is recorded which reduces product sales and accounts receivable.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P18_S2	These adjustments include estimates for rebates, returns and other sales allowances.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P18_S3	These provisions are estimated and recorded at the time of sale based upon historical payment experience, historical relationship to revenues, estimated customer inventory levels, and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P18_S4	Product returns are not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P18_S5	If the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not approximate future activity, the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be impacted.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P19_S0	The Company's primary sales adjustment relates to distributor rebates which are given to the Company's United States distributors and represents the difference between the Company's sales price to the distributor (at the Company's distributor "list price") and the negotiated price to be paid by the end-customer.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P19_S1	This distributor rebate is recorded by the Company as a reduction to sales and a reduction to the distributor's accounts receivable at the time of sale to a distributor.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P19_S2	The Company validates the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from its distributors or an estimate of its distributor's inventory.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P19_S3	This distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P19_S4	The Company periodically monitors current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the credit for future distributor rebates is fairly stated.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P20_S0	The Company also offers volume rebates to certain group purchasing organizations ("GPOs") and customers based upon target sales levels.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P20_S1	For volume rebates offered to GPOs, the rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and an obligation to the GPO, as the Company expects to pay in cash.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P20_S2	For volume rebates offered to customers, the rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and accounts receivable, as the Company expects a net payment from the customer.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P20_S3	The provision for volume rebates is estimated based on customers' contracted rebate programs and historical experience of rebates paid.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P20_S4	The Company periodically monitors its customer rebate programs to ensure that the allowance and liability for accrued rebates is fairly stated.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P21_S0	The Company considers highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P21_S1	These investments are valued at cost, which approximates fair value.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P22_S0	The Company invests in bank time deposits.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P22_S1	Bank time deposits with original maturities of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents, and bank time deposits with original maturities between three months and one year are classified as short-term investments.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P22_S2	Investments in bank time deposits are classified as held-to-maturity, as management has both the intent and ability to hold these investments to maturity, and are reported at cost, which approximates fair value.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P23_S0	The Company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer-specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P24_S0	The credit and economic conditions within Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece, among other members of the European Union, have deteriorated as these countries have experienced slower economic growth and higher debt levels.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P24_S1	When evaluating its allowances for doubtful accounts related to these European receivables, the Company's analysis considers a number of factors including evidence of the customer's ability to comply with credit terms, economic conditions and procedures implemented by the Company to collect the historical receivables.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P24_S2	Additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances, if economic conditions are less favorable than the Company has anticipated, or for customer-specific circumstances, such as financial difficulty.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P24_S3	The allowance for doubtful accounts was $12.0 million and $19.0 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P25_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market value.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P25_S1	Market value for raw materials is based on replacement costs, and for other inventory classifications is based on net realizable value.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P26_S0	A write-down for excess or inactive inventory is recorded for inventory which is obsolete, nearing its expiration date (generally triggered at six months prior to expiration), is damaged or slow moving (generally defined as quantities in excess of a two year supply).
1099800_13_ITEM8_P26_S1	The allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was $16.3 million and $12.9 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P27_S0	The Company allocates to inventory general and administrative costs that are related to the production process.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P27_S1	These costs include insurance, manufacturing accounting personnel, human resources personnel and information technology.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P27_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company allocated $26.2 million, $25.3 million and $23.4 million, respectively, of general and administrative costs to inventory.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P27_S3	General and administrative costs included in inventory at December 31, 2012 and 2011 were $15.1 million and $15.9 million, respectively.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P28_S0	Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P28_S1	Depreciation is principally calculated for financial reporting purposes on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from 10 to 40 years for buildings and improvements, from 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment, and from 3 to 10 years for software.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P28_S2	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the related facility leases or the asset, whichever is shorter.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P28_S3	Straight-line and accelerated methods of depreciation are used for income tax purposes.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P29_S0	Depreciation expense for property, plant and equipment was $44.0 million, $44.0 million and $40.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P29_S1	Repairs and maintenance expense was $20.6 million, $18.1 million and $16.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P30_S0	Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P31_S0	The Company identifies its reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities, including existing goodwill, to those reporting units.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P31_S1	The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based on the Company's market capitalization and a market revenue multiple.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P31_S2	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, then the Company measures the amount of the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P31_S3	In 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company did not record any impairment loss as the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its respective carrying value.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P32_S0	Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development ("IPR D") acquired in business combinations, is reviewed for impairment annually, or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P32_S1	An impairment loss is recognized when the asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P33_S0	Additionally, management reviews the carrying amounts of other finite-lived intangible assets and long-lived tangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P33_S1	Impairment indicators include, among other conditions, cash flow deficits, historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit, and adverse legal or regulatory developments.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P33_S2	If it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable, based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization periods, their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P34_S0	Estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P34_S1	For the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment, long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P35_S0	The estimated fair values of IPR D projects acquired in a business combination which have not reached technological feasibility are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P36_S0	project, the capitalized amount is amortized over its estimated useful life.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P36_S1	If the project is abandoned, all remaining capitalized amounts are written off immediately.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P37_S0	IPR D projects acquired in an asset acquisition are expensed unless the project has an alternative future use.

1099800_13_ITEM8_P38_S1	The Company capitalizes certain legal costs related to the defense and enforcement of issued patents and trademarks for which success is deemed probable.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P38_S2	These capitalized legal costs are amortized over the life of the related patent or trademark.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P38_S3	Such legal costs are periodically reviewed for impairment and recoverability.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P39_S0	Investments in unconsolidated affiliates are long-term equity investments in companies that are in various stages of development.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P39_S1	Certain of these investments are designated as available-for-sale.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P39_S2	Gains or losses on investments sold are based on the specific identification method.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P39_S3	Other investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for under the cost or the equity method of accounting, as appropriate.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P40_S0	The Company accounts for investments in limited partnerships or limited liability corporations, whereby the Company owns a minimum of 5% of the investee's outstanding voting stock, under the equity method of accounting.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P40_S1	These investments are recorded at the amount of the Company's investment and adjusted each period for the Company's share of the investee's income or loss and dividends paid.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P40_S2	As investments accounted for under the cost method do not have readily determinable fair values, the Company only estimates fair value if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that could have a significant adverse effect on the investment's fair value.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P41_S0	When the fair value of an available-for-sale investment declines below cost, management uses the following criteria to determine if such a decline should be considered other-than-temporary and result in a recognized loss:
1099800_13_ITEM8_P42_S0	the duration and extent to which the market value has been less than cost; the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee; the reasons for the decline in market value; the investee's performance against product development milestones; and the Company's ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P43_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P43_S1	The Company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and adjusting the amount, if necessary.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P43_S2	The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are both historical experience and the Company's forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P44_S0	jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the Company's effective tax rate on future earnings.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P45_S0	When assessing whether a windfall tax benefit relating to stock-based compensation has been realized, the Company follows the with and without approach, under which the windfall benefit is recognized only if an incremental benefit is provided after considering all other tax attributes presently available to the Company.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P45_S1	Consideration is given only to the direct impacts of stock awards when calculating the amount of windfalls and shortfalls.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P46_S0	The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P46_S1	Significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company's uncertain tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P46_S2	The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that a position would more likely than not be sustained based upon its technical merit if challenged by the relevant taxing authority and taken by management to the court of last resort.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P46_S3	For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the relevant tax authority.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P47_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P48_S0	Research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred.

1099800_13_ITEM8_P49_S1	Employee equity share options, nonvested shares and similar equity instruments granted by the Company are treated as potential common shares in computing diluted earnings per share.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P49_S2	Diluted shares outstanding include the dilutive effect of restricted stock units, market-based restricted stock units and in-the-money options.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P50_S0	The dilutive impact of the restricted stock units, market-based restricted stock units and in-the-money options is calculated based on the average share price for each fiscal period using the treasury stock method.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P50_S1	Under the treasury stock method, the amount that the employee must pay for exercising stock options, the amount of compensation expense for future service that the Company has not yet recognized, and the amount of tax benefits that would be recorded in " Additional Paid-in Capital " when the award becomes deductible are assumed to be used to repurchase shares.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P50_S2	Potential common share equivalents have been excluded where their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P51_S0	The table below presents the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (in millions, except for per share information):
1099800_13_ITEM8_P52_S0	Stock options, restricted stock units and market-based restricted stock units to purchase approximately 1.7 million, 1.0 million and 0.9 million shares for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, were outstanding, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P52_S1	Additionally, 0.1 million shares that would have been received if the accelerated share repurchase ("ASR") agreement discussed in Note 12 was settled as of December 31, 2012, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P53_S0	The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based awards based on estimated fair values.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P53_S1	Stock-based awards consist of stock options, restricted stock units, market-based restricted stock units, and employee stock purchase subscriptions.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P53_S2	Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period (vesting period) on a straight-line basis.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P53_S3	Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P54_S0	Upon exercise of stock options or vesting of restricted stock units and market-based restricted stock units, the Company issues common stock.

1099800_13_ITEM8_P56_S2	All remaining unvested restricted stock units are immediately forfeited.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P57_S0	For market-based restricted stock units, upon retirement and in certain other specified cases, a participant will receive a pro-rated portion of the shares that would ultimately be issued based on attainment of the performance goals as determined on the vesting date.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P57_S1	The pro-rated portion is based on the participant's whole months of service with the Company during the performance period prior to the date of termination.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P58_S0	The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risks.

1099800_13_ITEM8_P62_S0	In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an amendment to the accounting guidance on fair value measurements to ensure that United States GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards have common requirements for fair value measurement and disclosures, including a consistent definition of fair value.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P62_S1	The guidance was effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P62_S2	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P63_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P63_S1	The guidance eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income ("OCI") as part of the statement of changes in stockholders' equity, and instead requires that all nonowner changes in stockholders' equity be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.

1099800_13_ITEM8_P157_S4	The May ASR agreement concluded in August 2012, and upon final settlement, the Company had received a total of 0.5 million shares at an average price per share of $97.50 based on the VWAP of the Company's common stock during the term of the agreement.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P158_S0	In November 2012, the Company entered into another ASR agreement with a different investment bank to repurchase $100.0 million of the Company's common stock.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P158_S1	The November ASR agreement provides for the repurchase of the Company's common stock based on the VWAP of the Company's common stock during the term of the agreement, less a discount, and is subject to collar provisions that established minimum and maximum number of shares to be repurchased.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P158_S2	In November 2012, the Company paid the $100.0 million purchase price and received an initial delivery of 1.1 million shares, representing the minimum number of shares to be repurchased under the agreement.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P158_S3	The initial shares were valued at $85.73 per share based on the VWAP of the Company's common stock on November 19, 2012, which was the date the major terms of the November ASR agreement were finalized, and represented approximately 90 percent of the total contract value.

1099800_13_ITEM8_P159_S0	The ASR agreements were accounted for as two separate transactions: (a) the value of the initial delivery of shares was recorded as shares of common stock acquired in a treasury stock transaction on the acquisition date and (b) the remaining amount of the purchase price paid was recorded as a forward contract indexed to the Company's own common stock and was recorded in " Additional Paid-in Capital " on the consolidated balance sheets.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P160_S0	The initial delivery of shares resulted in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted-average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P160_S1	The Company determined that the forward contract indexed to the Company's common stock met all the applicable criteria for equity classification and, therefore, was not accounted for as a derivative instrument.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P161_S0	The Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Long-Term Stock Incentive Compensation Program (the "Program") provides for the grant of incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units for eligible employees and contractors of the Company.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P161_S1	Under the Program, these grants are awarded at a price equal to the fair market value at the date of grant based upon the closing price on that date.

1099800_13_ITEM8_P163_S1	The actual number of shares issued will be determined based on the Company's total shareholder return relative to a selected industry peer group over a three-year performance period, and may range from 0 percent to 175 percent of the targeted number of shares granted.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P163_S2	On May 10, 2012, an amendment and restatement of the Program was approved by the Company's stockholders.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P163_S3	Under the amended Program, the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the Program was increased by 1.5 million shares to a total available for issuance of 47.4 million shares.

1099800_13_ITEM8_P164_S3	Each option and restricted stock unit award granted in 2011 or prior generally vests in three equal annual installments.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P164_S4	Each option and restricted stock unit award granted after 2011 generally vests after one year.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P164_S5	Upon a director's initial election to the Board, the director receives an initial grant of restricted stock units equal to a fair market value on grant date of $0.2 million, not to exceed 10,000 shares.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P164_S6	These grants vest over three years from the date of grant.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P165_S0	Under the Nonemployee Directors Program, an aggregate of 1.4 million shares of the Company's common stock has been authorized for issuance.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P166_S0	The Company has an employee stock purchase plan for United States employees and a plan for international employees (collectively "ESPP").
1099800_13_ITEM8_P166_S1	Under the ESPP, eligible employees may purchase shares of the Company's common stock at 85% of the lower of the fair market value of Edwards Lifesciences common stock on the effective date of subscription or the date of purchase.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P166_S2	Under the ESPP, employees can authorize the Company to withhold up to 12% of their compensation for common stock purchases, subject to certain limitations.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P166_S3	The ESPP is available to all active employees of the Company paid from the United States payroll and to eligible employees of the Company outside the United States to the extent permitted by local law.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P166_S4	The ESPP for United States employees is qualified under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P166_S5	The number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the ESPP was 5.9 million shares.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P167_S0	The fair value of each option award and employee stock purchase subscription is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the assumptions noted in the following tables.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P167_S1	The risk-free interest rate is estimated using the U.S. Treasury yield curve and is based on the expected term of the award.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P168_S0	Expected volatility is estimated based on the historical-implied volatility of publicly traded options of its common stock with a term of one year or greater.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P168_S1	The expected term of awards granted is estimated from the vesting period of the award, as well as historical exercise behavior, and represents the period of time that awards granted are expected to be outstanding.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P169_S0	The Company uses historical data to estimate forfeitures and has estimated an annual forfeiture rate of 6.4%.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P170_S0	The Black-Scholes option pricing model was used with the following weighted-average assumptions for options granted during the following periods:
1099800_13_ITEM8_P171_S0	The Black-Scholes option pricing model was used with the following weighted-average assumptions for ESPP subscriptions granted during the following periods:
1099800_13_ITEM8_P172_S0	The fair value of market-based restricted stock units was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which uses multiple input variables to determine the probability of satisfying the market condition requirements.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P172_S1	The weighted-average assumptions used to determine the fair value of the market-based restricted stock units included a 0.3 percent risk-free interest rate and a 30.4 percent expected volatility rate.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P173_S0	Stock option activity during the year ended December 31, 2012 under the Program and the Nonemployee Directors Program was as follows (in millions, except years and per-share amounts):
1099800_13_ITEM8_P174_S0	The following table summarizes nonvested restricted stock unit activity during the year ended December 31, 2012 under the Program and the Nonemployee Directors Program (in millions, except per-share amounts):
1099800_13_ITEM8_P175_S0	(a) Includes 47,275 shares of market-based restricted stock units granted during 2012, which represents the targeted number of shares to be issued.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P175_S1	As described above, the actual number of shares ultimately issued will be determined based on the Company's total shareholder return relative to a selected industry peer group.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P176_S0	The intrinsic value of stock options exercised and restricted stock units vested during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $252.8 million, $180.7 million and $190.9 million, respectively.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P177_S0	The intrinsic value of stock options is calculated as the amount by which the market price of the Company's common stock exceeds the exercise price of the option.

1099800_13_ITEM8_P177_S2	The total grant-date fair value of stock options vested during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $19.5 million, $16.9 million and $15.8 million, respectively.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P178_S0	As of December 31, 2012, the total remaining unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested stock options, restricted stock units, market-based restricted stock units and employee stock purchase subscriptions amounted to $70.7 million, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining requisite service period of 30 months.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P179_S0	Presented below is a summary of activity for each component of " Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss " for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P180_S0	Foreign currency translation adjustments are generally not adjusted for income taxes as they relate to indefinite investments in non-United States subsidiaries.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P181_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the change in unrealized pension costs consisted of the following (in millions):

1099800_13_ITEM8_P184_S0	The components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in millions):
1099800_13_ITEM8_P185_S0	During 2012, net deferred tax assets increased $25.4 million, including items that were recorded to stockholders' equity and which did not impact the Company's income tax provision.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P186_S0	The valuation allowance of $38.6 million as of December 31, 2012 reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P186_S1	This allowance primarily relates to the net operating loss carryforwards of certain United States and non-United States subsidiaries and to the deferred tax assets established for impairment losses on certain investments and for certain non-United States credit carryforwards.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P187_S0	Net operating loss, charitable contribution and tax credit carryforwards, and the related carryforward periods, at December 31, 2012, are summarized as follows (in millions):
1099800_13_ITEM8_P188_S0	A valuation allowance of $2.8 million has been provided for other-than-temporary impairments and unrealized losses related to certain investments in unconsolidated affiliates that may not be recognized due to the uncertainty of the ready marketability of certain impaired investments.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P189_S0	The Company has $38.4 million of California research expenditure tax credits it expects to use in future periods.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P189_S1	The credits may be carried forward indefinitely.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P189_S2	Based upon anticipated future taxable income, the Company expects that it is more likely than not that all California research expenditure tax credits will be utilized, although the utilization of the full benefit is expected to occur over a number of years and into the far distant future.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P189_S3	Accordingly, no valuation allowance has been provided.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P190_S0	The United States state net operating loss carryforwards include $143.0 million of losses attributable to windfall stock option deductions.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P190_S1	A net benefit of $4.8 million will be recorded to " Additional Paid-in Capital " when realized as a reduction to income taxes payable.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P191_S0	The United States federal net operating loss carryforward of $16.8 million is attributable to windfall stock option deductions.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P191_S1	A net benefit of $5.9 million will be recorded to " Additional Paid-in Capital " when realized as a reduction to income taxes payable.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P192_S0	Approximately $64.6 million of the total $96.0 million United States federal and state tax credit and charitable contribution carryforwards are attributable to windfall stock option deductions and will be recorded as a benefit to " Additional Paid-in Capital " when realized as a reduction to income taxes payable.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P193_S0	Deferred income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries of approximately $1,135.9 million as of December 31, 2012 since these amounts are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P193_S1	It is not practicable to calculate the deferred taxes associated with these earnings because of the variability of multiple factors that would need to be assessed at the time of any assumed repatriation; however, foreign tax credits would likely be available to reduce federal income taxes in the event of distribution.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P193_S2	In making this assertion, the Company evaluates, among other factors, the profitability of its United States and foreign operations and the need for cash within and outside the United States, including cash requirements for capital improvement, acquisitions, market expansion and stock repurchase programs.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P193_S3	Additionally, in 2010, the Company entered into a plan to repatriate all of the accumulated earnings from certain of its European subsidiaries.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P193_S4	The Company does not expect earnings in these European subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and records the tax impact in net income currently.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P194_S0	The Company has received tax incentives in Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Singapore and Switzerland.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P194_S1	The tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rates favorably impacted earnings per diluted share for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 by $0.39, $0.40 and $0.34, respectively.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P194_S2	The Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Singapore and Switzerland grants provide the Company's manufacturing operations partial or full exemption from local taxes until the years 2028, 2017, 2024 and 2015, respectively.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P194_S3	In 2012, the Company negotiated a new Puerto Rico grant with the Puerto Rican government with an extended term until 2028.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P195_S0	A reconciliation of the United States federal statutory income tax rate to the Company's effective income tax rate is as follows (in millions):
1099800_13_ITEM8_P196_S0	The federal research credit expired on December 31, 2011 and was not reinstated until January 2, 2013.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P196_S1	As a result, the effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2012 has been calculated without a benefit for the federal research credit.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P196_S2	Had the federal research credit been recorded in 2012, it would have favorably impacted the effective tax rate by 2.0 percentage points, or $8.4 million.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P197_S0	The Company estimates that these liabilities would be reduced by $26.1 million and $6.8 million, respectively, from offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes and timing adjustments.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P197_S1	The net amounts of $87.5 million and $71.2 million, respectively, if not required, would favorably affect the Company's effective tax rate.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P198_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest, penalties and foreign exchange, is as follows (in millions):
1099800_13_ITEM8_P199_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P199_S1	As of December 31, 2012, the Company had accrued $3.1 million (net of $2.1 million tax benefit) of interest related to uncertain tax positions, and as of December 31, 2011, the Company had accrued $2.0 million (net of $1.2 million tax benefit) of interest related to uncertain tax positions.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P199_S2	During 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company recognized interest expense, net of tax benefit, of $1.0 million, $0.4 million and ($0.9) million, respectively, in " Provision for Income Taxes " on the consolidated statements of operations.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P200_S0	The Company strives to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P200_S1	While the Company has accrued for matters it believes are more likely than not to require settlement, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P200_S2	Furthermore, the Company may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise its right to appeal.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P200_S3	The uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation, regulations or case law.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P201_S0	At December 31, 2012, all material state, local and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2006.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P201_S1	The Internal Revenue Service has completed its examination of the Company's 2007 and 2008 tax years, including certain transfer pricing issues that were under appeal.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P201_S2	The appeals process for those transfer pricing issues was finalized during the third quarter of 2012.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P202_S0	The Internal Revenue Service began its examination of the 2009 and 2010 tax years during the second quarter of 2011.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P203_S0	As a result of on-going negotiations of an Advanced Pricing Agreement between Switzerland and the United States, the expiration of statutes of limitations, and the possible settlement of on-going audits in several jurisdictions for multiple years throughout the world, the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P203_S1	The range of such change could vary, but the amount of such change is not expected to be material.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P204_S0	In February 2008, Edwards Lifesciences filed a lawsuit against CoreValve, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that its ReValving System infringes three of Edwards' U.S. Andersen patents, later narrowed to one patent ("the '552 patent").
1099800_13_ITEM8_P205_S0	CoreValve, Inc. ("Medtronic CoreValve") in April 2009.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P205_S1	In April 2010, a federal jury found the '552 patent to be valid and found that Medtronic CoreValve willfully infringes it.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P205_S2	The jury also awarded Edwards $73.9 million in damages.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P205_S3	In February 2011, the District Court reaffirmed the jury decision and ruled that Edwards is entitled to recover additional damages due to Medtronic CoreValve's continued infringing sales from the trial through the life of the patent, plus interest.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P205_S4	In the same ruling, the court denied Edwards' motions for a permanent injunction, as well as its motion for increased damages relating to Medtronic CoreValve's willful infringement.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P205_S5	In November 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the April 2010 federal jury decision that Medtronic CoreValve is willfully infringing the '552 patent and ordered the trial court to reconsider Edwards' request for a permanent injunction that would prohibit the manufacture or sale of the CoreValve System in the United States.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P205_S6	The Court of Appeals also affirmed the validity of the '552 patent and the federal jury's verdict awarding an initial payment of $73.9 million in damages to Edwards, which covers infringement through early 2010.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P205_S7	In February 2013, the Court of Appeals issued a mandate affirming the judgment of the District Court and directing it to reconsider its prior denial of Edwards' request for a permanent injunction.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P205_S8	The mandate renders enforceable the initial jury damages award, and restores jurisdiction to the District Court to assess additional damages for the period after the date of the jury award.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P206_S0	A second lawsuit is pending in the same trial court against Medtronic CoreValve and Medtronic alleging infringement of three of Edwards' U.S. Andersen patents.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P207_S0	In May 2012, the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO") granted Medtronic's fourth request to reexamine the validity of the claim of the '552 patent and in February 2013 confirmed the validity of that patent.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P208_S0	In June 2011, Medtronic filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota alleging that certain surgical valve holders and a surgical embolic filter device infringe its patents.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P208_S1	Edwards counterclaimed against Medtronic, alleging that the Medtronic Contour 3D annuloplasty ring infringes an Edwards ring patent.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P208_S2	Edwards subsequently added two more patents to its counterclaim.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P208_S3	In February and March 2012, the USPTO granted Edwards' requests to reexamine the validity of three of the four Medtronic patents involved in this lawsuit.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P209_S0	In June 2011, Medtronic CoreValve also filed another lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California alleging that the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve infringes a Medtronic CoreValve patent.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P210_S0	Edwards counterclaimed against Medtronic CoreValve and Medtronic, alleging that the Medtronic CoreValve heart valve infringes Edwards' U.S.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P210_S1	Edwards' counterclaim was subsequently transferred to the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, where proceedings continue.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P211_S0	In April 2012, the USPTO granted Edwards' request to reexamine the validity of the Medtronic CoreValve patent.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P211_S1	In November 2012, the California court ruled that the Medtronic CoreValve patent is invalid and dismissed the lawsuit in favor of Edwards.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P212_S0	In March 2012, Medtronic filed another lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California alleging that the methods of implanting the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve in the United States infringes two Medtronic patents relating to methods of pacing the heart.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P213_S0	In August 2012, Edwards filed a lawsuit against Medtronic in the German District Court of Mannheim alleging that Medtronic's CoreValve and Evolut valves infringe two of Edwards' transcatheter valve patents.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P214_S0	The matter is scheduled for trial in April 2013.
1099800_13_ITEM8_P214_S1	Related oppositions on the validity of these patents are ongoing at the European Patent Office.

1099800_13_ITEM1_P58_S1	Many Company trademarks have also been registered for use in certain foreign countries where registration is available and Edwards Lifesciences has determined it is commercially advantageous to do so.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P59_S0	The Company's products and technologies are subject to regulation by numerous domestic and foreign government agencies, including the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), and various laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of the Company's products and technologies.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P59_S1	The Company is also governed by federal, state, local and international laws of general applicability, such as those regulating employee health and safety and the protection of the environment.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P59_S2	Overall, the amount and scope of domestic and foreign laws and regulations applicable to the Company's business is increasing.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P60_S0	In the United States, the FDA has responsibility for regulating medical devices.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P60_S1	The FDA regulates design, development, testing, clinical studies, manufacturing, labeling, promotion and record-keeping for medical devices, and reporting of adverse events, recalls, or other field actions by manufacturers and users to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P60_S2	Many of the devices that Edwards Lifesciences develops and markets are in a category for which the FDA has implemented stringent clinical investigation and pre-market clearance or approval requirements.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P60_S3	The process of obtaining FDA clearance or approval to market a product is resource intensive, lengthy and costly.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P60_S4	FDA review may involve substantial delays that adversely affect the marketing and sale of Edwards Lifesciences' products.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P60_S5	A number of the Company's products are pending regulatory clearance or approval to begin commercial sales in various markets.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P60_S6	Ultimately, the FDA may not authorize the commercial release of a medical device if it determines the device is not safe and effective or does not meet other standards for clearance.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P60_S7	Additionally, even if a product is cleared or approved, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of these products once commercialized.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P61_S0	preclude the importation of devices that are or appear violative.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P61_S1	The FDA also conducts inspections to determine compliance with the quality system regulations concerning the manufacturing and design of devices and current medical device reporting regulations, recall regulations, clinical testing regulations, and other requirements.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P61_S2	The FDA may withdraw product clearances or approvals due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P61_S3	Additionally, the failure to comply with FDA or comparable regulatory standards or the discovery of previously unknown product problems could result in fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances or approvals, seizures, injunctions, recalls, refunds, civil money penalties, or criminal prosecution.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P61_S4	The Company's compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P61_S5	Moreover, the FDA and several other United States agencies administer controls over the export of medical devices from the United States and the importation of devices into the United States, which could also subject the Company to sanctions for noncompliance.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P62_S0	The Company is also subject to additional laws and regulations that govern its business operations, products and technologies, including:
1099800_13_ITEM1_P63_S0	federal, state and foreign anti-kickback laws and regulations, which generally prohibit payments to physicians or other purchasers of medical products as an inducement to purchase a product; the Stark law, which prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to a provider that bills these programs for the provision of certain designated health services if the physician (or a member of the physician's immediate family) has a financial relationship with that provider; federal and state laws and regulations that protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient records, and restrict the use and disclosure of such information, in particular, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996; the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires public disclosure of the financial relationships of United States physicians and teaching hospitals with applicable manufacturers, including medical device, pharmaceutical and biologics companies; the False Claims Act, which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claims for payment to a federally funded health care program, and health care fraud statutes that prohibit false statements and improper claims to any third-party payor; and the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which can be used to prosecute companies in the United States for arrangements with foreign government officials or other parties outside the United States.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P64_S0	Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal liability, significant fines or penalties, negative publicity and substantial costs and expenses associated with investigation and enforcement activities.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P64_S1	To assist in the Company's compliance efforts, the Company adheres to many codes of ethics and conduct regarding its sales and marketing activities in the United States and other countries in which it operates.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P64_S2	In addition, the Company has in place a dedicated team to improve its internal business compliance programs and policies.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P65_S0	Internationally, the regulation of medical devices is complex.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P65_S1	In Europe, the Company's products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P65_S2	The regulatory regime in the European Union for medical devices became mandatory in June 1998.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P65_S3	It requires that medical devices may only be placed on the market if they do not compromise safety and health when properly installed, maintained and used in accordance with their intended purpose.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P66_S0	National laws conforming to the European Union's legislation regulate the Company's products under the medical devices regulatory system.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P67_S0	The European Union medical device laws require manufacturers to declare that their products conform to the essential regulatory requirements after which the products may be placed on the market bearing the CE Mark.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P67_S1	Manufacturers' quality systems for products in all but the lowest risk classification are also subject to certification and audit by an independent notified body.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P68_S0	In Europe, particular emphasis is being placed on more sophisticated and faster procedures for the reporting of adverse events to the competent authorities.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P69_S0	In Japan, pre-market approval and clinical studies are required as is governmental pricing approval for medical devices.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P69_S1	Clinical studies are subject to a stringent "Good Clinical Practices" standard.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P69_S2	Approval time frames from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare vary from simple notifications to review periods of one or more years, depending on the complexity and risk level of the device.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P69_S3	In addition, importation into Japan of medical devices is subject to the "Good Import Practices" regulations.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P69_S4	As with any highly regulated market, significant changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect future sales.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P70_S0	In many of the other foreign countries in which the Company markets its products, the Company may be subject to regulations affecting, among other things:
1099800_13_ITEM1_P71_S0	product standards and specifications; packaging requirements; labeling requirements; quality system requirements; import restrictions; tariffs; duties; and tax requirements.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P72_S0	Many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the FDA.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P72_S1	In some regions, the level of government regulation of medical devices is increasing, which can lengthen time to market and increase registration and approval costs.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P73_S0	In many countries, the national health or social security organizations require the Company's products to be qualified before they can be marketed and considered eligible for reimbursement.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P74_S0	Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs, including price regulation and competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements, are continuing in many countries where Edwards Lifesciences does business, including the United States, Europe and Japan.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P74_S1	As a result of these changes, the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical therapies.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P74_S2	For example, government programs, private health care insurance and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for procedures or treatments, and some third-party payors require their pre-approval before new or innovative devices or therapies are utilized by patients.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P74_S3	These various initiatives have created increased price sensitivity over medical products generally and may impact demand for the Company's products and technologies.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P75_S0	The delivery of the Company's products is subject to regulation by the Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") and comparable state and foreign agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P75_S1	Foreign governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P76_S0	Reimbursement schedules regulate the amount the United States government will reimburse hospitals and doctors for the inpatient care of persons covered by Medicare.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P76_S1	CMS may also review whether and/or under what circumstances a procedure or technology is reimbursable.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P77_S0	the United States have been advanced that would restrict future funding increases for government-funded programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P77_S1	Changes in current reimbursement levels could have an adverse effect on market demand and the Company's pricing flexibility.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P78_S0	Hospital reimbursement in the United States for transcatheter aortic valve replacement ("TAVR") procedures is currently aligned with surgical aortic valve replacement codes.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P78_S1	On May 1, 2012, CMS issued a National Coverage Determination ("NCD") that provided nationwide coverage of TAVR for patients who either fall within FDA-approved criteria or are part of an approved clinical study.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P78_S2	The Company has always believed a well-written NCD that ensures adequate patient access is a positive for patients and physicians.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P79_S0	Health care cost containment efforts have also prompted domestic hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power, and this trend is expected to continue.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P79_S1	The medical device industry has also experienced some consolidation, partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P79_S2	As a result, transactions with customers are larger, more complex and tend to involve more long-term contracts than in the past.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P79_S3	These larger customers, due to their enhanced purchasing power, may attempt to increase the pressure on product pricing.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P80_S0	In 2010, significant reforms to the health care system were adopted as law in the United States.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P80_S1	The law includes provisions that, among other things, reduce or limit Medicare reimbursement, require all individuals to have health insurance (with limited exceptions) and impose increased taxes.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P80_S2	Specifically, the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize health care reform in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on United States sales of most medical devices beginning in 2013.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P80_S3	The excise tax will increase the Company's operating expenses.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P81_S0	Because many other parts of the 2010 health care law remain subject to implementation, the long-term impact on the Company is uncertain.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P81_S1	The new law or any future legislation could reduce medical procedure volumes, lower reimbursement for the Company's products, and impact the demand for the Company's products or the prices at which the Company sells its products.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P82_S0	On October 25, 2010, the Puerto Rican government enacted a new tax law effective for transactions occurring after December 31, 2010.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P82_S1	The law, Act 154, modifies Puerto Rican tax law by imposing a temporary excise tax on intercompany purchases made through 2016 and by adopting a new sourcing rule.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P82_S2	The Company projects that the excise tax impact for 2012 of $5.9 million will be offset by credits available under the implementing excise tax regulations.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P82_S3	The financial impact of the new sourcing rule is not expected to be material.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P83_S0	The Puerto Rican government recently announced plans effective in 2013 to increase the excise tax rate to four percent and to maintain that level through 2017.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P83_S1	The Company projects that the excise tax impact for 2013 of approximately $5.3 million will be fully offset by credits.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P84_S0	Edwards Lifesciences' quarterly net sales are influenced by many factors, including new product introductions, acquisitions, regulatory approvals, patient and physician holiday schedules, and other factors.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P84_S1	Net sales in the third quarter are typically lower than other quarters of the year due to the seasonality of the United States and European markets, where summer vacation schedules normally result in fewer medical procedures.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P85_S0	As of December 31, 2012, Edwards Lifesciences had approximately 8,200 employees worldwide, the majority of whom were located in the United States, the Dominican Republic, and Singapore.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P85_S1	Other major concentrations of employees are located in Europe and Japan.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P86_S0	Edwards Lifesciences emphasizes competitive compensation, benefits, equity participation and work environment practices in its efforts to attract and retain qualified personnel, and employs a rigorous talent management system.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P87_S0	American employees are represented by a labor union.
1099800_13_ITEM1_P87_S1	In various countries outside of North America, the Company interacts with trade unions and work councils that represent a limited number of employees.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our business and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	An investor should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P0_S3	If any of these events or circumstances occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially harmed.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P0_S4	In that case, the value of our securities could decline and an investor could lose part or all of his or her investment.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P0_S5	In addition, forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws that are contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in our other filings or statements may be subject to the risks described below as well as other risks and uncertainties.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P0_S6	Please read the cautionary notice regarding forward-looking statements in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our products may become obsolete and our operating results may suffer.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The cardiovascular products industry is characterized by technological changes, frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Without the timely introduction of new and improved products, our products could become technologically obsolete or more susceptible to competition and our revenue and operating results would suffer.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Even if we are able to develop new or improved products, our ability to market them could be limited by the need for regulatory clearance, restrictions imposed on approved indications, entrenched patterns of clinical practice, uncertainty over third-party reimbursement or other factors.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P2_S3	We devote significant financial and other resources to our research and development activities; however, the research and development process is prolonged and entails considerable uncertainty.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Accordingly, products we are currently developing may not complete the development process or obtain the regulatory or other approvals required to market such products in a timely manner or at all.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Technical innovations often require substantial time and investment before we can determine their commercial viability.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We may not have the financial resources necessary to fund all of these projects.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	In addition, even if we are able to successfully develop new or improved products, they may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development, and they may be rendered obsolete or less competitive by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products with newer technologies or features or other factors.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We may incur product liability losses that could adversely affect our operating results.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P5_S2	In addition, many of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product related risks or product related information could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, patients.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Such a problem could result in product liability lawsuits and claims, safety alerts or product recalls in the future, which, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Product liability claims may be brought from time to time either by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We may incur charges related to such matters in excess of any established reserves and such charges, including the establishment of any such reserves, could have a material adverse impact on our net income and net cash flows.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We may experience supply interruptions that could harm our ability to manufacture products.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We use a broad range of raw and organic materials and other items in the design and manufacture of our products.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Our Surgical and Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy products are manufactured from treated natural animal tissue and man-made materials.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Our non-implantable products are manufactured from man-made raw materials including resins, chemicals, electronics and metals.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P9_S3	We purchase certain of the materials and components used in the manufacture of our products from external suppliers, and we purchase certain supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance, cost-effectiveness, availability or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P9_S4	General economic conditions could adversely affect the financial viability of our suppliers, resulting in their inability to provide materials and components used in the manufacture of our products.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P9_S5	While we work closely with suppliers to monitor their financial viability and to assure continuity of supply and maintain high quality and reliability, these efforts may not be successful.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P9_S6	In addition, due to the rigorous regulations and requirements of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products (including the need for approval of any change in supply arrangements), we may have difficulty establishing additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or at all if the need arises.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P9_S7	Although alternative supplier options are considered and identified, we typically do not pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships and the time and expense associated with the regulatory validation process.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P9_S8	A change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to product performance or incorporate unique technology, and the loss of any existing supply contract could have a material adverse effect on us.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Regulatory agencies in the United States or other international geographies from time to time have limited or banned the use of certain materials used in the manufacture of our products.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	In these circumstances, transition periods typically provide time to arrange for alternative materials.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	In addition, the SEC recently enacted disclosure rules regarding products that may contain certain minerals that originate from conflict areas in and around the Democratic Republic of Congo.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P10_S3	If our suppliers cannot certify that their components do not originate from these conflict areas, we may need to source components from alternative suppliers.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P10_S4	If we are unable to identify alternative materials or suppliers and secure approval for their use in a timely manner, our business could be harmed.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Some of our suppliers are located outside the United States.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	As a result, trade or regulatory embargoes imposed by foreign countries or the United States could result in delays or shortages that could harm our business.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	If we or one of our suppliers encounters manufacturing or quality problems, our business could suffer.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls, due in part to rigorous regulatory requirements.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	In addition, quality is extremely important due to the serious and costly consequences of a product failure.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Problems can arise during the manufacturing process for a number of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow protocols and procedures, raw material problems or human error.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P13_S3	If these problems arise or if we otherwise fail to meet our internal quality standards or those of the FDA or other applicable regulatory body, which include detailed record-keeping requirements, our reputation could be damaged, we could become subject to a safety alert or a recall, we could incur product liability and other costs, product approvals could be delayed and our business could otherwise be adversely affected.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We may be required, from time to time, to recognize charges in connection with the write-down of our investments, asset or business dispositions, or for other reasons.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We have equity investments in other companies, and we may make similar investments in the future.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	To the extent that the value of any of these investments declines, we may be required to recognize charges to write down the value of that investment.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	At December 31, 2012, we had $21.1 million of investments in equity instruments of other companies and had recorded unrealized gains of $1.4 million on these investments on our consolidated balance sheet in " Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss ," net of tax.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	In addition, from time to time we identify businesses and products that are not performing at a level commensurate with the rest of our business.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	We may seek to dispose of these underperforming businesses or products.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We may also seek to dispose of other businesses or products for strategic or other business reasons.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P17_S3	If we cannot dispose of a business or product on acceptable terms, we may voluntarily cease operations related to that business or product.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Any of these events could result in charges, which could be substantial and which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We may not successfully identify and complete acquisitions or strategic alliances on favorable terms or achieve anticipated synergies relating to any acquisitions or alliances, and such acquisitions could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, require significant management resources and require significant charges or write-downs.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We regularly explore potential acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, as well as potential strategic alliances.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates or appropriate partners with which to form alliances.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Even if we identify appropriate acquisition or alliance candidates, we may be unable to complete the acquisitions or alliances on favorable terms, if at all.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P19_S3	In addition, the process of integrating an acquired business, technology, service or product into our existing operations could result in unforeseen difficulties and expenditures.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Integration of an acquired company often requires significant expenditures as well as significant management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our other businesses.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Moreover, we may not realize the anticipated financial or other benefits of an acquisition or alliance.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We may be required to take charges or write-downs in connection with acquisitions.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	In particular, acquisitions of businesses engaged in the development of new products may give rise to in-process research and development assets.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P20_S2	To the extent that the value of these assets declines, we may be required to write down the value of the assets.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Also, in connection with certain asset acquisitions, we may be required to take an immediate charge related to acquired in-process research and development.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Either of these situations could result in substantial charges, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Future acquisitions could also involve the issuance of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization of expenses related to other intangible assets, any of which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	In addition, equity or debt financing required for such acquisitions may not be available.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	General economic and political conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	External factors can affect our profitability and financial condition.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Such external factors include general domestic and global economic conditions, such as interest rates, tax rates and factors affecting global economic stability, and the political environment regarding health care in general.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P23_S2	While the economic environment has shown some signs of improvement, the strength and timing of any economic recovery remains uncertain, and we cannot predict to what extent the global economic slowdown may negatively impact our business.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	An increase in interest rates could result in an increase in our borrowing costs and could otherwise restrict our ability to access the capital markets.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Such conditions could result in decreased liquidity and impairments in the carrying value of our investments, and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P24_S2	These and other conditions could also adversely affect our customers, and may impact their ability or decision to purchase our products or make payments on a timely basis.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	In 2010, significant reforms to the health care system were adopted as law in the United States.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	The law includes provisions that, among other things, reduce or limit Medicare reimbursement, require all individuals to have health insurance (with limited exceptions) and impose increased taxes.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Specifically, the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize health care reform in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on United States sales of most medical devices beginning in 2013.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P25_S3	The excise tax will increase our operating expenses.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Because many other parts of the 2010 health care law remain subject to implementation, the long-term impact on us is uncertain.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	The new law or any future legislation could reduce medical procedure volumes, lower reimbursement for the Company's products, and impact the demand for the Company's products or the prices at which the Company sells its products.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P26_S2	For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, which provided an increase to the United States debt limit, imposed significant cuts in federal spending over the next decade.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P26_S3	This measure and other such deficit reduction legislation could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and prospects if they were to result in cuts to, or a restructuring of, entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We do business with governments outside the United States.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	A number of these countries, including certain European countries, have experienced a deterioration in credit and economic conditions.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P27_S2	These conditions have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a reduction in the number of procedures that use our products and an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect accounts receivable outstanding in these countries.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P27_S3	In addition, we have been and may continue to be impacted by declines in sovereign credit ratings or sovereign defaults in these countries.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our business is subject to economic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations, including risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Because we sell our products in a number of countries, our business is subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including risks associated with United States government oversight and enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as well as with the United Kingdom's Bribery Act and anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Our net sales originating outside of the United States, as a percentage of total net sales, were 57% in 2012.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P29_S2	We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P29_S3	In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the United States.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	local economic and financial conditions affecting the collectability of receivables, including receivables from sovereign entities; an outbreak of any life threatening communicable disease; economic and political instability and local economic and political conditions; differing labor regulations; and differing protection of intellectual property.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Substantially all of our sales outside of the United States are denominated in local currencies.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Measured in local currency, a substantial portion of our international sales was generated in Europe (and primarily denominated in the Euro) and in Japan.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P31_S2	The United States dollar value of our international sales varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Decreases in the value of the United States dollar to the Euro or the Japanese yen have the effect of increasing our reported revenues even when the volume of international sales has remained constant.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Increases in the value of the United States dollar relative to the Euro or the Japanese yen, as well as other currencies, have the opposite effect and, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our reported revenues and results of operations.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P31_S5	We have a hedging program for certain currencies that attempts to manage currency exchange rate risks to an acceptable level based on management's judgment of the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity and cost; however, this hedging program does not completely eliminate the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act, and similar laws in other jurisdictions contain prohibitions against bribery and other illegal payments or for the failure to have procedures in place that prevent such payments.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Recent years have seen an increasing number of investigations and other enforcement activities under these laws.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Although we have compliance programs in place with respect to these laws, no assurance can be given that a violation will not be found, and if found, the resulting penalties could adversely affect us and our business.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The stock market can be volatile and fluctuations in our quarterly operating results as well as other factors could cause our stock price to decline.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	From time to time the stock market experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P34_S1	This volatility can have a significant effect on the market prices of securities for reasons unrelated to underlying performance.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P34_S2	These broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect our stock price, regardless of our operating results.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P34_S3	In addition, the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in response to any of the other risk factors set out above and below, as well as a number of other factors, including the performance of comparable companies or the medical device industry, or changes in financial estimates and recommendations of securities analysts.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P35_S1	A high proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to significant sales, research and development, and manufacturing costs.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Thus, small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter, and the price of our common stock could fall.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Other factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include:
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	the timing of regulatory approvals; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; delays or problems in introducing new products, such as slower than anticipated adoption of transcatheter heart valves; changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors; the timing of approvals of governmental reimbursement rates or changes in reimbursement rates for our products; increased expenses, whether related to sales and marketing, raw materials or supplies, product development or administration; changes in the level of economic activity in the United States or other regions in which we do business; costs related to acquisitions of technologies or businesses; and our ability to expand our operations and the amount and timing of expansion-related expenditures.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We face intense competition, and if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The cardiovascular medical device industry is highly competitive.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P38_S1	We compete with many companies, some of which have longer operating histories, better brand or name recognition, and broader product offerings.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Our customers consider many factors when selecting a product, including product reliability, breadth of product line, clinical outcomes, product availability, price, availability and rate of reimbursement, and services provided by the manufacturer.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P38_S3	In addition, our ability to compete will depend in large part on our ability to develop and acquire new products and technologies, anticipate technology advances and keep pace with other developers of cardiovascular therapies and technologies.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Our sales, technical and other key personnel play an integral role in the development, marketing and selling of new and existing products.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	If we are unable to recruit, hire, develop and retain a talented, competitive work force, our ability to compete may be adversely affected.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Our competitive position can also be adversely affected by product problems, physician advisories and safety alerts, reflecting the importance of quality in the medical device industry.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Our position can shift as a result of any of these factors.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P39_S3	See " Competition " under " Business " included herein.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The health care industry has been consolidating and organizations such as GPOs, independent delivery networks, and large single accounts such as the United States Veterans Administration, continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for many of our health care provider customers.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P41_S1	As a result, transactions with customers are larger, more complex, and tend to involve more long-term contracts.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P41_S2	The purchasing power of these larger customers has increased, and may continue to increase, causing downward pressure on product pricing.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P41_S3	If we are not one of the providers selected by one of these organizations, we may be precluded from making sales to its members or participants.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Even if we are one of the selected providers, we may be at a disadvantage relative to other selected providers that are able to offer volume discounts based on purchases of a broader range of medical equipment and supplies.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P41_S5	Further, we may be required to commit to pricing that has a material adverse effect on our revenues and profit margins, business, financial condition and results of operations.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P41_S6	We expect that market demand, governmental regulation, third-party reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide health care industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances, which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our success and competitive position are dependent in part upon our proprietary intellectual property.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We rely on a combination of patents and trade secrets to protect our proprietary intellectual property, and we expect to continue to do so.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Although we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of means, we cannot guarantee that the protective steps we have taken are adequate to protect these rights.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged and held invalid.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P44_S1	In addition, as our patents expire, we may be unsuccessful in extending their protection through patent term extensions.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P44_S2	The expiration of, or the failure to maintain or extend our patents, could have a material adverse effect on us.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We also rely on confidentiality agreements with certain employees, consultants and other third parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary information.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P45_S1	These agreements could be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for such a breach.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P45_S2	In addition, others could independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary information.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We spend significant resources to enforce our intellectual property rights, sometimes resulting in litigation.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Intellectual property litigation is complex and can be expensive and time-consuming.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P46_S2	However, our efforts in this regard may not be successful.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P46_S3	We may not be able to detect infringement.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P46_S4	In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Patent litigation can result in substantial cost and diversion of effort.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Intellectual property protection may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, enabling our competitors to capture increased market position.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P47_S2	The invalidation of key intellectual property rights or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits filed to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or prospects.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P49_S0	During recent years, we and our competitors have been involved in substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P49_S1	From time to time, we have been and may in the future be forced to defend against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, and such intellectual property litigation is typically costly and time-consuming.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Adverse determinations in any such litigation could result in significant liabilities to third parties or injunctions, or could require us to seek licenses from third parties and, if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms, prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using certain products, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on us.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P49_S3	In addition, some licenses may be non-exclusive, which could provide our competitors access to the same technologies.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Third parties could also obtain patents that may require us to either redesign products or, if possible, negotiate licenses from such third parties.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Such licenses may materially increase our expenses.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P50_S2	If we are unable to redesign products or obtain a license, we might have to exit a particular product offering.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We and our customers are subject to rigorous governmental regulations and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products that are compatible with these regulations.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P51_S1	In addition, failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial sanctions which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P52_S0	The medical devices we manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities, including regulations that cover the composition, labeling, testing, clinical study, design, sourcing, manufacturing, packaging, marketing, advertising, promotion and distribution of our products.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We are required to register with the FDA as a device manufacturer.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P54_S0	testing, design, quality control and documentation procedures.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P54_S1	The FDA may also inspect our compliance with requirements related to adverse event reporting, recalls or corrections (field actions), the conduct of clinical studies, and other requirements.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P55_S0	In the European Union, we are required to maintain certain CE Mark and ISO certifications in order to sell our products, and are subject to periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P55_S1	If we or our suppliers fail to adhere to QSR, CE Mark, ISO or similar requirements, this could delay or interrupt product production or sales and/or lead to fines, difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances, recalls or other consequences, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or prospects.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Medical devices must receive FDA clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the United States.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P56_S1	In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of approved products that have been commercialized, and can prevent or limit further marketing of a product based upon the results of post-marketing programs.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P56_S2	In addition, the federal Medical Device Reporting regulations require us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P56_S3	Federal regulations also require us to report certain recalls or corrective actions to the FDA.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P56_S4	Furthermore, most major markets for medical devices outside the United States require clearance, approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P56_S5	The process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device, particularly from the FDA and certain foreign governmental authorities, can be costly and time-consuming, and clearances or approvals may not be granted for products or product improvements on a timely basis, if at all.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P56_S6	Delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, clearances or approvals for products or product improvements could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations or prospects.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P57_S0	At any time after approval of a product for commercial sale, the FDA may conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with QSR requirements, and/or current Medical Device Reporting regulations, or other regulatory requirements.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Noncompliance with applicable requirements may subject the Company or responsible individuals to sanctions including civil money penalties, product seizure, injunction, or criminal prosecution.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P57_S2	Additionally, product approvals by the FDA can be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We are also subject to various United States and international laws pertaining to health care pricing and fraud and abuse, including prohibitions on kickbacks and the submission of false claims laws and restrictions on relationships with physicians and other referral sources.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P58_S1	These laws are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation, which could require us to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if we are found not to be in compliance.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P58_S2	Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions against the Company and our officers and employees, including substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in governmental health care programs.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Despite our implementation of robust compliance processes, we may be subject, from time to time, to inspections, investigations and other enforcement actions by governmental authorities.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P59_S1	If we are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, the applicable governmental authority can impose fines, delay, suspend, or revoke regulatory clearances or approvals, institute proceedings to detain or seize our products, issue a recall, impose marketing or operating restrictions, enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against us or our officers or employees, and institute criminal prosecution.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Moreover, governmental authorities can ban or request the recall, repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any device or product we manufacture or distribute.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Any of the foregoing actions could result in decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P59_S4	In addition to the sanctions for noncompliance described above, commencement of an enforcement proceeding, inspection or investigation could divert substantial management attention from the operation of our business and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Our industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities, which may lead to greater governmental regulation in the future.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P61_S0	In recent years, the medical device industry has been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny, including by the FDA, numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities, as well as members of Congress.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P61_S1	This has included increased regulation, enforcement, inspections, and governmental investigations of the medical device industry and disclosure of financial relationships with health care professionals.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P61_S2	We anticipate that the government will continue to scrutinize our industry closely, and that additional regulation by governmental authorities, both foreign and domestic, may increase compliance costs, exposure to litigation and other adverse effects to our operations.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Unsuccessful clinical trials or procedures relating to products under development could have a material adverse effect on our prospects.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P63_S0	The regulatory approval process for new products and new indications for existing products requires extensive clinical trials and procedures, including early clinical experiences and regulatory studies.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from current or future clinical trials or procedures conducted by us, our competitors, or third parties, or perceptions regarding this clinical data, could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary approvals and the market's view of our future prospects.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Such clinical trials and procedures are inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that these trials or procedures will be completed in a timely or cost-effective manner or result in a commercially viable product.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P63_S3	Failure to successfully complete these trials or procedures in a timely and cost-effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our prospects.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Clinical trials or procedures may experience significant setbacks even after earlier trials have shown promising results.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Further, preliminary results from clinical trials or procedures may be contradicted by subsequent clinical analysis.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P64_S2	In addition, results from our clinical trials or procedures may not be supported by actual long-term studies or clinical experience.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P64_S3	If preliminary clinical results are later contradicted, or if initial results cannot be supported by actual long-term studies or clinical experience, our business could be adversely affected.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P64_S4	Clinical trials or procedures may be suspended or terminated by us, the FDA or other regulatory authorities at any time if it is believed that the trial participants face unacceptable health risks.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Certain of our products, including pericardial tissue valves, are manufactured using bovine tissue.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Concerns relating to the potential transmission of BSE, commonly known as "mad cow disease," from cows to humans may result in reduced acceptance of products containing bovine materials.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Certain medical device regulatory agencies have considered whether to continue to permit the sale of medical devices that incorporate bovine material.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P67_S0	We obtain bovine tissue only from closely controlled sources within the United States and Australia.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P67_S1	The bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valves is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility for the suspected BSE infectious agent.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P67_S2	We have not experienced any significant adverse impact on our sales as a result of concerns regarding BSE, but no assurance can be given that such an impact may not occur in the future.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P68_S0	If third-party payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or impose other cost containment measures to reduce reimbursement levels, our ability to profitably sell our products will be harmed.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P69_S0	We sell our products and technologies to hospitals, doctors and other health care providers, all of which receive reimbursement for the health care services provided to patients from third-party payors, such as government programs (both domestic and international), private insurance plans and managed care programs.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P69_S1	The ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products from private and governmental third-party payors is critical to the success of medical technology companies.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P69_S2	The availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P69_S3	Reimbursement varies from country to country and can significantly impact acceptance of new products.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P70_S1	There can be no assurance that levels of reimbursement, if any, will not be decreased in the future, or that future legislation, regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payors will not otherwise adversely affect the demand for and price levels of our products.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P71_S0	The introduction of cost containment incentives, combined with closer scrutiny of health care expenditures by both private health insurers and employers, has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Hospitals or physicians may respond to such cost-containment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other therapies.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P71_S2	In addition, the 2010 United States health care law could adversely affect reimbursement levels for our products, or otherwise adversely affect our product pricing and profitability.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs, including price regulation, are underway in several countries around the world.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P72_S1	In many countries, customers are reimbursed for our products under a government operated insurance system.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P72_S2	Under such a system, the government periodically reviews reimbursement levels and may limit patient access.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P72_S3	If a government were to decide to reduce reimbursement levels, our product pricing could be adversely affected.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods as determined by such third-party payors, or was used for an unapproved indication.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Third-party payors may also deny reimbursement for experimental procedures and devices.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P74_S0	We believe that many of our existing products are cost-effective, even though the one-time cost may be significant, because they are intended to reduce overall health care costs over a long period of time.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P74_S1	We cannot be certain that these third-party payors will recognize these cost savings instead of merely focusing on the lower initial costs associated with competing therapies.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P74_S2	If our products are not considered cost-effective by third-party payors, our customers may not be reimbursed for them, resulting in lower sales of our products.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Use of our products in unapproved circumstances could expose us to liabilities.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P76_S0	The marketing approval from the FDA and other regulators of certain of our products are, or are expected to be, limited to specific indications.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P76_S1	We are prohibited by law from marketing or promoting any unapproved use of our products.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P76_S2	Physicians, however, can use these products in ways or circumstances other than those strictly within the scope of the regulatory approval.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P76_S3	Although the product training we provide to physicians and other health care professionals is limited to approved uses or for clinical trials, no assurance can be given that claims might not be asserted against us if our products are used in ways or for procedures that are not approved.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Our operations are subject to environmental, health and safety regulations that could result in substantial costs.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Our operations are subject to environmental, health and safety laws, and regulations concerning, among other things, the generation, handling, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes, the cleanup of hazardous substance releases, and emissions or discharges into the air or water.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P78_S1	We have incurred and may incur expenditures in the future in connection with environmental, health and safety laws, and regulations.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P78_S2	New laws and regulations, violations of these laws or regulations, stricter enforcement of existing requirements, or the discovery of previously unknown contamination could require us to incur costs or could become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could be material.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P79_S0	The success of many of our products depends upon strong relationships with certain key physicians.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P80_S0	The development, marketing and sale of many of our products requires us to maintain working relationships with physicians upon whom we rely to provide considerable knowledge and experience.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P80_S1	These physicians may assist us as researchers, marketing consultants, product trainers and consultants, inventors and as public speakers.
1099800_13_ITEM1A_P81_S0	relationships with these professionals or to continue to receive their advice and input, the development and marketing of our products could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1099800_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	The locations and uses of the major properties of Edwards Lifesciences are as follows:

1099800_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	The principal market for Edwards Lifesciences' common stock is the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE").
1099800_13_ITEM5_P0_S1	The table below sets forth, for the calendar quarters indicated, the high and low sales prices of Edwards Lifesciences' common stock as reported by the NYSE.
1099800_13_ITEM5_P1_S0	On January 31, 2013 there were 17,086 stockholders of record of Edwards Lifesciences' common stock.
1099800_13_ITEM5_P2_S0	Edwards Lifesciences has never paid any cash dividends on its capital stock and has no current plans to pay any cash dividends.
1099800_13_ITEM5_P3_S0	The current policy of Edwards Lifesciences is to retain any future earnings for use in the business of the Company.
1099800_13_ITEM5_P4_S0	On September 13, 2011, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions up to $500.0 million of the Company's common stock.
1099800_13_ITEM5_P4_S1	In November 2012, the Company paid $100.0 million under its November accelerated share repurchase ("ASR") agreement and received an initial delivery of 1.1 million shares of the Company's common stock at $85.73 per share, representing approximately 90 percent of the total contract value.
1099800_13_ITEM5_P4_S2	In February 2013, the November ASR concluded, and the Company received an additional 0.1 million shares.
1099800_13_ITEM5_P5_S0	Shares purchased pursuant to the ASR agreement are presented in the above table in the periods in which they are received.
1099800_13_ITEM5_P5_S1	The amount that may yet be purchased under the stock repurchase program, as presented in the above table, was reduced by the $100.0 million payment.
1099800_13_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following table sets forth selected financial information with respect to Edwards Lifesciences.
1099800_13_ITEM6_P0_S1	The information set forth below should be read in conjunction with Edwards Lifesciences' "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Consolidated Financial Statements" found elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

1099800_13_ITEM6_P1_S1	(b) The Company's Five-Year Unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement ("the Credit Agreement") matured on September 29, 2011.
1099800_13_ITEM6_P1_S2	At December 31, 2010, all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement were classified as short-term obligations as these obligations were due within one year.
1099800_13_ITEM6_P2_S0	In July 2011, the Company entered into a new Four-Year Credit Agreement ("the Credit Facility").
1099800_13_ITEM6_P2_S1	All amounts outstanding under the new Credit Facility have been classified as long-term as the obligations are expected to be refinanced on a long-term basis under the Credit Facility.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis presents the factors that had a material effect on the results of operations of Edwards Lifesciences during the three years ended December 31, 2012.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P0_S1	Also discussed is Edwards Lifesciences' financial position as of December 31, 2012.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P0_S2	You should read this discussion in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	Edwards Lifesciences Corporation is focused on technologies that treat structural heart disease and critically ill patients.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	A pioneer in the development and commercialization of heart valve products, Edwards Lifesciences is the world's leading manufacturer of tissue heart valves and repair products used to replace or repair a patient's diseased or defective heart valve.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P1_S2	The Company is also a global leader in hemodynamic monitoring systems used to measure a patient's cardiovascular function in the hospital setting.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	During the first quarter of 2012, the Company began reporting its products and technologies in three new product groups: Surgical Heart Valve Therapy, which combines surgical heart valves and Cardiac Surgery Systems; Transcatheter Heart Valves; and Critical Care, which includes Vascular.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	Sales amounts for the prior year periods have been recast to conform with the new product classifications.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Edwards Lifesciences' Surgical Heart Valve Therapy portfolio is comprised primarily of tissue heart valves and heart valve repair products for the surgical replacement or repair of a patient's heart valve.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	The portfolio also includes a diverse line of products used during minimally invasive surgical procedures, and cannulae, embolic protection devices and other products used during cardiopulmonary bypass.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	The Company's Transcatheter Heart Valves portfolio includes technologies designed to treat heart valve disease using catheter-based approaches as opposed to open surgical techniques.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	In the Critical Care portfolio, Edwards Lifesciences' products include pulmonary artery catheters, disposable pressure transducers and advanced monitoring systems.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P4_S2	The portfolio also includes a line of balloon catheter-based vascular products, surgical clips and inserts.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	The health care marketplace continues to be competitive with strong global and local competitors.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	The Company competes with many companies, ranging from small start-up enterprises to companies that are larger with broader product offerings than Edwards Lifesciences.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P5_S2	Furthermore, rapid product development and technological change characterize the market in which the Company competes.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	Global demand for health care is increasing as the population ages.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	There is mounting pressure to contain health care costs in the face of this increasing demand, which has resulted in pricing and market share pressures.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P6_S2	The cardiovascular segment of the medical device industry is dynamic, and technology, cost-of-care considerations, regulatory reform, industry and customer consolidation, and evolving patient needs are expected to continue to drive change.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	In 2010, significant reforms to the health care system were adopted as law in the United States.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	The law includes provisions that, among other things, reduce or limit Medicare reimbursement, require all individuals to have health insurance (with limited exceptions) and impose increased taxes.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P7_S2	Specifically, the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize health care reform in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on United States sales of most medical devices beginning in 2013.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P7_S3	The excise tax will increase the Company's operating expenses.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	Because many other parts of the 2010 health care law remain subject to implementation, the long-term impact on the Company is uncertain.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	The new law or any future legislation could reduce medical procedure volumes, lower reimbursement for the Company's products, and impact the demand for the Company's products or the prices at which the Company sells its products.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	The $206.5 million increase in net sales in the United States in 2012 was due primarily to:
1099800_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	Transcatheter Heart Valves, which increased net sales by $203.5 million, driven primarily by sales of the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve which was launched in the fourth quarter of 2011.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	The $14.5 million increase in international net sales in 2012 was due primarily to:
1099800_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $42.4 million, due primarily to the weakening of the Euro against the United States dollar.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	The $38.0 million increase in net sales in the United States in 2011 was due primarily to:
1099800_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	Transcatheter Heart Valves, which increased net sales by $23.5 million, driven primarily by sales of the Edwards SAPIEN and SAPIEN XT transcatheter heart valves for clinical trials and commercial sales resulting from the launch in the fourth quarter of 2011; Critical Care products, which increased net sales by $9.3 million, driven primarily by the FloTrac minimally invasive monitoring system and pressure monitoring products.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	Surgical Heart Valve Therapy products, which increased net sales by $5.1 million, driven primarily by the Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna Aortic Ease and Magna Mitral Ease valves (launched in the third quarter of 2010).
1099800_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	The $193.6 million increase in international net sales in 2011 was due primarily to:
1099800_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	Transcatheter Heart Valves, which increased net sales by $88.2 million, driven primarily by sales of the Edwards SAPIEN XT transcatheter heart valve; Surgical Heart Valve Therapy products, which increased net sales by $20.2 million, driven primarily by the Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna Aortic Ease valve; Critical Care products, which increased net sales by $18.6 million, driven primarily by pressure monitoring products and the FloTrac minimally invasive monitoring system; and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which increased net sales by $58.0 million, due to the strengthening of various currencies against the United States dollar, primarily the Euro and the Japanese yen.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net sales is not necessarily indicative of the impact on net income due to the corresponding effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on international manufacturing and operating costs and the Company's hedging activities.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	The $3.1 million increase in net sales of Surgical Heart Valve Therapy products in 2012 was primarily due to:
1099800_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $15.3 million, primarily due to the weakening of the Euro against the United States dollar.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	The $52.3 million increase in net sales of Surgical Heart Valve Therapy products in 2011 was primarily due to:
1099800_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	surgical heart valve products, which increased net sales by $21.1 million, driven by sales of the Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna Aortic Ease and Magna Mitral Ease valves; and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which increased net sales by $25.4 million, primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro and the Japanese yen against the United States dollar.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	In Europe, the Company received CE Mark in February 2012 for EDWARDS INTUITY , its minimally invasive aortic valve surgery system.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	During the second quarter of 2012, the Company received conditional Investigational Device Exemption ("IDE") approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") to initiate the TRANSFORM Trial, which will evaluate the EDWARDS INTUITY valve system, and began enrollment in the third quarter of 2012.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P22_S2	Also, during the second quarter of 2012, the Company received IDE approval to initiate a clinical trial, called COMMENCE, to study its GLX next-generation tissue treatment platform applied to the Magna Ease aortic surgical valve, and in the fourth quarter of 2012 received approval to include the Magna Mitral Ease valve in the study.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	During the second quarter of 2012, the Company received regulatory approval in the United States and Europe for its ProPlege retrograde cardioplegia device, designed to protect the heart during aortic and mitral valve procedures.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	The Company initiated a limited launch of ProPlege in Europe in June 2012 and in the United States in July 2012.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	The $218.3 million increase in net sales of Transcatheter Heart Valves in 2012 was primarily due to:
1099800_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $16.7 million, primarily due to the weakening of the Euro against the United States dollar.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	The $127.4 million increase in net sales of Transcatheter Heart Valves in 2011 was primarily due to:
1099800_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	decreased international sales of the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve due to the adoption of the SAPIEN XT valve.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	The Company expects that sales of its transcatheter heart valves will continue to grow during 2013.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	In November 2011, the Company received approval from the FDA for the transfemoral delivery of the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve for treatment of certain inoperable patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (Cohort B of The PARTNER Trial).
1099800_13_ITEM7_P29_S1	In October 2012, the Company received approval from the FDA for the transfemoral and transapical delivery of the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve for treatment of patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis deemed at high risk for traditional open-heart surgery (Cohort A of The PARTNER Trial).
1099800_13_ITEM7_P29_S2	The Company is continuing to conduct the PARTNER II Trial, which is evaluating the Edwards SAPIEN XT transcatheter heart valve for the United States market.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P29_S3	In September 2012, the Company received FDA approval to add to the trial its larger 29 millimeter SAPIEN XT valve with the NovaFlex+ delivery system and the Ascendra+ delivery system for both the transapical and new transaortic approach.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P29_S4	In early 2013, the Company began enrollment in the CE Mark trial for its SAPIEN 3 valve, designed to reduce paravalvular leak.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	The $0.4 million decrease in net sales of Critical Care products in 2012 was primarily due to:
1099800_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	advanced monitoring products, which increased net sales by $16.7 million, driven by FloTrac systems.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	The $51.9 million increase in net sales of Critical Care products in 2011 was primarily due to:
1099800_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	pressure monitoring products, which increased net sales by $15.4 million; advanced monitoring products, led by FloTrac systems, which increased net sales by $13.1 million, and the EV1000 Clinical Platform , which increased net sales by $5.7 million; and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which increased net sales by $21.6 million, primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro and Japanese yen against the United States dollar.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	The 3.2 percentage point increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2012 was driven by:
1099800_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	the voluntary recalls in the second quarter of 2012 of certain of the Company's heart valves and Critical Care catheters, and manufacturing inefficiencies.

1099800_13_ITEM7_P61_S1	While the Company has accrued for matters it believes are more likely than not to require settlement, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P61_S2	Furthermore, the Company may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise its right to appeal.

1099800_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	The federal research credit expired on December 31, 2011 and was retroactively reinstated on January 2, 2013.

1099800_13_ITEM7_P70_S3	However, no assurances can be given that such long-term capital will be available to the Company on favorable terms, or at all.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	The Company believes that cash held in the United States, in addition to amounts available under credit facilities and cash from operations, are sufficient to fund its United States operating requirements.

1099800_13_ITEM7_P71_S4	The potential tax liability related to any repatriation would be dependent on the facts and circumstances that would exist at the time such repatriation is made and the complexities of the tax laws of the United States and the respective foreign jurisdictions.

1099800_13_ITEM7_P80_S0	Net cash flows provided by operating activities of $373.8 million for 2012 increased $59.3 million from 2011 due primarily to (1) improved operating performance, (2) a decrease in inventory builds in comparison to the prior year and (3) increased collection of accounts receivable, particularly a $26.3 million non-recurring collection in Spain and the sale of the Company's Greek bonds.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P80_S1	These increases were partially offset by (1) a $50.5 million impact from increased excess tax benefits from stock plans, primarily the realization of excess tax benefits that had been previously unrealized due to credit carryforwards and net operating losses in the United States, and (2) the timing of supplier payments.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P81_S0	Net cash flows provided by operating activities of $314.5 million for 2011 increased $63.1 million from 2010 due primarily to higher operating profits and a $49.1 million positive impact from decreased excess tax benefits from stock plans due to credit carryforwards and net operating losses in the United States in 2011 resulting in excess tax benefits that were not realized.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P81_S1	This increase was partially offset by higher working capital needs (primarily inventory and accounts receivables).

1099800_13_ITEM7_P87_S0	The amount included in "Less Than 1 Year" reflects anticipated contributions to the Company's various pension plans.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P87_S1	Anticipated contributions beyond one year are not determinable.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P87_S2	The total accrued benefit liability for the Company's pension plans recognized as of December 31, 2012 was $50.8 million.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P87_S3	This amount is impacted by, among other items, pension expense funding levels, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and investment return on plan assets.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P87_S4	Therefore, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid, and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P87_S5	See Note 11 to the " Consolidated Financial Statements " for further information.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P88_S0	(b) Contractual development obligations consist primarily of cash that the Company is obligated to pay upon achievement of product development and other milestones.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P88_S1	(c) Capital commitment obligations consist primarily of cash that the Company is obligated to pay to its limited partnership and limited liability corporation investees.

1099800_13_ITEM7_P89_S0	As a result of on-going negotiations of an Advanced Pricing Agreement between Switzerland and the United States, the expiration of statutes of limitations, and the possible settlement of on-going audits in several jurisdictions for multiple years throughout the world, the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P89_S1	The range of such change could vary, but the amount of such change is not expected to be material.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P89_S2	The Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid, and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table.

1099800_13_ITEM7_P90_S1	Certain of the Company's accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ("GAAP").
1099800_13_ITEM7_P90_S2	In evaluating the Company's transactions, management assesses all relevant GAAP and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P91_S0	The application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P91_S1	These matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain, and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P91_S2	Management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements, using historical experience and all available information.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P91_S3	The Company also uses outside experts where appropriate.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P92_S0	The Company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P93_S0	The Company believes the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on the Company's reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P94_S0	The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P95_S0	Revenue is considered realized or realizable and earned upon delivery of the product, provided that an agreement of sale exists, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P95_S1	In the case of certain products where the Company maintains consigned inventory at customer locations, revenue is recognized at the time the Company is notified that the customer has used the inventory.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P96_S0	The Company's sales terms are standard terms within the medical device industry, with title and risk of loss transferring upon delivery to the customer, limited right of return and no unusual provisions or conditions.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P96_S1	When the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products, an estimate of various sales returns and allowances is recorded which reduces product sales and accounts receivable.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P96_S2	These adjustments include estimates for rebates, returns and other sales allowances.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P96_S3	These provisions are estimated and recorded at the time of sale based upon historical payment experience, historical relationship to revenues, estimated customer inventory levels, and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P96_S4	Product returns are not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P96_S5	If the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not approximate future activity, the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be impacted.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P97_S0	The Company's primary sales adjustment relates to distributor rebates which are given to the Company's United States distributors and represents the difference between the Company's sales price to the distributor (at the Company's distributor "list price") and the negotiated price to be paid by the end-customer.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P97_S1	This distributor rebate is recorded by the Company as a reduction to sales and a reduction to the distributor's accounts receivable at the time of sale to a distributor.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P97_S2	The Company validates the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from its distributors or an estimate of its distributor's inventory.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P97_S3	This distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P97_S4	The Company periodically monitors current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the credit for future distributor rebates is fairly stated.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P98_S0	The Company also offers volume rebates to certain GPOs and customers based upon target sales levels.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P98_S1	For volume rebates offered to GPOs, the rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and an obligation to the GPO, as the Company expects to pay in cash.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P99_S0	The provision for volume rebates is estimated based on customers' contracted rebate programs and historical experience of rebates paid.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P99_S1	The Company periodically monitors its customer rebate programs to ensure that the allowance and liability for accrued rebates is fairly stated.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P100_S0	The Company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer-specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P101_S0	The credit and economic conditions within Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece, among other members of the European Union, have deteriorated as these countries have experienced slower economic growth and higher debt levels.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P101_S1	When evaluating its allowances for doubtful accounts related to these European receivables, the Company's analysis considers a number of factors including evidence of the customer's ability to comply with credit terms, economic conditions and procedures implemented by the Company to collect the historical receivables.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P101_S2	Additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances, if economic conditions are less favorable than the Company has anticipated, or for customer-specific circumstances, such as financial difficulty.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P101_S3	The allowance for doubtful accounts was $12.0 million and $19.0 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P102_S0	The Company records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P102_S1	Additional inventory allowances may be required if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the Company has estimated.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P103_S0	A write-down for excess or inactive inventory is recorded for inventory which is obsolete, nearing its expiration date (generally triggered at six months prior to expiration), is damaged or slow moving (generally defined as quantities in excess of a two year supply).
1099800_13_ITEM7_P103_S1	The allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was $16.3 million and $12.9 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P104_S0	The Company expenses legal costs incurred for patent preparation and applications.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P104_S1	The Company capitalizes certain legal costs related to the defense and enforcement of issued patents and trademarks for which success is deemed probable.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P104_S2	These capitalized legal costs are amortized over the life of the related patent or trademark.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P104_S3	Such legal costs are periodically reviewed for impairment and recoverability.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P105_S0	The Company acquires intangible assets in connection with business combinations and asset purchases.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P105_S1	The acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value, which is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P105_S2	The determination of fair value requires significant estimates, including, but not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate used to discount those cash flows, the assessment of the asset's life cycle, including the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects, and the consideration of legal, technical, regulatory, economic, and competitive risks.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P106_S0	Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development acquired in business combinations, are reviewed for impairment annually, or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P106_S1	Additionally, management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and long-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P106_S2	The impairment reviews require significant estimates about fair value, including estimation of future cash flows, selection of an appropriate discount rate, and estimates of long-term growth rates.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P107_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P107_S1	The Company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and adjusting the amount, if necessary.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P107_S2	The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are both historical experience and the Company's forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P107_S3	Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the Company's effective tax rate on future earnings.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P108_S0	When assessing whether a windfall tax benefit relating to stock-based compensation has been realized, the Company follows the with and without approach, under which the windfall benefit is recognized only if an incremental benefit is provided after considering all other tax attributes presently available to the Company.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P108_S1	Consideration is given only to the direct impacts of stock awards when calculating the amount of windfalls and shortfalls.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P109_S0	The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P109_S1	Significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company's uncertain tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P109_S2	The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that a position would more likely than not be sustained based upon its technical merit if challenged by the relevant taxing authority and taken by management to the court of last resort.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P109_S3	For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the relevant tax authority.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P110_S0	The Company strives to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P110_S1	While the Company has accrued for matters it believes are more likely than not to require settlement, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P110_S2	Furthermore, the Company may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise its right to appeal.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P110_S3	The uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation, regulations or case law.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P110_S4	Management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from these uncertain tax positions.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P111_S0	As a result of on-going negotiations of an Advanced Pricing Agreement, the expiration of statutes of limitations, and the possible settlement of on-going audits in several jurisdictions for multiple years throughout the world, the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P111_S1	The range of such change could vary, but the amount of such change is not expected to be material.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P112_S0	The Company has $38.4 million of California research expenditure tax credits it expects to use in future periods.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P112_S1	The credits may be carried forward indefinitely.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P112_S2	Based upon anticipated future taxable income, the Company expects that it is more likely than not that all California research expenditure tax credits will be utilized, although the utilization of the full benefit is expected to occur over a number of years and into the far distant future.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P112_S3	Accordingly, no valuation allowance has been provided.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P113_S0	The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based awards based on estimated fair values.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P113_S1	Stock-based awards consist of stock options, restricted stock units, market-based restricted stock units and employee stock purchase subscriptions.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P114_S0	The fair value of market-based restricted stock units is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which uses multiple input variables to determine the probability of satisfying the market condition requirements.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P114_S1	The Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo models require various highly judgmental assumptions, including stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected option term.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P114_S2	Stock-based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P114_S3	Judgment is required in estimating the stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P114_S4	If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and the Company's results of operations could be impacted.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P115_S0	In December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an amendment to the accounting guidance on disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P115_S1	The guidance requires an entity to disclose both gross and net information about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are eligible for offset in the consolidated balance sheet or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P115_S2	In January 2013, the FASB clarified that this guidance applies only to derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse purchase agreements, and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either offset in accordance with specific criteria contained in the accounting guidance or subject to a master netting arrangement or similar agreement.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P115_S3	The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P115_S4	The Company will provide the information required by this guidance in 2013.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P116_S0	In July 2012, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting guidance on intangible assets to permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to calculate the fair value of the indefinite-lived asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P116_S1	The guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P116_S2	The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P117_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting guidance on reporting amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P117_S1	The guidance requires an entity to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income if the amount being reclassed is required under United States GAAP to be reclassified in its entirety to net income.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P117_S2	For other amounts that are not required under United States GAAP to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures required under United States GAAP that provide additional detail about those amounts.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P117_S3	The guidance is effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012, and interim periods within those annual periods.
1099800_13_ITEM7_P117_S4	The Company will provide the information required by this guidance in 2013.
1099800_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The Company's business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets, including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates.
1099800_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The Company manages these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments.
1099800_13_ITEM7A_P0_S2	The Company uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts and option-based products to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates.
1099800_13_ITEM7A_P0_S3	The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1099800_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	In addition to available cash and cash from operations, the Company uses debt to finance business activities.
1099800_13_ITEM7A_P1_S1	The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its debt obligations.
1099800_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	A hypothetical 10% increase in the Company's weighted-average interest rate would have an immaterial effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.
1099800_13_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The Company is exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations.
1099800_13_ITEM7A_P3_S1	These risks include the translation of local currency balances and results of the Company's non-United States subsidiaries into United States dollars, currency gains and losses related to intercompany and third-party transactions denominated in currencies other than a location's functional currency, and currency gains and losses associated with intercompany loans.
1099800_13_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The Company's principal currency exposures relate to the Euro and the Japanese yen.
1099800_13_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The Company's objective is to minimize the volatility of its exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and the use of derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options contracts.
1099800_13_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The Company does not hedge its exposure related to its net investments in its non-United States subsidiaries.
1099800_13_ITEM7A_P4_S3	The total notional amounts of the Company's derivative financial instruments entered into for foreign currency management purposes at December 31, 2012 and 2011 were $779.0 million and $759.5 million, respectively.
1099800_13_ITEM7A_P4_S4	A hypothetical 10% increase/decrease in the value of the United States dollar against all hedged currencies would increase/decrease the fair value of these derivative contracts by $55.0 million and $58.9 million, respectively.
1099800_13_ITEM7A_P4_S5	Any gains or losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions and would not be significant to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.
1099800_13_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Derivative financial instruments involve credit risk in the event the financial institution counterparty should default.
1099800_13_ITEM7A_P5_S1	It is the Company's policy to execute such instruments with major financial institutions that the Company believes to be creditworthy.
1099800_13_ITEM7A_P5_S2	At December 31, 2012, all derivative financial instruments were with bank counterparties assigned investment grade ratings of "A" or better by national rating agencies.
1099800_13_ITEM7A_P5_S3	The Company further diversifies its derivative financial instruments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.
1099800_13_ITEM7A_P5_S4	The Company has not experienced a counterparty default and does not anticipate any non-performance by the Company's current derivative counterparties.
1099800_13_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The Company invests excess cash in bank time deposits and diversifies the concentration of cash amongst different financial institutions.
1099800_13_ITEM7A_P7_S0	In the normal course of business, Edwards Lifesciences provides credit to customers in the health care industry, performs credit evaluations of these customers and maintains allowances for potential credit losses which have historically been adequate compared to actual losses.
1099800_13_ITEM7A_P8_S0	In 2012, the Company had no customers that represent 10% or more of its total net sales or accounts receivable, net.
1099800_13_ITEM7A_P9_S0	The Company continues to do business with foreign governments in certain European countries that have experienced a deterioration in credit and economic conditions.
1099800_13_ITEM7A_P9_S1	These conditions have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a reduction in value and an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect accounts receivable outstanding in these countries.
1099800_13_ITEM7A_P9_S2	In addition, the Company may also be impacted by declines in sovereign credit ratings or sovereign defaults in these countries.
1099800_13_ITEM7A_P10_S0	During 2011, the Company recorded a $12.8 million charge to reflect the increased risk associated with its Southern European receivables, primarily Greece.
1099800_13_ITEM7A_P10_S1	A significant further decline in sovereign credit ratings or a debt default in Greece, or in other European countries, may decrease the likelihood that the Company will collect these accounts receivable, which could result in a negative impact to the Company's operating results.
1099800_13_ITEM7A_P10_S2	As of December 31, 2012, the Company's accounts receivables, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, from customers in Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece were $104.7 million.
1099800_13_ITEM7A_P11_S0	Edwards Lifesciences is exposed to investment risks related to changes in the fair values of its investments.
1099800_13_ITEM7A_P11_S1	The Company invests in equity instruments of public and private companies.
1099800_13_ITEM7A_P11_S2	These investments are classified in " Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates " on the consolidated balance sheets.
1099800_13_ITEM7A_P12_S0	As of December 31, 2012, Edwards Lifesciences had $21.1 million of investments in equity instruments of other companies and had recorded unrealized gains of $1.4 million on these investments in " Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss ," net of tax.
1099800_13_ITEM7A_P12_S1	Should these companies experience a decline in financial condition or fail to meet certain development milestones, the decline in the investments' values may be considered other than temporary and impairment charges may be necessary.
1099800_13_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
1099800_13_ITEM9A_P0_S1	The Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of December 31, 2012.
1099800_13_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Based on their evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded as of December 31, 2012 that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1099800_13_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1099800_13_ITEM9A_P2_S1	The Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
1099800_13_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1099800_13_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Based on that evaluation, the Company's management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2012.
1099800_13_ITEM9A_P3_S2	The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.
1099800_13_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1099800_13_ITEM9A_P4_S1	There have been no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the Company's fourth fiscal quarter of 2012 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

1099800_13_ITEM15_P920_S0	In connection with the Annual Report of Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (the "Company") on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof (the "Report"), we, Michael A. Mussallem, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and Thomas M.

1099800_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	For the Years Ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011:
1099800_14_ITEM8_P1_S0	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Edwards Lifesciences Corporation:
1099800_14_ITEM8_P2_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Edwards Lifesciences Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P2_S1	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1099800_14_ITEM8_P2_S2	The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting under Item 9A.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P2_S3	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P2_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1099800_14_ITEM8_P2_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P2_S6	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P2_S7	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P2_S8	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P2_S9	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P3_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P3_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P4_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P4_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1099800_14_ITEM8_P10_S0	Edwards Lifesciences Corporation ("Edwards Lifesciences" or the "Company") conducts operations worldwide and is managed in the following geographical regions: United States, Europe, Japan and Rest of World.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P10_S1	Edwards Lifesciences is focused on technologies that treat structural heart disease and critically ill patients.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P10_S2	A pioneer in the development and commercialization of heart valve products, Edwards Lifesciences is the world's leading manufacturer of heart valves and repair products used to replace or repair a patient's diseased or defective heart valve.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P10_S3	The Company is also a global leader in hemodynamic monitoring systems used to measure a patient's cardiovascular function in the hospital setting.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P11_S0	The products and technologies provided by Edwards Lifesciences to treat advanced cardiovascular disease or critically ill patients are categorized into the following main areas:
1099800_14_ITEM8_P11_S1	Surgical Heart Valve Therapy, Transcatheter Heart Valves, and Critical Care.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P11_S2	The Company's Surgical Heart Valve Therapy portfolio includes tissue heart valves and heart valve repair products for the surgical replacement or repair of a patient's heart valve.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P11_S3	The portfolio also includes a diverse line of cardiac surgery systems used during minimally invasive surgical procedures, and cannulae, embolic protection devices and other products used during cardiopulmonary bypass.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P12_S0	The Company's Transcatheter Heart Valves portfolio includes technologies designed to treat heart valve disease using catheter-based approaches as opposed to open surgical techniques.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P12_S1	In the Critical Care portfolio, Edwards Lifesciences' products include pulmonary artery catheters, disposable pressure transducers and advanced monitoring systems.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P12_S2	The portfolio also includes a line of balloon catheter-based vascular products, surgical clips and inserts.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P13_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Edwards Lifesciences and its majority-owned subsidiaries.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P13_S1	All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P14_S0	In preparing the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company determined that it had misclassified certain accrued capital expenditures in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P14_S1	The Company has evaluated and concluded that this did not result in a material misstatement of the Company's previously issued consolidated financial statements.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P14_S2	However, the Company has elected to revise its consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 to correct the presentation of accrued capital expenditures, resulting in a decrease to net cash used in investing activities (with a corresponding decrease to net cash provided by operating activities) of $11.7 million and $6.3 million, respectively.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P15_S0	The consolidated financial statements of Edwards Lifesciences have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") which have been applied consistently in all material respects.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P15_S1	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P15_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P16_S0	When the local currency of the Company's foreign entities is the functional currency, all assets and liabilities are translated into United States dollars at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P16_S1	Income and expense items are translated at the weighted-average exchange rate prevailing during the period.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P17_S0	The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P18_S0	Revenue is considered realized or realizable and earned upon delivery of the product, provided that an agreement of sale exists, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P18_S1	In the case of certain products where the Company maintains consigned inventory at customer locations, revenue is recognized at the time the Company is notified that the customer has used the inventory.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P19_S0	The Company's principal sales terms provide for title and risk of loss transferring upon delivery to the customer, limited right of return and no unusual provisions or conditions.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P19_S1	When the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products, an estimate of various sales returns and allowances is recorded which reduces product sales and accounts receivable.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P19_S2	These adjustments include estimates for rebates, returns and other sales allowances.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P19_S3	These provisions are estimated and recorded at the time of sale based upon historical payment experience, historical relationship to revenues, estimated customer inventory levels, and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P19_S4	Other than in limited circumstances, product returns are not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P19_S5	In addition, the Company may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P19_S6	For these transactions, the Company defers recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount of product to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P20_S0	The Company's primary sales adjustment relates to distributor rebates which are given to the Company's United States distributors and represents the difference between the Company's sales price to the distributor (at the Company's distributor "list price") and the negotiated price to be paid by the end-customer.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P20_S1	This distributor rebate is recorded by the Company as a reduction to sales and a reduction to the distributor's accounts receivable at the time of sale to a distributor.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P20_S2	The Company validates the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from its distributors or an estimate of its distributor's inventory.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P20_S3	This distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P20_S4	The Company periodically monitors current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the credit for future distributor rebates is fairly stated.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P21_S0	The Company also offers volume rebates to certain group purchasing organizations ("GPOs") and customers based upon target sales levels.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P21_S1	For volume rebates offered to GPOs, the rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and an obligation to the GPO, as the Company expects to pay in cash.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P21_S2	For volume rebates offered to customers, the rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and accounts receivable, as the Company expects a net payment from the customer.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P22_S0	contracted rebate programs and historical experience of rebates paid.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P22_S1	The Company periodically monitors its customer rebate programs to ensure that the allowance and liability for accrued rebates is fairly stated.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P23_S0	The Company considers highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P23_S1	These investments are valued at cost, which approximates fair value.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P24_S0	Short-term investments include bank time deposits with original maturities between three months and one year.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P24_S1	Bank time deposits with original maturities of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P24_S2	Investments in bank time deposits are classified as held-to-maturity, as management has both the intent and ability to hold these investments to maturity, and are reported at cost, which approximates fair value.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P25_S0	The Company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer-specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P25_S1	When evaluating its allowances for doubtful accounts related to receivables from customers in certain European countries that have historically paid beyond the stated terms, the Company's analysis considers a number of factors including evidence of the customer's ability to comply with credit terms, economic conditions and procedures implemented by the Company to collect the historical receivables.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P25_S2	Additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances, if economic conditions are less favorable than the Company has anticipated, or for customer-specific circumstances, such as financial difficulty.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P25_S3	The allowance for doubtful accounts was $12.2 million and $12.0 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P26_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market value.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P26_S1	Market value for raw materials is based on replacement costs, and for other inventory classifications is based on net realizable value.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P27_S0	A write-down for excess or inactive inventory is recorded for inventory which is obsolete, nearing its expiration date (generally triggered at six months prior to expiration), is damaged or slow moving (generally defined as quantities in excess of a two year supply).
1099800_14_ITEM8_P27_S1	The allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was $29.6 million and $16.3 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P28_S0	The Company allocates to inventory general and administrative costs that are related to the production process.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P28_S1	These costs include insurance, manufacturing accounting personnel, human resources personnel and information technology.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P28_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company allocated $24.7 million, $26.2 million and $25.3 million, respectively, of general and administrative costs to inventory.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P28_S3	General and administrative costs included in inventory at December 31, 2013 and 2012 were $14.3 million and $15.1 million, respectively.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P29_S0	Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P29_S1	Depreciation is principally calculated for financial reporting purposes on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from 10 to 40 years for buildings and improvements, from 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment, and from 3 to 10 years for software.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P29_S2	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the related facility leases or the asset, whichever is shorter.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P29_S3	Straight-line and accelerated methods of depreciation are used for income tax purposes.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P30_S0	Depreciation expense for property, plant and equipment was $53.1 million, $44.0 million and $44.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P30_S1	Repairs and maintenance expense was $21.7 million, $20.6 million and $18.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P31_S0	Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P32_S0	The Company identifies its reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities, including existing goodwill, to those reporting units.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P32_S1	The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based on the Company's market capitalization and a market revenue multiple.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P32_S2	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, then the Company measures the amount of the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P32_S3	In 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company did not record any impairment loss as the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its respective carrying value.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P33_S0	Indefinite-lived intangible assets relate to in-process research and development ("IPR D") acquired in business combinations.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P33_S1	The estimated fair values of IPR D projects acquired in a business combination which have not reached technological feasibility are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P33_S2	Upon successful completion of the project, the capitalized amount is amortized over its estimated useful life.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P33_S3	If the project is abandoned, all remaining capitalized amounts are written off immediately.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P34_S0	Indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually, or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P34_S1	An impairment loss is recognized when the asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P35_S0	IPR D projects acquired in an asset acquisition are expensed unless the project has an alternative future use.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P36_S0	Management reviews the carrying amounts of other finite-lived intangible assets and long-lived tangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P36_S1	Impairment indicators include, among other conditions, cash flow deficits, historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit, and adverse legal or regulatory developments.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P37_S0	such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable, based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization periods, their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P38_S0	Estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P38_S1	For the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment, long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Company expenses legal costs incurred for patent preparation and applications.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P39_S1	The Company capitalizes certain legal costs related to the defense and enforcement of issued patents for which success is deemed probable.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P39_S2	These capitalized legal costs are amortized over the life of the related patent.

1099800_14_ITEM8_P40_S0	Investments in unconsolidated affiliates are long-term equity investments in companies that are in various stages of development.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P40_S1	Certain of these investments are designated as available-for-sale.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P40_S2	Gains or losses on investments sold are based on the specific identification method.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P40_S3	Other investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for under the cost or the equity method of accounting, as appropriate.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P41_S0	The Company accounts for investments in limited partnerships or limited liability corporations, whereby the Company owns a minimum of 5% of the investee's outstanding voting stock, under the equity method of accounting.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P41_S1	These investments are recorded at the amount of the Company's investment and adjusted each period for the Company's share of the investee's income or loss and dividends paid.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P41_S2	As investments accounted for under the cost method do not have readily determinable fair values, the Company only estimates fair value if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that could have a significant adverse effect on the investment's fair value.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P42_S0	When the fair value of an available-for-sale investment declines below cost, management uses the following criteria to determine if such a decline should be considered other-than-temporary and result in a recognized loss:
1099800_14_ITEM8_P43_S0	the duration and extent to which the market value has been less than cost; the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee; the reasons for the decline in market value; the investee's performance against product development milestones; and the Company's ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P44_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns.

1099800_14_ITEM8_P45_S1	Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the Company's effective tax rate on future earnings.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P46_S0	When assessing whether a windfall tax benefit relating to stock-based compensation has been realized, the Company follows the with and without approach, under which the windfall benefit is recognized only if an incremental benefit is provided after considering all other tax attributes presently available to the Company.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P46_S1	Consideration is given only to the direct impacts of stock awards when calculating the amount of windfalls and shortfalls.

1099800_14_ITEM8_P50_S2	Diluted shares outstanding include the dilutive effect of restricted stock units, market-based restricted stock units and in-the-money options.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P51_S0	The dilutive impact of the restricted stock units, market-based restricted stock units and in-the-money options is calculated based on the average share price for each fiscal period using the treasury stock method.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P51_S1	Under the treasury stock method, the amount that the employee must pay for exercising stock options, the amount of compensation expense for future service that the Company has not yet recognized, and the amount of tax benefits that would be recorded in " Additional Paid-in Capital " when the award becomes deductible are assumed to be used to repurchase shares.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P51_S2	Potential common share equivalents have been excluded where their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P52_S0	The table below presents the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (in millions, except for per share information):
1099800_14_ITEM8_P53_S0	Stock options, restricted stock units and market-based restricted stock units to purchase approximately 3.3 million, 1.7 million and 1.0 million shares for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, were outstanding, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.

1099800_14_ITEM8_P54_S1	Stock-based awards consist of stock options, restricted stock units, market-based restricted stock units, and employee stock purchase subscriptions.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P54_S2	Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period (vesting period) on a straight-line basis.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P54_S3	Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

1099800_14_ITEM8_P58_S0	For market-based restricted stock units, upon retirement and in certain other specified cases, a participant will receive a pro-rated portion of the shares that would ultimately be issued based on attainment of the performance goals as determined on the vesting date.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P58_S1	The pro-rated portion is based on the participant's whole months of service with the Company during the performance period prior to the date of termination.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P59_S0	The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate and foreign currency risks.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P59_S1	It is the Company's policy not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P60_S0	The Company uses interest rate swaps to convert a portion of its fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P60_S1	These interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges and meet the shortcut method requirements under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P60_S2	Accordingly, changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P60_S3	The Company uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the changes due to currency rate movements in the amount of future cash flows associated with intercompany transactions and certain third-party expenses expected to occur within the next 13 months.

1099800_14_ITEM8_P62_S1	For each derivative instrument that is designated and effective as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized immediately to earnings, and offsets the loss or gain on the underlying hedged item.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P62_S2	The gain or loss on fair value hedges is classified in net interest expense, as they hedge the interest rate risk associated with the Company's fixed-rate debt.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P63_S0	The Company reports in " Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss " the effective portion of the gain or loss on derivative financial instruments that are designated, and that qualify, as cash flow hedges.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P63_S1	The Company reclassifies these gains and losses into earnings in the same period in which the underlying hedged transactions affect earnings.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P63_S2	Any hedge ineffectiveness (which represents the amount by which the changes in fair value of the derivative exceed the variability in the cash flows of the forecasted transaction) is recorded in current period earnings.

1099800_14_ITEM8_P178_S0	During 2013, net deferred tax assets increased $12.2 million, including items that were recorded to stockholders' equity and which did not impact the Company's income tax provision.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P179_S0	The valuation allowance of $46.4 million as of December 31, 2013 reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P179_S1	This allowance primarily relates to the net operating loss carryforwards of certain United States and non-United States subsidiaries and to the deferred tax assets established for impairment losses on certain investments and for certain non-United States credit carryforwards.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P180_S0	A valuation allowance of $2.8 million has been provided for other-than-temporary impairments and unrealized losses related to certain investments in unconsolidated affiliates that may not be recognized due to the uncertainty of the ready marketability of certain impaired investments.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P181_S0	Net operating loss carryforwards and the related carryforward periods at December 31, 2013 are summarized as follows (in millions):
1099800_14_ITEM8_P182_S0	Tax credit carryforwards and the related carryforward periods at December 31, 2013 are summarized as follows (in millions):
1099800_14_ITEM8_P183_S0	The Company has $46.6 million of California research expenditure tax credits it expects to use in future periods.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P183_S1	The credits may be carried forward indefinitely.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P183_S2	Based upon anticipated future taxable income, the Company expects that it is more likely than not that all California research expenditure tax credits will be utilized, although the utilization of the full benefit is expected to occur over a number of years and into the far distant future.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P183_S3	Accordingly, no valuation allowance has been provided.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P184_S0	The United States state net operating loss carryforwards include $46.9 million of losses attributable to windfall stock option deductions.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P184_S1	A net benefit of $1.2 million will be recorded to " Additional Paid-in Capital " when realized as a reduction to income taxes payable.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P185_S0	Approximately $17.3 million of the total $55.6 million United States federal and state tax credit carryforwards are attributable to windfall stock option deductions and will be recorded as a benefit to " Additional Paid-in Capital " when realized as a reduction to income taxes payable.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P186_S0	Deferred income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries of approximately $1,368.7 million as of December 31, 2013 since these amounts are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P186_S1	It is not practicable to calculate the deferred taxes associated with these earnings because of the variability of multiple factors that would need to be assessed at the time of any assumed repatriation; however, foreign tax credits would likely be available to reduce federal income taxes in the event of distribution.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P186_S2	In making this assertion, the Company evaluates, among other factors, the profitability of its United States and foreign operations and the need for cash within and outside the United States, including cash requirements for capital improvement, acquisitions, market expansion and stock repurchase programs.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P186_S3	The Company does not expect any earnings for certain of its European subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and records the tax impact in net income currently.

1099800_14_ITEM8_P188_S1	The tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rates favorably impacted earnings per diluted share for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 by $0.44, $0.39 and $0.40, respectively.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P188_S2	The Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Singapore and Switzerland grants provide the Company's manufacturing operations partial or full exemption from local taxes until the years 2028, 2030 (subject to review beginning in 2015), 2024 and 2015, respectively.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P189_S0	A reconciliation of the United States federal statutory income tax rate to the Company's effective income tax rate is as follows (in millions):
1099800_14_ITEM8_P190_S0	Certain previously reported amounts in the above table have been reclassified to conform to our current year presentation.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P191_S0	The federal research credit expired on December 31, 2011 and was not reinstated until January 2, 2013.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P191_S1	As a result, the effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2012 was calculated without a benefit for the federal research credit.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P191_S2	The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 included (1) an $8.4 million benefit for the full year 2012 federal research credit and (2) $31.3 million of tax expense associated with the $83.6 million litigation award received from Medtronic, Inc. in February 2013 (see Note 3).
1099800_14_ITEM8_P192_S0	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions was $127.7 million and $113.6 million, respectively.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P192_S1	The Company estimates that these liabilities would be reduced by $30.9 million and $26.1 million, respectively, from offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes and timing adjustments.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P192_S2	The net amounts of $96.8 million and $87.5 million, respectively, if not required, would favorably affect the Company's effective tax rate.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P193_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest, penalties and foreign exchange, is as follows (in millions):
1099800_14_ITEM8_P194_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P194_S1	As of December 31, 2013, the Company had accrued $4.5 million (net of $3.3 million tax benefit) of interest related to uncertain tax positions, and as of December 31, 2012, the Company had accrued $3.1 million (net of $2.1 million tax benefit) of interest related to uncertain tax positions.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P194_S2	During 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company recognized interest expense, net of tax benefit, of $1.4 million, $1.0 million and $0.4 million, respectively, in " Provision for Income Taxes " on the consolidated statements of operations.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P195_S0	The Company strives to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P195_S1	While the Company has accrued for matters it believes are more likely than not to require settlement, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P195_S2	Furthermore, the Company may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise its right to appeal.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P195_S3	The uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation, regulations or case law.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P196_S0	At December 31, 2013, all material state, local and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2006.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P197_S0	During the third quarter of 2013, the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") completed its fieldwork for the 2009 and 2010 tax years.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P197_S1	The case is currently in suspense pending finalization of an Advance Pricing Agreement ("APA") and Joint Committee of Taxation approval.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P198_S0	The IRS began its examination of the 2011 and 2012 tax years during the fourth quarter of 2013.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P198_S1	The Company has also entered into an APA process between the Switzerland and the United States governments for the years 2009 through 2013 covering transfer pricing matters.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P198_S2	These transfer pricing matters are significant to the Company's consolidated financial statements, and the final outcome of the negotiations between the two governments is uncertain.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P198_S3	Management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result for the Company's uncertain tax positions.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P198_S4	The Company does not anticipate any significant changes in the Company's existing uncertain tax positions in the next 12 months other than immaterial expected settlements which have been classified as current liabilities within the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P199_S0	In February 2008, Edwards Lifesciences filed a lawsuit against CoreValve, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that its ReValving System infringes three of Edwards' U.S. Andersen patents, later narrowed to one patent ("the '552 patent").
1099800_14_ITEM8_P200_S0	Medtronic, Inc. ("Medtronic") acquired CoreValve, Inc. ("Medtronic CoreValve") in April 2009.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P200_S1	In April 2010, a federal jury found the '552 patent to be valid and found that Medtronic CoreValve willfully infringes it.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P200_S2	The jury also awarded Edwards $73.9 million in damages.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P200_S3	In February 2011, the District Court reaffirmed the jury decision and ruled that Edwards is entitled to recover additional damages due to Medtronic CoreValve's continued infringing sales from the trial through the life of the patent, plus interest.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P200_S4	In the same ruling, the court denied Edwards' motions for a permanent injunction, as well as its motion for increased damages relating to Medtronic CoreValve's willful infringement.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P200_S5	In November 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the April 2010 federal jury decision that Medtronic CoreValve is willfully infringing the '552 patent and ordered the trial court to reconsider Edwards' request for a permanent injunction that would prohibit the manufacture or sale of the CoreValve System in the United States.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P200_S6	The Court of Appeals also affirmed the validity of the '552 patent and the federal jury's verdict awarding an initial payment of $73.9 million in damages to Edwards, which covers infringement through early 2010.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P200_S7	In February 2013, the Court of Appeals issued a mandate affirming the judgment of the District Court and directing it to reconsider its prior denial of Edwards' request for a permanent injunction and to assess additional damages for the period after the date of the jury award.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P200_S8	In February 2013, Edwards received a payment of $83.6 million from Medtronic in satisfaction of the April 2010 jury award of damages for infringement, including accrued interest, through April 2010 (see Note 3).
1099800_14_ITEM8_P200_S9	Proceedings continue before the District Court regarding the permanent injunction and the additional damages.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P200_S10	In October 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court denied Medtronic's request for review of the Court of Appeals decision.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P201_S0	A second lawsuit is pending in the same District Court against Medtronic CoreValve and Medtronic alleging infringement of three of Edwards' U.S. Andersen patents.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P201_S1	In July 2013, the District Court dismissed one of the patents from the lawsuit based on the outcome of reexamination proceedings at the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO").
1099800_14_ITEM8_P202_S0	In May 2012, the USPTO granted Medtronic's fourth request to reexamine the validity of the '552 patent and in February 2013 confirmed the validity of that patent.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P203_S0	In June 2011, Medtronic filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota alleging that certain surgical valve holders and a surgical embolic filter device infringe its patents.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P203_S1	Edwards counterclaimed against Medtronic, alleging that the Medtronic Contour 3D annuloplasty ring infringes an Edwards ring patent.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P203_S2	Edwards subsequently added two more patents to its counterclaim.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P203_S3	In February and March 2012, the USPTO granted Edwards' requests to reexamine the validity of three of the four Medtronic patents involved in this lawsuit.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P204_S0	In June 2011, Medtronic CoreValve also filed another lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California alleging that the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve infringes a Medtronic CoreValve patent.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P205_S0	Edwards counterclaimed against Medtronic CoreValve and Medtronic, alleging that the Medtronic CoreValve heart valve infringes Edwards' U.S.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P205_S1	Edwards' counterclaim was subsequently transferred to the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, and in January 2014, a federal jury found Edwards' patent to be valid and found that Medtronic CoreValve willfully infringes it.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P205_S2	The jury also awarded Edwards $393.6 million in damages based on Medtronic's worldwide sales of its infringing devices.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P206_S0	Medtronic filed an appeal, and in January 2014 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit confirmed that Medtronic CoreValve's patent is invalid.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P207_S0	In March 2012, Medtronic filed another lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California alleging that the methods of implanting the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve in the United States infringe two Medtronic patents relating to methods of pacing the heart.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P207_S1	The Company is vigorously defending this lawsuit and trial is scheduled for August 2014.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P208_S0	In August 2012, Edwards filed a lawsuit against Medtronic in the German District Court of Mannheim alleging that Medtronic's CoreValve and Evolut valves infringe two of Edwards' transcatheter valve patents.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P208_S1	These patents were issued by the European Patent Office ("EPO") and were validated as national patents in various European countries, including Germany.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P208_S2	In April 2013, Edwards added a third transcatheter valve patent to the lawsuit.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P208_S3	An infringement hearing was held in April 2013 for one of the original patents, and the Court ruled that the Medtronic valves did not infringe that patent.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P208_S4	In the opposition to the first patent, the EPO determined that patent to be invalid in December 2013.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P208_S5	Edwards intends to appeal this decision.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P208_S6	The hearing for the second patent was held in May 2013 and the Court subsequently ruled that the Medtronic valves infringe that patent.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P208_S7	The Court granted an injunction prohibiting the sale of CoreValve and Evolut systems in Germany, a recall of these products, and an accounting for past damages.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P208_S8	Enforcement of this decision was later stayed pending validity proceedings at the EPO.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P209_S0	In the opposition to the second patent, the EPO issued a non-binding preliminary opinion in October 2013 outlining concerns about the validity of that patent.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P209_S1	An EPO hearing for the opposition to the second patent is scheduled for March 2014.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P209_S2	A hearing date for the third patent is pending determination by the EPO in ongoing related oppositions on the validity of the patent.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P210_S0	In September 2013 and October 2013, persons purporting to represent a class of persons who purchased the common stock of Edwards between April 25, 2012 and April 23, 2013 filed lawsuits against Edwards and certain of its officers in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P210_S1	The lawsuits allege that certain of Edwards' public statements concerning the projected sales and prospects of the SAPIEN transcatheter aortic heart valve were false and misleading and assert claims under Sections 10(b) and 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P210_S2	On February 21, 2014, these suits were voluntarily dismissed without prejudice.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P211_S0	In addition, Edwards Lifesciences is or may be a party to, or may otherwise be responsible for, pending or threatened lawsuits related primarily to products and services currently or formerly manufactured or performed, as applicable, by Edwards Lifesciences.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P211_S1	Such cases and claims raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the facts and circumstances of each particular case or claim, the jurisdiction in which each suit is brought, and differences in applicable law.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P211_S2	Upon resolution of any such legal matter or other claim, Edwards Lifesciences may incur charges in excess of established reserves.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P211_S3	The Company is not able to estimate the amount or range of any loss for legal contingencies for which there is no reserve or additional loss for matters already reserved.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P211_S4	While any such charge could have a material adverse impact on Edwards Lifesciences' net income or cash flows in the period in which it is recorded or paid, management does not believe that any such charge relating to any currently pending lawsuit would have a material adverse effect on Edwards Lifesciences' financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P212_S0	Edwards Lifesciences is subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside of the United States.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P213_S0	While it is difficult to quantify the potential impact of continuing compliance with environmental protection laws, management believes that such compliance will not have a material impact on Edwards Lifesciences' financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P214_S0	Edwards Lifesciences conducts operations worldwide and is managed in the following geographical regions: United States, Europe, Japan and Rest of World.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P214_S1	All regions sell products that are used to treat advanced cardiovascular disease.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P215_S0	The Company's geographic segments are reported based on the financial information provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (the Chief Executive Officer).
1099800_14_ITEM8_P215_S1	The Company evaluates the performance of its geographic segments based on net sales and income before provision for income taxes ("pre-tax income").
1099800_14_ITEM8_P215_S2	The accounting policies of the segments are substantially the same as those described in Note 2.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P216_S0	Segment net sales and segment pre-tax income are based on internally derived standard foreign exchange rates, which may differ from year to year, and do not include inter-segment profits.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P216_S1	Because of the interdependence of the reportable segments, the operating profit as presented may not be representative of the geographical distribution that would occur if the segments were not interdependent.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P217_S0	Net sales by geographic area are based on the location of the customer.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P218_S0	Certain items are maintained at the corporate level and are not allocated to the segments.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P218_S1	The non-allocated items include net interest expense, global marketing expenses, corporate research and development expenses, manufacturing variances, corporate headquarters costs, special gains and charges, stock-based compensation, foreign currency hedging activities, certain litigation costs and most of the Company's amortization expense.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P218_S2	Although most of the Company's depreciation expense is included in segment pre-tax income, due to the Company's methodology for cost build-up, it is impractical to determine the amount of depreciation expense included in each segment, and, therefore, a portion is maintained at the corporate level.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P219_S0	The Company neither discretely allocates assets to its operating segments, nor evaluates the operating segments using discrete asset information.
1099800_14_ITEM8_P220_S0	The table below presents information about Edwards Lifesciences' reportable segments (in millions):
1099800_14_ITEM8_P221_S0	The table below presents reconciliations of segment net sales to consolidated net sales and segment pre-tax income to consolidated pre-tax income (in millions):

1099800_14_ITEM1_P54_S0	We monitor the products of our competitors for possible infringement of our owned and/or licensed patents.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P54_S1	Litigation has been necessary to enforce certain patent rights held by us, and we plan to continue to defend and prosecute our rights with respect to such patents.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P55_S0	We own certain United States registered trademarks used in our business.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P55_S1	Many of our trademarks have also been registered for use in certain foreign countries where registration is available and where we have determined it is commercially advantageous to do so.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P56_S0	Our products and technologies are subject to regulation by numerous domestic and foreign government agencies, including the FDA, and various laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of our products and technologies.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P56_S1	We are also governed by federal, state, local and international laws of general applicability, such as those regulating employee health and safety and the protection of the environment.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P56_S2	Overall, the amount and scope of domestic and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our business is increasing.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P57_S0	In the United States, the FDA has responsibility for regulating medical devices.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P57_S1	The FDA regulates design, development, testing, clinical studies, manufacturing, labeling, promotion and record-keeping for medical devices, and reporting of adverse events, recalls, or other field actions by manufacturers and users to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P57_S2	Many of the devices that we develop and market are in a category for which the FDA has implemented stringent clinical investigation and pre-market clearance or approval requirements.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P58_S0	The process of obtaining FDA clearance or approval to market a product is resource intensive, lengthy and costly.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P58_S1	FDA review may involve substantial delays that adversely affect the marketing and sale of our products.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P58_S2	A number of our products are pending regulatory clearance or approval to begin commercial sales in various markets.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P58_S3	Ultimately, the FDA may not authorize the commercial release of a medical device if it determines the device is not safe and effective or does not meet other standards for clearance.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P58_S4	Additionally, even if a product is cleared or approved, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of these products once commercialized.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P59_S0	The FDA has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order the repair, replacement or refund of the costs of such devices, or preclude the importation of devices that are or appear violative.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P59_S1	The FDA also conducts inspections to determine compliance with the quality system regulations concerning the manufacturing and design of devices and current medical device reporting regulations, recall regulations, clinical testing regulations, and other requirements.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P59_S2	The FDA may withdraw product clearances or approvals due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P59_S3	Additionally, the failure to comply with FDA or comparable regulatory standards or the discovery of previously unknown product problems could result in fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances or approvals, seizures, injunctions, recalls, refunds, civil money penalties, or criminal prosecution.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P59_S4	Our compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P59_S5	Moreover, the FDA and several other United States agencies administer controls over the export of medical devices from the United States and the importation of devices into the United States, which could also subject us to sanctions for noncompliance.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P60_S0	In May 2013, we received a warning letter from the Denver District Office of the FDA resulting from an inspection of our facility in Draper, Utah.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P60_S1	The warning letter relates specifically to the execution of our quality systems within the Cardiac Surgery Systems business, including design and process validation, corrective and preventive actions, finished device acceptance and packaging, and indicated that we would not receive pre-market approvals for devices reasonably related to those issues until the issues are resolved.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P61_S0	Our Utah facility manufactures devices for the Cardiac Surgery Systems business, such as cannulae and cardioplegia catheters, and also makes devices for our other businesses, including heart valve repair rings and transcatheter heart valve delivery system components and accessories.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P62_S0	We are in the process of implementing the necessary actions to respond to the specific issues addressed in the letter and remain committed to thoroughly resolving those issues.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P63_S0	We are also subject to additional laws and regulations that govern our business operations, products and technologies, including:
1099800_14_ITEM1_P64_S0	federal, state and foreign anti-kickback laws and regulations, which generally prohibit payments to physicians or other purchasers of medical products as an inducement to purchase a product; the Stark law, which prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to a provider that bills these programs for the provision of certain designated health services if the physician (or a member of the physician's immediate family) has a financial relationship with that provider; federal and state laws and regulations that protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient records, and restrict the use and disclosure of such information, in particular, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996; the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires public disclosure of the financial relationships of United States physicians and teaching hospitals with applicable manufacturers, including medical device, pharmaceutical and biologics companies; the False Claims Act, which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claims for payment to a federally funded health care program, and health care fraud statutes that prohibit false statements and improper claims to any third-party payor; and the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which can be used to prosecute companies in the United States for arrangements with foreign government officials or other parties outside the United States.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P65_S0	Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal liability, significant fines or penalties, negative publicity and substantial costs and expenses associated with investigation and enforcement activities.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P66_S0	To assist in our compliance efforts, we adhere to many codes of ethics and conduct regarding our sales and marketing activities in the United States and other countries in which we operate.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P66_S1	In addition, we have in place a dedicated team to improve our internal business compliance programs and policies.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P67_S0	Internationally, the regulation of medical devices is complex.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P67_S1	In Europe, our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P67_S2	The regulatory regime in the European Union for medical devices became mandatory in June 1998.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P67_S3	It requires that medical devices may only be placed on the market if they do not compromise safety and health when properly installed, maintained and used in accordance with their intended purpose.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P68_S0	National laws conforming to the European Union's legislation regulate our products under the medical devices regulatory system.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P68_S1	Although the more variable national requirements under which medical devices were formerly regulated have been substantially replaced by the European Union Medical Devices Directive, individual nations can still impose unique requirements that may require supplemental submissions.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P69_S0	The European Union medical device laws require manufacturers to declare that their products conform to the essential regulatory requirements after which the products may be placed on the market bearing the CE Mark.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P69_S1	Manufacturers' quality systems for products in all but the lowest risk classification are also subject to certification and audit by an independent notified body.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P70_S0	In Europe, particular emphasis is being placed on more sophisticated and faster procedures for the reporting of adverse events to the competent authorities.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P71_S0	In Japan, pre-market approval and clinical studies are required as is governmental pricing approval for medical devices.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P71_S1	Clinical studies are subject to a stringent "Good Clinical Practices" standard.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P71_S2	Approval time frames from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare vary from simple notifications to review periods of one or more years, depending on the complexity and risk level of the device.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P71_S3	In addition, importation of medical devices into Japan is subject to the "Good Import Practices" regulations.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P71_S4	As with any highly regulated market, significant changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect future sales.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P72_S0	In many of the other foreign countries in which we market our products, we may be subject to regulations affecting, among other things:
1099800_14_ITEM1_P73_S0	product standards and specifications; packaging requirements; labeling requirements; product collection and disposal requirements; quality system requirements; import restrictions; tariffs; duties; and tax requirements.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P74_S0	Many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the FDA.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P74_S1	In some regions, the level of government regulation of medical devices is increasing, which can lengthen time to market and increase registration and approval costs.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P75_S0	In many countries, the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed and considered eligible for reimbursement.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P76_S0	Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs, including price regulation and competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements, are continuing in many countries where we do business, including the United States, Europe and Japan.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P76_S1	As a result of these changes, the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical therapies.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P76_S2	For example, government programs, private health care insurance and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for procedures or treatments, and some third-party payors require their pre-approval before new or innovative devices or therapies are utilized by patients.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P76_S3	These various initiatives have created increased price sensitivity over medical products generally and may impact demand for our products and technologies.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P77_S0	The delivery of our products is subject to regulation by the Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") and comparable state and foreign agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P77_S1	Foreign governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P78_S0	Reimbursement schedules regulate the amount the United States government will reimburse hospitals and doctors for the inpatient care of persons covered by Medicare.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P78_S1	CMS may also review whether and/or under what circumstances a procedure or technology is reimbursable.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P79_S0	Several legislative proposals in the United States have been advanced that would restrict future funding increases for government-funded programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P79_S1	Changes in current reimbursement levels could have an adverse effect on market demand and our pricing flexibility.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P80_S0	Hospital reimbursement in the United States for TAVR procedures is currently aligned with surgical aortic valve replacement codes.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P81_S0	CMS has issued a National Coverage Determination ("NCD") that provides nationwide Medicare coverage of TAVR for patients who either fall within FDA-approved criteria or are part of an approved clinical study.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P81_S1	In the United States, physician codes and payment rates have also been established for TAVR procedures.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P82_S0	Health care cost containment efforts have also prompted domestic hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power, and this trend is expected to continue.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P83_S0	partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P83_S1	As a result, transactions with customers are larger, more complex and tend to involve more long-term contracts than in the past.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P83_S2	These larger customers, due to their enhanced purchasing power, may attempt to increase the pressure on product pricing.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P84_S0	In 2010, significant reforms to the health care system were adopted as law in the United States.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P84_S1	The law includes provisions that, among other things, reduce or limit Medicare reimbursement, require all individuals to have health insurance (with limited exceptions) and impose increased taxes.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P84_S2	Specifically, the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize health care reform in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on United States sales of most medical devices beginning in 2013.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P84_S3	The excise tax increased our operating expenses.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P84_S4	Because other parts of the 2010 health care law remain subject to implementation, the long-term impact on us is uncertain.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P84_S5	The new law or any future legislation could reduce medical procedure volumes, lower reimbursement for our products, and impact the demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P85_S0	Our quarterly net sales are influenced by many factors, including new product introductions, acquisitions, regulatory approvals, patient and physician holiday schedules, and other factors.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P85_S1	Net sales in the third quarter are typically lower than other quarters of the year due to the seasonality of the United States and European markets, where summer vacation schedules normally result in fewer medical procedures.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P86_S0	As of December 31, 2013, we had approximately 8,600 employees worldwide, the majority of whom were located in the United States, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and Singapore.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P86_S1	Other major concentrations of employees are located in Europe and Japan.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P86_S2	We emphasize competitive compensation, benefits, equity participation and work environment practices in our efforts to attract and retain qualified personnel, and employ a rigorous talent management system.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P86_S3	None of our North American employees are represented by a labor union.
1099800_14_ITEM1_P86_S4	In various countries outside of North America, we interact with trade unions and work councils that represent a limited number of employees.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our business and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	An investor should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P0_S3	If any of these events or circumstances occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially harmed.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P0_S4	In that case, the value of our securities could decline and an investor could lose part or all of his or her investment.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P0_S5	In addition, forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws that are contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in our other filings or statements may be subject to the risks described below as well as other risks and uncertainties.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P0_S6	Please read the cautionary notice regarding forward-looking statements in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," below.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our products may become obsolete and our operating results may suffer.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The cardiovascular products industry is characterized by technological changes, frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Without the timely introduction of new and improved products, our products could become technologically obsolete or more susceptible to competition and our revenue and operating results would suffer.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	indications, entrenched patterns of clinical practice, uncertainty over third-party reimbursement or other factors.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We devote significant financial and other resources to our research and development activities; however, the research and development process is prolonged and entails considerable uncertainty.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Accordingly, products we are currently developing may not complete the development process or obtain the regulatory or other approvals required to market such products in a timely manner or at all.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Technical innovations often require substantial time and investment before we can determine their commercial viability.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We may not have the financial resources necessary to fund all of these projects.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	In addition, even if we are able to successfully develop new or improved products, they may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development, and they may be rendered obsolete or less competitive by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products with newer technologies or features or other factors.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We may incur product liability losses that could adversely affect our operating results.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Our products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In addition, many of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product related risks or product related information could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, patients.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Such a problem could result in product liability lawsuits and claims, safety alerts or product recalls in the future, which, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Product liability claims may be brought from time to time either by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We may incur charges related to such matters in excess of any established reserves and such charges, including the establishment of any such reserves, could have a material adverse impact on our net income and net cash flows.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We may experience supply interruptions that could harm our ability to manufacture products.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We use a broad range of raw and organic materials and other items in the design and manufacture of our products.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Our Surgical and Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy products are manufactured from treated natural animal tissue and man-made materials.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Our non-implantable products are manufactured from man-made raw materials including resins, chemicals, electronics and metals.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P11_S3	We purchase certain of the materials and components used in the manufacture of our products from external suppliers, and we purchase certain supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance, cost-effectiveness, availability or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P11_S4	General economic conditions could adversely affect the financial viability of our suppliers, resulting in their inability to provide materials and components used in the manufacture of our products.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P11_S5	While we work closely with suppliers to monitor their financial viability and to assure continuity of supply and maintain high quality and reliability, these efforts may not be successful.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P11_S6	In addition, due to the rigorous regulations and requirements of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products (including the need for approval of any change in supply arrangements), we may have difficulty establishing additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or at all if the need arises.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P11_S7	Although alternative supplier options are considered and identified, we typically do not pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships and the time and expense associated with the regulatory validation process.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P11_S8	A change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to product performance or incorporate unique technology, and the loss of any existing supply contract could have a material adverse effect on us.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Regulatory agencies in the United States or other international geographies from time to time have limited or banned the use of certain materials used in the manufacture of our products.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	In these circumstances, transition periods typically provide time to arrange for alternative materials.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	SEC enacted disclosure rules regarding products that may contain certain minerals that originate from conflict areas in and around the Democratic Republic of Congo.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	If our suppliers cannot certify that their components do not originate from these conflict areas, we may need to source components from alternative suppliers.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P13_S2	If we are unable to identify alternative materials or suppliers and secure approval for their use in a timely manner, our business could be harmed.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Some of our suppliers are located outside the United States.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	As a result, trade or regulatory embargoes imposed by foreign countries or the United States could result in delays or shortages that could harm our business.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	If we or one of our suppliers encounters manufacturing or quality problems, our business could suffer.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls, due in part to rigorous regulatory requirements.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	In addition, quality is extremely important due to the serious and costly consequences of a product failure.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Problems can arise during the manufacturing process for a number of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow protocols and procedures, raw material problems or human error.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P16_S3	If these problems arise or if we otherwise fail to meet our internal quality standards or those of the FDA or other applicable regulatory body, which include detailed record-keeping requirements, our reputation could be damaged, we could become subject to a safety alert or a recall, we could incur product liability and other costs, product approvals could be delayed and our business could otherwise be adversely affected.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	In addition, our manufacturing facilities in California, Utah, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico could be materially damaged by earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters or catastrophic circumstances.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	While we believe that our exposure to significant losses from a catastrophic disaster could be partially mitigated by our ability to manufacture some of our products at our other manufacturing facilities, the losses could have a material adverse effect on our business for an indeterminate period of time before this manufacturing transition is complete and operates without significant disruption.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We may be required, from time to time, to recognize charges in connection with the write-down of our asset or business dispositions, or for other reasons.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	From time to time we identify businesses and products that are not performing at a level commensurate with the rest of our business.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We may seek to dispose of these underperforming businesses or products.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We may also seek to dispose of other businesses or products for strategic or other business reasons.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P19_S3	If we cannot dispose of a business or product on acceptable terms, we may voluntarily cease operations related to that business or product.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Any of these events could result in charges, which could be substantial and which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We may not successfully identify and complete acquisitions or strategic alliances on favorable terms or achieve anticipated synergies relating to any acquisitions or alliances, and such acquisitions could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, require significant management resources and require significant charges or write-downs.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We regularly explore potential acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, as well as potential strategic alliances.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates or appropriate partners with which to form alliances.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Even if we identify appropriate acquisition or alliance candidates, we may be unable to complete the acquisitions or alliances on favorable terms, if at all.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P21_S3	In addition, the process of integrating an acquired business, technology, service or product into our existing operations could result in unforeseen difficulties and expenditures.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	for ongoing development of our other businesses.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Moreover, we may not realize the anticipated financial or other benefits of an acquisition or alliance.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We may be required to take charges or write-downs in connection with acquisitions.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	In particular, acquisitions of businesses engaged in the development of new products may give rise to in-process research and development ("IPR D") assets.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	To the extent that the value of these assets declines, we may be required to write down the value of the assets.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Also, in connection with certain asset acquisitions, we may be required to take an immediate charge related to acquired IPR D. Either of these situations could result in substantial charges, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Future acquisitions could also involve the issuance of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization of expenses related to other intangible assets, any of which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	In addition, equity or debt financing required for such acquisitions may not be available.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	General economic and political conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	External factors can affect our profitability and financial condition.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Such external factors include general domestic and global economic conditions, such as interest rates, tax rates and factors affecting global economic stability, and the political environment regarding health care in general.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P26_S2	The strength and timing of the current economic recovery remains uncertain, and we cannot predict to what extent the global economic conditions may negatively impact our business.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P26_S3	For example, negative conditions in the credit and capital markets could impair our ability to access the financial markets for working capital or other funds, and could negatively impact our ability to borrow.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P26_S4	An increase in interest rates could result in an increase in our borrowing costs and could otherwise restrict our ability to access the capital markets.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P26_S5	Such conditions could result in decreased liquidity and impairments in the carrying value of our investments, and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P26_S6	These and other conditions could also adversely affect our customers, and may impact their ability or decision to purchase our products or make payments on a timely basis.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	In 2010, significant reforms to the health care system were adopted as law in the United States.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The law includes provisions that, among other things, reduce or limit Medicare reimbursement, require all individuals to have health insurance (with limited exceptions) and impose increased taxes.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Specifically, the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize health care reform in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on United States sales of most medical devices beginning in 2013.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P27_S3	The excise tax increased our operating expenses.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P27_S4	Because other parts of the 2010 health care law remain subject to implementation, the long-term impact on us is uncertain.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P27_S5	The new law or any future legislation could reduce medical procedure volumes, lower reimbursement for our products, and impact the demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P27_S6	For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, which provided an increase to the United States debt limit, imposed significant cuts in federal spending over the next decade.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P27_S7	This measure and other such deficit reduction legislation could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and prospects if they were to result in cuts to, or a restructuring of, entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We do business with governments outside the United States.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	A number of these countries, including certain European countries, have experienced a deterioration in credit and economic conditions.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P28_S2	These conditions have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a reduction in the number of procedures that use our products and an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect accounts receivable outstanding in these countries.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P28_S3	In addition, we have been and may continue to be impacted by declines in sovereign credit ratings or sovereign defaults in these countries.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our business is subject to economic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations, including risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Because we sell our products in a number of countries, our business is subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including risks associated with United States government oversight and enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as well as with the United Kingdom's Bribery Act and anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Our net sales originating outside of the United States, as a percentage of total net sales, were 54% in 2013.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P30_S2	We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P30_S3	In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the United States.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	changes in local medical reimbursement policies and programs; changes in foreign regulatory requirements; changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions, such as the current financial uncertainties in Europe and changing circumstances in emerging regions; trade protection measures, quotas, embargoes, import or export licensing requirements and duties, tariffs or surcharges; potentially negative impact of tax laws, including transfer pricing liabilities and tax costs associated with the repatriation of cash; difficulty in staffing and managing global operations; cultural, exchange rate or other local factors affecting financial terms with customers; local economic and financial conditions affecting the collectability of receivables, including receivables from sovereign entities; an outbreak of any life-threatening communicable disease; economic and political instability and local economic and political conditions; differing labor regulations; and differing protection of intellectual property.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Substantially all of our sales outside of the United States are denominated in local currencies.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Measured in local currency, a substantial portion of our international sales was generated in Europe (and primarily denominated in the Euro) and in Japan.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P32_S2	The United States dollar value of our international sales varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Decreases in the value of the United States dollar to the Euro or the Japanese yen have the effect of increasing our reported revenues even when the volume of international sales has remained constant.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P32_S4	Increases in the value of the United States dollar relative to the Euro or the Japanese yen, as well as other currencies, have the opposite effect and, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our reported revenues and results of operations.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P32_S5	We have a hedging program for certain currencies that attempts to manage currency exchange rate risks to an acceptable level based on management's judgment of the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity and cost; however, this hedging program does not completely eliminate the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act, and similar laws in other jurisdictions contain prohibitions against bribery and other illegal payments or for the failure to have procedures in place that prevent such payments.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Recent years have seen an increasing number of investigations and other enforcement activities under these laws.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Although we have compliance programs in place with respect to these laws, no assurance can be given that a violation will not be found, and if found, the resulting penalties could adversely affect us and our business.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The stock market can be volatile and fluctuations in our quarterly sales and operating results as well as other factors could cause our financial guidance to vary from actual results and our stock price to decline.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	From time to time the stock market experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P35_S1	This volatility can have a significant effect on the market prices of securities for reasons unrelated to underlying performance.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P35_S2	These broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect our stock price, regardless of our operating results.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P35_S3	In addition, the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in response to any of the other risk factors set out above and below, as well as a number of other factors, including the performance of comparable companies or the medical device industry, or changes in financial estimates and recommendations of securities analysts.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P36_S1	A high proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to significant sales, research and development, and manufacturing costs.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Thus, small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter, and the price of our common stock could fall.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Other factors that could affect our quarterly sales and operating results include:
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	announcements of innovations, new products, strategic developments or business combinations by us or our competitors; demand for and clinical acceptance of products; the timing and execution of customer contracts, particularly large contracts that would materially affect our operating results in a given quarter; the timing of sales of products and of the introduction of new products; the timing of marketing, training, and other expenses related to the introduction of new products; the timing of regulatory approvals; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; delays or problems in introducing new products, such as slower than anticipated adoption of transcatheter heart valves; changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors; the timing of approvals of governmental reimbursement rates or changes in reimbursement rates for our products; increased expenses, whether related to sales and marketing, raw materials or supplies, product development or administration; changes in the level of economic activity in the United States or other regions in which we do business; costs related to acquisitions of technologies or businesses; and our ability to expand our operations and the amount and timing of expansion-related expenditures.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The quarterly and full-year financial guidance we provide to investors and analysts with insight to our view of our future performance is based on assumptions about our sales and operating results.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Due to the nature of our business and the numerous factors that can impact our sales and operating performance, including those described above, our financial guidance may vary from actual results.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P38_S2	If we fail to meet any financial guidance that we provide, or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance during the year, the price of our common stock could decline.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We face intense competition, and if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The cardiovascular medical device industry is highly competitive.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P40_S1	We compete with many companies, some of which have longer operating histories, better brand or name recognition, and broader product offerings.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Our customers consider many factors when selecting a product, including product reliability, breadth of product line, clinical outcomes, product availability, price, availability and rate of reimbursement, and services provided by the manufacturer.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P40_S3	In addition, our ability to compete will depend in large part on our ability to develop and acquire new products and technologies, anticipate technology advances and keep pace with other developers of cardiovascular therapies and technologies.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Our sales, technical and other key personnel play an integral role in the development, marketing and selling of new and existing products.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	If we are unable to recruit, hire, develop and retain a talented, competitive workforce, our ability to compete may be adversely affected.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Our competitive position can also be adversely affected by product problems, physician advisories and safety alerts, reflecting the importance of quality in the medical device industry.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Our position can shift as a result of any of these factors.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P41_S3	See " Competition " under " Business " included herein.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The health care industry has been consolidating, and organizations such as GPOs, independent delivery networks, and large single accounts such as the United States Veterans Administration continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for many of our health care provider customers.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P43_S1	As a result, transactions with customers are larger, more complex, and tend to involve more long-term contracts.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P43_S2	The purchasing power of these larger customers has increased, and may continue to increase, causing downward pressure on product pricing.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P43_S3	If we are not one of the providers selected by one of these organizations, we may be precluded from making sales to its members or participants.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P43_S4	Even if we are one of the selected providers, we may be at a disadvantage relative to other selected providers that are able to offer volume discounts based on purchases of a broader range of medical equipment and supplies.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P43_S5	Further, we may be required to commit to pricing that has a material adverse effect on our revenues and profit margins, business, financial condition and results of operations.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P43_S6	We expect that market demand, governmental regulation, third-party reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide health care industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances, which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our inability to protect our intellectual property or other sensitive company data could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Our success and competitive position are dependent in part upon our proprietary intellectual property.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P45_S1	We rely on a combination of patents and trade secrets to protect our proprietary intellectual property, and we expect to continue to do so.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Although we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of means, we cannot guarantee that the protective steps we have taken are adequate to protect these rights.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged and held invalid.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P46_S1	In addition, as our patents expire, we may be unsuccessful in extending their protection through patent term extensions.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P46_S2	The expiration of, or the failure to maintain or extend our patents, could have a material adverse effect on us.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We also rely on confidentiality agreements with certain employees, consultants and other third parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary information.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P47_S1	These agreements could be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for such a breach.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P47_S2	In addition, others could independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary information.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Our intellectual property, other proprietary technology and other sensitive company data is potentially vulnerable to loss, damage or misappropriation from system malfunction, computer viruses, unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access, and other events.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition or results of operations.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We spend significant resources to enforce our intellectual property rights, sometimes resulting in litigation.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Intellectual property litigation is complex and can be expensive and time-consuming.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P50_S2	However, our efforts in this regard may not be successful.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P50_S3	We may not be able to detect infringement.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P50_S4	In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Patent litigation can result in substantial cost and diversion of effort.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Intellectual property protection may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, enabling our competitors to capture increased market position.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P51_S2	The invalidation of key intellectual property rights or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits filed to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or prospects.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P53_S0	During recent years, we and our competitors have been involved in substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P53_S1	From time to time, we have been and may in the future be forced to defend against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, and such intellectual property litigation is typically costly and time-consuming.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Adverse determinations in any such litigation could result in significant liabilities to third parties or injunctions, or could require us to seek licenses from third parties and, if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms, prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using certain products, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on us.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P53_S3	In addition, some licenses may be non-exclusive, which could provide our competitors access to the same technologies.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Third parties could also obtain patents that may require us to either redesign products or, if possible, negotiate licenses from such third parties.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Such licenses may materially increase our expenses.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P54_S2	If we are unable to redesign products or obtain a license, we might have to exit a particular product offering.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We and our customers are subject to rigorous governmental regulations and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products that are compatible with these regulations.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P55_S1	In addition, failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial sanctions which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P56_S0	The medical devices we manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities, including regulations that cover the composition, labeling, testing, clinical study, design, sourcing, manufacturing, packaging, marketing, advertising, promotion and distribution of our products.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We are required to register with the FDA as a device manufacturer.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P57_S1	As a result, we are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA's Quality System Regulation ("QSR") requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, design, quality control and documentation procedures.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P57_S2	The FDA may also inspect our compliance with requirements related to adverse event reporting, recalls or corrections (field actions), the conduct of clinical studies, and other requirements.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P58_S0	In the European Union, we are required to maintain certain CE Mark and ISO certifications in order to sell our products, and are subject to periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P58_S1	If we or our suppliers fail to adhere to QSR, CE Mark, ISO or similar requirements, this could delay or interrupt product production or sales and/or lead to fines, difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances, recalls or other consequences, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or prospects.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Medical devices must receive FDA clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the United States.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P60_S0	based upon the results of post-marketing programs.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P60_S1	In addition, the federal Medical Device Reporting regulations require us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Federal regulations also require us to report certain recalls or corrective actions to the FDA.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P60_S3	Furthermore, most major markets for medical devices outside the United States require clearance, approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P60_S4	The process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device, particularly from the FDA and certain foreign governmental authorities, can be costly and time-consuming, and clearances or approvals may not be granted for products or product improvements on a timely basis, if at all.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P60_S5	Delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, clearances or approvals for products or product improvements could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations or prospects.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P61_S0	At any time after approval of a product for commercial sale, the FDA may conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with QSR requirements, and/or current Medical Device Reporting regulations, or other regulatory requirements.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Noncompliance with applicable requirements may subject us or responsible individuals to sanctions including civil money penalties, product seizure, injunction, or criminal prosecution.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P61_S2	In addition, the FDA may withhold or delay pre-market approval of our products until the noncompliance is resolved.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Product approvals by the FDA can also be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Regulatory agencies in the United States or other international geographies from time to time limit or ban the use of certain materials used in the manufacture of our products, require collection and disposal of products at the end of their lifecycle, and require disclosure of the origin of certain raw materials in our products.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Noncompliance with applicable requirements could have a material adverse affect on our business.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P63_S0	The Physician Payment Sunshine Act also imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements on device, pharmaceutical and biologics companies for certain financial relationships with United States health care providers and teaching hospitals.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Failure to submit required information or submitting incorrect information may result in significant civil monetary penalties.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P63_S2	We will be required to report such aggregate data by March 31, 2014 and detailed data by May 30, 2014.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We are also subject to various United States and international laws pertaining to health care pricing, anti-corruption, and fraud and abuse, including prohibitions on kickbacks and the submission of false claims laws and restrictions on relationships with physicians and other referral sources.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P64_S1	These laws are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation, which could require us to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if we are found not to be in compliance.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions against us and our officers and employees, including substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in governmental health care programs.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Despite our implementation of robust compliance processes, we may be subject, from time to time, to inspections, investigations and other enforcement actions by governmental authorities.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P65_S1	If we are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, the applicable governmental authority can impose fines, delay, suspend, or revoke regulatory clearances or approvals, institute proceedings to detain or seize our products, issue a recall, impose marketing or operating restrictions, enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against us or our officers or employees, and institute criminal prosecution.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P65_S2	Moreover, governmental authorities can ban or request the recall, repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any device or product we manufacture or distribute.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P65_S3	Any of the foregoing actions could result in decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P65_S4	In addition to the sanctions for noncompliance described above, commencement of an enforcement proceeding, inspection or investigation could divert substantial management attention from the operation of our business and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Our industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities, which may lead to greater governmental regulation in the future.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P67_S0	In recent years, the medical device industry has been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny, including by the FDA, numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities, as well as members of Congress.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P67_S1	This has included increased regulation, enforcement, inspections, and governmental investigations of the medical device industry and disclosure of financial relationships with health care professionals.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P67_S2	We anticipate that the government will continue to scrutinize our industry closely, and that additional regulation by governmental authorities, both foreign and domestic, may increase compliance costs, exposure to litigation and other adverse effects to our operations.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Unsuccessful clinical trials or procedures relating to products under development could have a material adverse effect on our prospects.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P69_S0	The regulatory approval process for new products and new indications for existing products requires extensive clinical trials and procedures, including early clinical experiences and regulatory studies.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from current or future clinical trials or procedures conducted by us, our competitors, or third parties, or perceptions regarding this clinical data, could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary approvals and the market's view of our future prospects.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P69_S2	Such clinical trials and procedures are inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that these trials or procedures will be completed in a timely or cost-effective manner or result in a commercially viable product.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P69_S3	Failure to successfully complete these trials or procedures in a timely and cost-effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our prospects.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Clinical trials or procedures may experience significant setbacks even after earlier trials have shown promising results.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P70_S1	Further, preliminary results from clinical trials or procedures may be contradicted by subsequent clinical analysis.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P70_S2	In addition, results from our clinical trials or procedures may not be supported by actual long-term studies or clinical experience.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P70_S3	If preliminary clinical results are later contradicted, or if initial results cannot be supported by actual long-term studies or clinical experience, our business could be adversely affected.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P70_S4	Clinical trials or procedures may be suspended or terminated by us, the FDA or other regulatory authorities at any time if it is believed that the trial participants face unacceptable health risks.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Certain of our products, including pericardial tissue valves, are manufactured using bovine tissue.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Concerns relating to the potential transmission of BSE, commonly known as "mad cow disease," from cows to humans may result in reduced acceptance of products containing bovine materials.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P72_S1	Certain medical device regulatory agencies have considered whether to continue to permit the sale of medical devices that incorporate bovine material.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P73_S0	We obtain bovine tissue only from closely controlled sources within the United States and Australia.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P73_S1	The bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valves is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility for the suspected BSE infectious agent.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P73_S2	We have not experienced any significant adverse impact on our sales as a result of concerns regarding BSE, but no assurance can be given that such an impact may not occur in the future.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P74_S0	If third-party payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or impose other cost containment measures to reduce reimbursement levels, our ability to profitably sell our products will be harmed.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P75_S0	We sell our products and technologies to hospitals, doctors and other health care providers, all of which receive reimbursement for the health care services provided to patients from third-party payors, such as government programs (both domestic and international), private insurance plans and managed care programs.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P75_S1	The ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products from private and governmental third-party payors is critical to the success of medical technology companies.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P75_S2	The availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P75_S3	Reimbursement varies from country to country and can significantly impact acceptance of new products.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P76_S1	There can be no assurance that levels of reimbursement, if any, will not be decreased in the future, or that future legislation, regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payors will not otherwise adversely affect the demand for and price levels of our products.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P77_S0	The introduction of cost containment incentives, combined with closer scrutiny of health care expenditures by both private health insurers and employers, has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P77_S1	Hospitals or physicians may respond to such cost-containment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other therapies.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P77_S2	In addition, the 2010 United States health care law could adversely affect reimbursement levels for our products, or otherwise adversely affect our product pricing and profitability.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs, including price regulation, are underway in several countries around the world.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P78_S1	In many countries, customers are reimbursed for our products under a government operated insurance system.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P78_S2	Under such a system, the government periodically reviews reimbursement levels and may limit patient access.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P78_S3	If a government were to decide to reduce reimbursement levels, our product pricing could be adversely affected.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods as determined by such third-party payors, or was used for an unapproved indication.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P79_S1	Third-party payors may also deny reimbursement for experimental procedures and devices.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P80_S0	We believe that many of our existing products are cost-effective, even though the one-time cost may be significant, because they are intended to reduce overall health care costs over a long period of time.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P80_S1	We cannot be certain that these third-party payors will recognize these cost savings instead of merely focusing on the lower initial costs associated with competing therapies.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P80_S2	If our products are not considered cost-effective by third-party payors, our customers may not be reimbursed for them, resulting in lower sales of our products.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Use of our products in unapproved circumstances could expose us to liabilities.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P82_S0	The marketing approval from the FDA and other regulators of certain of our products are, or are expected to be, limited to specific indications.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P82_S1	We are prohibited by law from marketing or promoting any unapproved use of our products.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P82_S2	Physicians, however, can use these products in ways or circumstances other than those strictly within the scope of the regulatory approval.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P82_S3	Although the product training we provide to physicians and other health care professionals is limited to approved uses or for clinical trials, no assurance can be given that claims might not be asserted against us if our products are used in ways or for procedures that are not approved.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Our operations are subject to environmental, health and safety regulations that could result in substantial costs.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Our operations are subject to environmental, health and safety laws, and regulations concerning, among other things, the generation, handling, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes, the cleanup of hazardous substance releases, and emissions or discharges into the air or water.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P84_S1	We have incurred and may incur expenditures in the future in connection with environmental, health and safety laws, and regulations.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P84_S2	New laws and regulations, violations of these laws or regulations, stricter enforcement of existing requirements, or the discovery of previously unknown contamination could require us to incur costs or could become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could be material.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P85_S0	The success of many of our products depends upon strong relationships with certain key physicians.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P86_S0	The development, marketing and sale of many of our products requires us to maintain working relationships with physicians upon whom we rely to provide considerable knowledge and experience.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P86_S1	These physicians may assist us as researchers, marketing consultants, product trainers and consultants, inventors and as public speakers.
1099800_14_ITEM1A_P87_S0	relationships with these professionals or to continue to receive their advice and input, the development and marketing of our products could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1099800_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	The locations and uses of our major properties are as follows:
1099800_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	The Irvine, California lease expires in 2021; the Draper, Utah lease expires in 2024; the Dominican Republic property has one lease that expires in 2016 and one that expires in 2019; the Puerto Rico property has one lease that expires in 2016 and one that expires in 2018; the Horw, Switzerland lease expires in 2015; the Tokyo, Japan lease expires in 2015; and Singapore has one land lease that expires in 2036 and one that expires in 2041.
1099800_14_ITEM2_P2_S0	We believe our properties have been well maintained, are in good operating condition and are adequate for current needs.
1099800_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	For a description of our material pending legal proceedings, please see Note 16 to the " Consolidated Financial Statements " of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated by reference.
1099800_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	The principal market for our common stock is the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE").
1099800_14_ITEM5_P0_S1	The table below sets forth, for the calendar quarters indicated, the high and low sales prices of our common stock as reported by the NYSE.
1099800_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	On January 31, 2014, there were 16,519 stockholders of record of our common stock.
1099800_14_ITEM5_P2_S0	We have never paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends.
1099800_14_ITEM5_P2_S1	Our current policy is to retain any future earnings for use in our business.
1099800_14_ITEM5_P3_S0	The difference between the total number of shares (or units) purchased and the total number of shares (or units) purchased as part of publicly announced plans or programs is due to shares withheld by us to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units issued to employees.
1099800_14_ITEM5_P3_S1	(b) On May 14, 2013, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to purchase on the open market, including pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, and in privately negotiated transactions up to $750.0 million of our common stock from time to time until December 31, 2016.
1099800_14_ITEM5_P3_S2	In October 2013, our August accelerated share repurchase ("ASR") agreement concluded, and in November 2013, we received an additional 0.4 million shares of our common stock.
1099800_14_ITEM5_P3_S3	Shares purchased pursuant to the ASR agreement are presented in the table above in the periods in which they were received.
1099800_14_ITEM5_P4_S0	The following graph compares the performance of our common stock with that of the S P 500 Index and the S P 500 Healthcare Equipment Index.
1099800_14_ITEM5_P4_S1	The cumulative total return listed below assumes an initial investment of $100 on December 31, 2008 and reinvestment of dividends.
1099800_14_ITEM6_P0_S0	The information set forth below should be read in conjunction with our "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Consolidated Financial Statements" found elsewhere in this Form 10-K. See Note 3 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for discussions of the effect of certain transactions on our operations.
1099800_14_ITEM6_P1_S0	(a) See Note 3 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for additional information regarding special (gains) charges of $(67.3) million, $16.0 million and $21.6 million during 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1099800_14_ITEM6_P1_S1	(b) In October 2013, we issued $600.0 million of 2.875% fixed-rate unsecured senior notes due October 15, 2018 ("the Notes").
1099800_14_ITEM6_P1_S2	A portion of the proceeds from the Notes were used to repay all amounts outstanding under our Four-Year Credit Agreement ("the Credit Facility").
1099800_14_ITEM6_P1_S3	Our previous Five-Year Unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement ("the Credit Agreement") matured on September 29, 2011.
1099800_14_ITEM6_P1_S4	Therefore, at December 31, 2010, all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement were classified as short-term obligations as these obligations were due within one year.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis presents the factors that had a material effect on our results of operations during the three years ended December 31, 2013.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	Also discussed is our financial position as of December 31, 2013.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P0_S2	You should read this discussion in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	We are the global leader in the science of heart valves and hemodynamic monitoring.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	Driven by a passion to help patients, we partner with clinicians to develop innovative technologies in the areas of structural heart disease and critical care monitoring, enabling them to save and enhance lives.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P1_S2	We conduct operations worldwide and are managed in the following geographical regions: United States, Europe, Japan and Rest of World.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P1_S3	Our products are categorized into the following main areas:
1099800_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	Surgical Heart Valve Therapy, Transcatheter Heart Valves, and Critical Care.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	The following is a summary of our financial performance (dollars in millions, except per share data):
1099800_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our sales growth was driven by our Transcatheter Heart Valves product group due to strong growth in Europe and, starting in 2013, the United States.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	Our gross profit margin has benefited from a more profitable product mix, led by the increased Transcatheter Heart Valve sales, but has been tempered by higher manufacturing costs as we have prepared for new product launches.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P4_S2	Net income in 2013 also benefited from the $52.3 million litigation award, net of tax, received from Medtronic, Inc.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	We continue to significantly invest in research and development to extend and defend our leadership position.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	The medical device industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	Our success is measured both by the development of innovative products and the value we bring to our stakeholders.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P6_S2	We are committed to developing new technologies and providing innovative patient care, and we are committed to defending our intellectual property.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P6_S3	To strengthen our leadership and enable future growth opportunities, in 2013 we invested 15.8 percent of our net sales in research and development.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P6_S4	In the coming year, we expect increased competition with our Transcatheter Heart Valves as our competitors begin introducing products in the United States and Europe.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P6_S5	The following is a summary of important Transcatheter Heart Valve developments during 2013:
1099800_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	clinical evidence in The PARTNER II Trial demonstrated similar outcomes between the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve and the Edwards SAPIEN XT transcatheter heart valve in inoperable patients, a positive step toward the approval of SAPIEN XT and its lower profile delivery system; longer-term updates from The PARTNER Trial strengthened the evidence that the SAPIEN valve is a safe and less-invasive alternative for patients who need valve replacement, but are at high surgical risk; and we received regulatory approval and reimbursement for our Edwards SAPIEN XT valve in Japan and, in January 2014, regulatory approval in Europe to launch our SAPIEN 3 valve.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	United States studies of the SAPIEN 3 valve were initiated in August 2013.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	We are dedicated to generating robust clinical and economic evidence increasingly expected by patients, clinicians and payors in the new healthcare environment, with a goal of enhancing the value of delivering comprehensive care.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	The $127.5 million increase in net sales in the United States in 2013 was due primarily to:
1099800_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	Transcatheter Heart Valves, which increased net sales by $106.1 million, driven primarily by sales of the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	Procedure volume increased following the FDA action in October 2012 to expand the indicated patient population and access routes compared to the original 2011 approval.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	The $18.4 million increase in international net sales in 2013 was due primarily to:
1099800_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $43.9 million, due primarily to the weakening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of the Euro against the United States dollar.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	The $206.5 million increase in net sales in the United States in 2012 was due primarily to:
1099800_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	Transcatheter Heart Valves, which increased net sales by $203.5 million, driven primarily by sales of the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve which was launched in the fourth quarter of 2011.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	The $14.5 million increase in international net sales in 2012 was due primarily to:
1099800_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $42.4 million, due primarily to the weakening of the Euro against the United States dollar.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net sales is not necessarily indicative of the impact on net income due to the corresponding effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on international manufacturing and operating costs, and our hedging activities.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	The $13.7 million increase in net sales of Surgical Heart Valve Therapy products in 2013 was due primarily to:
1099800_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $20.2 million, due primarily to the weakening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	The $3.1 million increase in net sales of Surgical Heart Valve Therapy products in 2012 was due primarily to:
1099800_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $15.3 million, due primarily to the weakening of the Euro against the United States dollar.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	At the end of the first quarter of 2013, we received approval to sell our Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna Ease valve in China.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	In the United States, we received approval from the FDA to include EDWARDS INTUITY Elite, our next-generation minimally invasive aortic valve surgery system, in our ongoing TRANSFORM Trial, a clinical trial designed to support FDA approval for the product.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P23_S2	We continued to enroll patients in our COMMENCE clinical trial, which is studying our next-generation GLX tissue treatment platform applied to the Magna Ease aortic surgical valve and the Magna Mitral Ease valve.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	The $155.6 million increase in net sales of Transcatheter Heart Valves in 2013 was due primarily to:
1099800_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	a $14.1 million sales reserve for estimated Transcatheter Heart Valve product returns expected in 2014 upon introduction of the Edwards SAPIEN 3 transcatheter valve system in Europe and the Edwards SAPIEN XT transcatheter heart valve in the United States.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	Additional sales reserves are expected in 2014 for incremental estimated Transcatheter Heart Valve product returns.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	The $218.3 million increase in net sales of Transcatheter Heart Valves in 2012 was due primarily to:
1099800_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $16.7 million, due primarily to the weakening of the Euro against the United States dollar.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2013, we completed enrollment in Cohort A, the surgical arm of The PARTNER II Trial, which is evaluating the Edwards SAPIEN XT transcatheter heart valve for the United States market.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	We submitted our pre-market approval for Cohort B of The PARTNER II Trial to the FDA during the second quarter of 2013 and the FDA's evaluation remains pending.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	Cohort B is designed for patients with a higher risk profile who are deemed inoperable.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P29_S1	Also during the second quarter of 2013, we received approval for SAPIEN XT in Japan, and began commercial sales in October 2013.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P29_S2	During the third quarter of 2013, we received approval for SAPIEN in Australia and SAPIEN XT in Canada, and received FDA approval to expand The PARTNER II Trial to include a 500 patient cohort to study the Edwards SAPIEN 3 transcatheter valve system in high risk and inoperable patients.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P29_S3	Also, in the third quarter of 2013, the FDA revised the label for our SAPIEN valve to remove references to specific access points, now making it available for patients who need alternate access points.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	In January 2014, we received FDA approval to expand The PARTNER II Trial to include a 1,000 patient single-arm, non-randomized cohort to study the Edwards SAPIEN 3 transcatheter valve system in the treatment of intermediate risk patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	In addition, in January 2014, we received CE Mark for SAPIEN 3 in Europe and immediately commenced a launch.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	The $23.4 million decrease in net sales of Critical Care products in 2013 was due primarily to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $28.9 million, due primarily to the weakening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	The $0.4 million decrease in net sales of Critical Care products in 2012 was due primarily to:
1099800_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	advanced monitoring products, which increased net sales by $16.7 million, driven by FloTrac systems.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	The 0.5 percentage point increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2013 was driven by:
1099800_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	a 1.3 percentage point decrease due primarily to higher manufacturing costs due to capacity expansion in preparation for multiple Transcatheter Heart Valve product introductions.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	The 3.2 percentage point increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2012 was driven by:
1099800_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	the voluntary recalls in the second quarter of 2012 of certain of our heart valves and Critical Care catheters, and manufacturing inefficiencies.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	The $40.3 million increase in SG A expenses in 2013 was due primarily to (1) higher sales and marketing expenses in the United States and Japan, mainly to support the Transcatheter Heart Valve program and (2) the 2.3% excise tax, or $15.8 million, on United States sales of most medical devices which became effective in 2013.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	These increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency, which reduced expenses by $12.4 million due primarily to the weakening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P38_S2	The decrease in SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2013 was due primarily to decreased SG A expenses in Europe as a percentage of net sales.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	The $62.9 million increase in SG A expenses in 2012 was due primarily to higher sales and marketing expenses in the United States, mainly to support the launch of the Transcatheter Heart Valve program.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	The decrease in SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2012 was primarily due to the impact of foreign currency and lower sales and marketing expenses in Europe as a percentage of net sales.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P39_S2	The impact of foreign currency reduced SG A expenses by $17.0 million due primarily to the weakening of the Euro against the United States dollar.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	The increase in research and development expenses in 2013 and 2012 was due primarily to additional investments in clinical studies and new product development efforts in the Transcatheter Heart Valve program.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	In February 2013, we received $83.6 million from Medtronic, Inc. in satisfaction of the April 2010 jury award of damages for infringement of the U.S. Andersen transcatheter heart valve patent, including accrued interest.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	In December 2011, we recorded a $3.3 million charge related to a litigation settlement.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	In December 2013, we recorded a $10.4 million charge related primarily to severance expenses associated with a global workforce realignment impacting 118 employees.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	As of December 31, 2013, our remaining severance obligations of $9.2 million are expected to be substantially paid by the end of 2014.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	In December 2012, we recorded a $9.0 million charge related primarily to severance expenses associated with a global workforce realignment impacting 92 employees.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	As of December 31, 2013, payments related to the realignment were substantially complete.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	In December 2011, we recorded a $5.5 million charge related primarily to severance expenses associated with a global workforce realignment impacting 49 employees.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	As of December 31, 2013, payments related to the realignment were complete.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	In December 2013, we recorded a $5.9 million write-off of IPR D assets acquired from Embrella Cardiovascular, Inc.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	In April 2012, we obtained an exclusive license to a suturing device for minimally invasive surgery applications.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	The intellectual property is under development and there is uncertainty as to whether the product will ultimately be approved.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P47_S2	We recorded a charge of $2.0 million related to the upfront licensing and royalty fees.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	In June 2012, we obtained a co-exclusive sublicense to intellectual property related to processing tissue and implanting cardiovascular valves.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	The intellectual property is under development and there is uncertainty as to whether the product will ultimately be approved.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P48_S2	We recorded a charge of $5.0 million related to the upfront licensing fee.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	During 2011, we recorded a $12.8 million charge to reflect the increased risk associated with our southern European receivables, primarily Greece.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	Interest expense was $9.8 million, $4.4 million and $3.1 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P50_S1	The $5.4 million increase in interest expense for 2013 resulted primarily from a higher average debt balance as compared to the prior year and higher average interest rates due to the issuance in October 2013 of $600.0 million of 2.875% fixed-rate unsecured senior notes.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P50_S2	The $1.3 million increase in interest expense for 2012 resulted primarily from higher average interest rates and a higher average debt balance as compared to the prior year.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	Interest income was $4.6 million, $4.8 million and $3.4 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P51_S1	The $0.2 million decrease in interest income for 2013 resulted primarily from lower average interest rates, partially offset by higher average investment balances.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P51_S2	The $1.4 million increase in interest income for 2012 resulted primarily from the recognition of interest income on discounted accounts receivables in southern Europe, partially offset by lower average interest rates.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	The foreign exchange losses relate to the foreign currency fluctuations in our global trade and intercompany receivable and payable balances, offset by the gains and losses on derivative instruments intended as an economic hedge of those exposures.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	The loss (gain) on investments in unconsolidated affiliates primarily represents our net share of gains and losses in investments accounted for under the equity method, and realized gains and losses on our available-for-sale and cost method investments.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	In September 2009, we sold our hemofiltration product line.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P54_S1	In connection with the transaction, we were entitled to earn-out payments up to $9.0 million based on certain revenue objectives to be achieved by the buyer over the two years following the sale.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P54_S2	As of March 31, 2011, all earn-out payments had been earned.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	Our effective income tax rates for 2013, 2012 and 2011 were impacted as follows (in millions):
1099800_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	Certain previously reported amounts in the above table have been reclassified to conform to our current year presentation.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions was $127.7 million and $113.6 million, respectively.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P57_S1	We estimate that these liabilities would be reduced by $30.9 million and $26.1 million, respectively, from offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes and timing adjustments.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P57_S2	The net amounts of $96.8 million and $87.5 million, respectively, if not required, would favorably affect our effective tax rate.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest, penalties and foreign exchange, is as follows (in millions):
1099800_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P59_S1	As of December 31, 2013, we had accrued $4.5 million (net of $3.3 million tax benefit) of interest related to uncertain tax positions, and as of December 31, 2012, we had accrued $3.1 million (net of $2.1 million tax benefit) of interest related to uncertain tax positions.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P59_S2	During 2013, 2012 and 2011, we recognized interest expense, net of tax benefit, of $1.4 million, $1.0 million and $0.4 million, respectively, in " Provision for Income Taxes " on the consolidated statements of operations.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	We strive to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P60_S1	While we have accrued for matters we believe are more likely than not to require settlement, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P60_S2	Furthermore, we may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise our right to appeal.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	The uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation, regulations or case law.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P61_S1	Management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from these uncertain tax positions.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	At December 31, 2013, all material state, local and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2006.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	During the third quarter of 2013, the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") completed its fieldwork for the 2009 and 2010 tax years.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P63_S1	The case is currently in suspense pending finalization of an Advance Pricing Agreement ("APA") and Joint Committee of Taxation approval.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	The IRS began its examination of the 2011 and 2012 tax years during the fourth quarter of 2013.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P64_S1	We have also entered into an APA process between the Switzerland and the United States governments for the years 2009 through 2013 covering transfer pricing matters.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P64_S2	These transfer pricing matters are significant to our consolidated financial statements, and the final outcome of the negotiations between the two governments is uncertain.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P64_S3	Management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result for our uncertain tax positions.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	The federal research credit expired on December 31, 2011 and was not reinstated until January 2, 2013.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P65_S1	Accordingly, the effective income tax rate for 2012 was calculated without an assumed benefit for the federal research credit.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P65_S2	The effective income tax rate for 2013 included (1) an $8.4 million benefit for the full year 2012 federal research credit and (2) $31.3 million of tax expense associated with the $83.6 million litigation award received from Medtronic, Inc. in February 2013.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	We have received tax incentives in Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Singapore and Switzerland.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P66_S1	The tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rates favorably impacted earnings per diluted share for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 by $0.44, $0.39 and $0.40, respectively.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P66_S2	The Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Singapore and Switzerland grants provide our manufacturing operations partial or full exemption from local taxes until the years 2028, 2030 (subject to review beginning in 2015), 2024 and 2015, respectively.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	Our sources of cash liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, amounts available under credit facilities and cash from operations.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P67_S1	We believe that these sources are sufficient to fund the current requirements of working capital, capital expenditures and other financial commitments for the next twelve months.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P67_S2	However, we periodically consider various financing alternatives and may, from time to time, seek to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P67_S3	We believe that we have the financial flexibility to attract long-term capital to fund short-term and long-term growth objectives.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P67_S4	However, no assurances can be given that such long-term capital will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	We believe that cash held in the United States, in addition to amounts available under credit facilities and cash from operations, are sufficient to fund our United States operating requirements.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside the United States have historically been used to fund international operations and acquire businesses outside of the United States, although a portion of those amounts may from time to time be subject to temporary intercompany loans into the United States.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P69_S1	As of December 31, 2013, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside the United States were $811.7 million.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	United States relates to undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries which are considered by us to be indefinitely reinvested.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P70_S1	Repatriations of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside the United States are subject to restrictions in certain jurisdictions and may be subject to withholding and other taxes.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P70_S2	The potential tax liability related to any repatriation would be dependent on the facts and circumstances that exist at the time such repatriation is made and the complexities of the tax laws of the United States and the respective foreign jurisdictions.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	We have a Credit Facility which provides up to an aggregate of $750.0 million in borrowings in multiple currencies.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P71_S1	In October 2013, we issued $600.0 million of 2.875% fixed-rate unsecured senior notes due October 15, 2018.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P71_S2	The proceeds from the Notes of $597.0 million were used to repay all amounts outstanding under our Credit Facility and the remainder will be used for general corporate purposes.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	From time to time, we repurchase shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P72_S1	We consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, expected dilution from stock plans, cash capacity and the market price of our common stock.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	The current $750.0 million program provides for repurchases through December 31, 2016.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P73_S1	Under this stock repurchase authorization, in November 2013 and February 2014, we entered into Rule 10b5-1 plans to repurchase, during the period January through April 2014, up to an aggregate total of $300.0 million of our common stock in accordance with certain pre-defined price parameters.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P73_S2	During 2013, we repurchased a total of 6.8 million shares at an aggregate cost of $495.1 million, and as of December 31, 2013, had remaining authority to purchase $502.5 million of our common stock.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	Net cash flows provided by operating activities of $472.7 million for 2013 increased $110.6 million from 2012 due primarily to (1) the receipt of $83.6 million from Medtronic, Inc. in satisfaction of the April 2010 jury award of damages for infringement of the U.S. Andersen transcatheter heart valve patent, (2) increased collection of accounts receivable and (3) improved operating performance.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P74_S1	These increases were partially offset by (1) a $22.7 million increase in inventory purchases to support future product launches and (2) a $17.0 million impact from excess tax benefits from stock plans, primarily as a result of the realization of excess tax benefits that had been previously unrealized due to credit carryforwards and net operating losses in the United States in 2011 and 2012.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	Net cash flows provided by operating activities of $362.1 million for 2012 increased $53.9 million from 2011 due primarily to (1) improved operating performance, (2) a decrease in inventory builds in comparison to the prior year and (3) increased collection of accounts receivable, particularly a $26.3 million non-recurring collection in Spain and the sale of our Greek bonds.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P75_S1	These increases were partially offset by (1) a $50.5 million impact from increased excess tax benefits from stock plans, primarily the realization of excess tax benefits that had been previously unrealized due to credit carryforwards and net operating losses in the United States, and (2) the timing of supplier payments.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	Net cash used in investing activities of $412.7 million in 2013 consisted primarily of net purchases of short-term investments of $296.8 million and capital expenditures of $109.0 million.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P77_S0	Net cash used in investing activities of $78.8 million in 2012 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $109.0 million and a $36.6 million payment associated with the acquisition of BMEYE, B.V. (see Note 5 to the " Consolidated Financial Statements "), partially offset by net proceeds from short-term investments of $69.7 million.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P78_S0	Net cash provided by financing activities of $34.9 million in 2013 consisted primarily of net proceeds from debt of $409.6 million, the excess tax benefit from stock plans of $73.5 million (including the realization of previously unrealized excess tax benefits), and proceeds from stock plans of $45.5 million, partially offset by repurchases of common stock of $496.9 million.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P79_S0	Net cash used in financing activities of $155.6 million in 2012 consisted primarily of repurchases of common stock of $353.2 million, partially offset by proceeds from stock plans of $100.1 million, the excess tax benefit from stock plans of $56.5 million (including the realization of previously unrealized excess tax benefits), and net proceeds from debt of $39.5 million.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P80_S0	A summary of all of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2013 were as follows (in millions):
1099800_14_ITEM7_P81_S0	The amount included in "Less Than 1 Year" reflects anticipated contributions to our various pension plans.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P81_S1	Anticipated contributions beyond one year are not determinable.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P81_S2	The total accrued benefit liability for our pension plans recognized as of December 31, 2013 was $42.7 million.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P81_S3	This amount is impacted by, among other items, pension expense funding levels, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and investment return on plan assets.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P81_S4	Therefore, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid, and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P81_S5	See Note 11 to the " Consolidated Financial Statements " for further information.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P82_S0	(b) Contractual development obligations consist primarily of cash that we are obligated to pay upon achievement of product development and other milestones.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P82_S1	(c) Capital commitment obligations consist primarily of cash that we are obligated to pay to our limited partnership and limited liability corporation investees.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P82_S2	These investees make equity investments in various development stage biopharmaceutical and medical device companies, and it is not certain if and/or when these payments will be made.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P82_S3	(d) As of December 31, 2013, the liability for uncertain tax positions including interest was $135.5 million.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P83_S0	We have entered into an APA process between the Switzerland and the United States governments for the years 2009 through 2013 covering transfer pricing matters.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P83_S1	These transfer pricing matters are significant to our consolidated financial statements, and the final outcome of the negotiations between the two governments is uncertain.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P83_S2	Management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result for our uncertain tax positions.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P83_S3	We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid, and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P84_S0	Our results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of our accounting policies, as discussed in the notes to the " Consolidated Financial Statements ".
1099800_14_ITEM7_P85_S0	Principles in the United States ("GAAP").
1099800_14_ITEM7_P85_S1	In evaluating our transactions, management assesses all relevant GAAP and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P86_S0	The application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P86_S1	These matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain, and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P86_S2	Management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements, using historical experience and all available information.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P86_S3	We also use outside experts where appropriate.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P87_S0	We apply estimation methodologies consistently from year to year.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P88_S0	We believe the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P89_S0	When we recognize revenue from the sale of our products, we record an estimate of various sales returns and allowances which reduces product sales and accounts receivable.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P89_S1	These adjustments include estimates for rebates, returns and other sales allowances.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P89_S2	These provisions are estimated based upon historical payment experience, historical relationship to revenues, estimated customer inventory levels, and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P89_S3	Product returns are not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P89_S4	If the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not approximate future activity, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be impacted.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P90_S0	In addition, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P90_S1	For these transactions, we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P90_S2	Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect the estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P91_S0	Our primary sales adjustment relates to distributor rebates which are given to our United States distributors and represents the difference between our sales price to the distributor (at our distributor "list price") and the negotiated price to be paid by the end-customer.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P91_S1	We validate the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from our distributors or an estimate of the distributor's inventory.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P91_S2	This distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P91_S3	We periodically monitor current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the credit for future distributor rebates is fairly stated.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P92_S0	The valuation of our inventory requires us to estimate excess, obsolete and expired inventory.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P92_S1	We base our provisions for excess, obsolete and expired inventory on our estimates of forecasted net sales.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P92_S2	A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional allowances for excess, obsolete and expired inventory in the future.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P92_S3	In addition, our industry is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P92_S4	Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls, increasing levels of consigned inventory and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess, obsolete and expired inventory.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P93_S0	We capitalize certain legal costs related to the defense and enforcement of issued patents for which success is deemed probable.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P94_S0	are difficult to predict, and may not be known for prolonged periods of time, and therefore the determination to capitalize these costs is a matter of significant judgment.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P95_S0	We acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations and asset purchases.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P95_S1	The acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value, which is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P95_S2	The determination of fair value requires significant estimates, including, but not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate used to discount those cash flows, the assessment of the asset's life cycle, including the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects, and the consideration of legal, technical, regulatory, economic, and competitive risks.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P96_S0	Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to IPR D acquired in business combinations, are reviewed for impairment annually, or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P96_S1	Additionally, management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and long-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P96_S2	The impairment reviews require significant estimates about fair value, including estimation of future cash flows, selection of an appropriate discount rate, and estimates of long-term growth rates.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P97_S0	The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P97_S1	Realization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P97_S2	Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P98_S0	We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P98_S1	Our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P98_S2	These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income amongst various tax jurisdictions.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P98_S3	We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P98_S4	Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P98_S5	We review these tax uncertainties quarterly and adjust the liability as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as the progress of tax audits, lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation, regulations or case law.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P99_S0	We measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards based on estimated fair values.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P100_S0	Stock-based awards consist of stock options, restricted stock units, market-based restricted stock units and employee stock purchase subscriptions.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P100_S1	The fair value of each option award and employee stock purchase subscription is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P100_S2	The fair value of market-based restricted stock units is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which uses multiple input variables to determine the probability of satisfying the market condition requirements.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P100_S3	The Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo models require various highly judgmental assumptions, including stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected option term.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P100_S4	Stock-based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P100_S5	Judgment is required in estimating the stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited.
1099800_14_ITEM7_P101_S0	If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets, including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We manage these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	In addition to available cash and cash from operations, we use debt to finance business activities.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We are exposed to interest rate risk on our debt obligations.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P1_S2	As of December 31, 2013, we had $600.0 million of Notes outstanding that carry a fixed rate and also had available a $750.0 million Credit Facility that carries a variable interest rate based on the London interbank offered rate ("LIBOR").
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P1_S3	As of December 31, 2013, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	To diversify our interest rate risk, we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300.0 million.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The critical terms of the swaps match the critical terms of $300.0 million of the debt issuance, effectively converting that portion of the fixed-rate issue to a floating variable rate based on a 6 month LIBOR benchmark.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Based on our year end 2013 variable debt levels, a hypothetical 10% increase in our weighted-average interest rate would have an immaterial effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P3_S1	As of December 31, 2013, a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixed-rate debt by a decrease or increase of approximately $6.0 million, respectively.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P3_S2	This hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixed-rate debt.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P4_S1	These risks include the translation of local currency balances and results of our non-United States subsidiaries into United States dollars, currency gains and losses related to intercompany and third-party transactions denominated in currencies other than a location's functional currency, and currency gains and losses associated with intercompany loans.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P4_S2	Our principal currency exposures relate to the Euro and the Japanese yen.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P4_S3	Our objective is to minimize the volatility of our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and the use of derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options contracts.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P4_S4	We do not hedge our exposure related to our net investments in our non-United States subsidiaries.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P4_S5	The total notional amounts of our derivative financial instruments entered into for foreign currency management purposes at December 31, 2013 and 2012 were $805.5 million and $779.0 million, respectively.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P4_S6	A hypothetical 10% increase/decrease in the value of the United States dollar against all hedged currencies would increase/decrease the fair value of these derivative contracts by $55.3 million and $59.4 million, respectively.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P4_S7	Any gains or losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions and would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Derivative financial instruments involve credit risk in the event the financial institution counterparty should default.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P5_S1	It is our policy to execute such instruments with major financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P5_S2	At December 31, 2013, all derivative financial instruments were with bank counterparties assigned investment grade ratings by national rating agencies.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P5_S3	We further diversify our derivative financial instruments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P5_S4	We have not experienced a counterparty default and do not anticipate any non-performance by our current derivative counterparties.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P6_S0	We invest excess cash in bank time deposits and diversify the investments between financial institutions.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P7_S0	In the normal course of business, we provide credit to customers in the health care industry, perform credit evaluations of these customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses which have historically been adequate compared to actual losses.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P7_S1	In 2013, we had no customers that represent 10% or more of our total net sales or accounts receivable, net.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P8_S0	We continue to do business with foreign governments in certain European countries that have experienced a deterioration in credit and economic conditions.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P8_S1	These conditions have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a reduction in value and an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect accounts receivable outstanding in these countries.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P8_S2	In addition, we may also be impacted by declines in sovereign credit ratings or sovereign defaults in these countries.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P9_S0	During 2011, we recorded a $12.8 million charge to reflect the increased risk associated with our Southern European receivables, primarily Greece.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P9_S1	A significant further decline in sovereign credit ratings or a debt default in these Southern European countries may decrease the likelihood that we will collect these accounts receivable, which could result in a negative impact to our operating results.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P9_S2	As of December 31, 2013, our accounts receivables, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, from customers in certain European countries were $104.7 million.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P10_S0	We are exposed to investment risks related to changes in the fair values of our investments.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P10_S1	We invest in equity instruments of public and private companies.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P10_S2	These investments are classified in " Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates " on the consolidated balance sheets.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P11_S0	As of December 31, 2013, we had $21.9 million of investments in equity instruments of other companies and had recorded unrealized gains of $0.3 million on these investments in " Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss ," net of tax.
1099800_14_ITEM7A_P11_S1	Should these companies experience a decline in financial condition or fail to meet certain development milestones, the decline in the investments' values may be considered other than temporary and impairment charges may be necessary.
1099800_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
1099800_14_ITEM9A_P0_S1	The Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of December 31, 2013.
1099800_14_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Based on their evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded as of December 31, 2013 that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective in providing reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1099800_14_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1099800_14_ITEM9A_P2_S1	The Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
1099800_14_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1099800_14_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Based on that evaluation, the Company's management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2013.
1099800_14_ITEM9A_P3_S2	The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.
1099800_14_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1099800_14_ITEM9A_P4_S1	There have been no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the Company's fourth fiscal quarter of 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

1099800_14_ITEM15_P18_S0	In connection with the Annual Report of Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (the "Company") on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof (the "Report"), we, Michael A.

Ullem, Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, certify, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that:

1099800_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	For the Years Ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012:
1099800_15_ITEM8_P1_S0	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Edwards Lifesciences Corporation:
1099800_15_ITEM8_P2_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Edwards Lifesciences Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P2_S1	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1099800_15_ITEM8_P2_S2	The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting under Item 9A.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P2_S3	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P2_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1099800_15_ITEM8_P2_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P2_S6	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P2_S7	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P2_S8	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P2_S9	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P3_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P3_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P4_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P4_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P5_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P6_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P7_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P8_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P9_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P10_S0	Edwards Lifesciences Corporation ("Edwards Lifesciences" or the "Company") conducts operations worldwide and is managed in the following geographical regions: United States, Europe, Japan, and Rest of World.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P10_S1	Edwards Lifesciences is focused on technologies that treat structural heart disease and critically ill patients.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P10_S2	The products and technologies provided by Edwards Lifesciences are categorized into the following main areas:
1099800_15_ITEM8_P10_S3	Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy, Surgical Heart Valve Therapy, and Critical Care.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P11_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Edwards Lifesciences and its majority-owned subsidiaries.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P11_S1	All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P12_S0	The Company reviews its investments in other entities to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity ("VIE").
1099800_15_ITEM8_P12_S1	The Company would be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, and would be required to consolidate the VIE, if it has the power to direct the significant activities of the entity and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entity that may be significant to the VIE.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P12_S2	Based on the Company's analysis, it determined it is not the primary beneficiary of any VIEs; however, future events may require VIEs to be consolidated if the Company becomes the primary beneficiary.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P13_S0	Due to the Company's change in accounting principle (see Note 3), certain legal costs previously reported on the consolidated statements of operations in " Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses " and " Special Charges " have been reclassed to " Intellectual Property Litigation (Income) Expense, net " to conform to the current year presentation.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P13_S1	In addition, certain reclassifications related to the presentation of income taxes and special charges have been made in the prior years' consolidated statements of cash flows to conform to the current year presentation.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P13_S2	These reclassifications had no impact on net income or on the cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P14_S0	The consolidated financial statements of Edwards Lifesciences have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") which have been applied consistently in all material respects.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P14_S1	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P14_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P15_S0	When the local currency of the Company's foreign entities is the functional currency, all assets and liabilities are translated into United States dollars at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P15_S1	Income and expense items are translated at the weighted-average exchange rate prevailing during the period.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P16_S0	The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P17_S0	Revenue is considered realized or realizable and earned upon delivery of the product, provided that an agreement of sale exists, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P17_S1	In the case of certain products where the Company maintains consigned inventory at customer locations, revenue is recognized at the time the customer has used the inventory.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P18_S0	The Company's principal sales terms provide for title and risk of loss transferring upon delivery to the customer, limited right of return, and no unusual provisions or conditions.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P18_S1	When the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products, an estimate of various sales returns and allowances is recorded which reduces product sales and accounts receivable.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P18_S2	These adjustments include estimates for rebates, returns, and other sales allowances.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P18_S3	These provisions are estimated and recorded at the time of sale based upon historical payment experience, historical relationship to revenues, estimated customer inventory levels, and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P18_S4	Other than in limited circumstances, product returns are not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P18_S5	In addition, the Company may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P18_S6	For these transactions, the Company defers recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount of product to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P19_S0	The Company's sales adjustment related to distributor rebates given to the Company's United States distributors represents the difference between the Company's sales price to the distributor (at the Company's distributor "list price") and the negotiated price to be paid by the end-customer.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P19_S1	This distributor rebate is recorded by the Company as a reduction to sales and a reduction to the distributor's accounts receivable at the time of sale to a distributor.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P19_S2	The Company validates the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from its distributors or an estimate of its distributor's inventory.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P19_S3	This distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P19_S4	The Company periodically monitors current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the credit for future distributor rebates is fairly stated.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P20_S0	The Company also offers volume rebates to certain group purchasing organizations ("GPOs") and customers based upon target sales levels.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P20_S1	For volume rebates offered to GPOs, the rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and an obligation to the GPO, as the Company expects to pay in cash.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P20_S2	For volume rebates offered to customers, the rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and accounts receivable, as the Company expects a net payment from the customer.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P20_S3	The provision for volume rebates is estimated based on customers' contracted rebate programs and historical experience of rebates paid.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P20_S4	The Company periodically monitors its customer rebate programs to ensure that the allowance and liability for accrued rebates is fairly stated.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P21_S0	The Company considers highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P21_S1	These investments are valued at cost, which approximates fair value.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P22_S0	The Company invests its excess cash in fixed-rate debt securities, including time deposits, commercial paper, U.S. government and agency securities, municipal securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, and municipal securities.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P22_S1	Investments with maturities of one year or less are classified as short-term, and investments with maturities greater than one year are classified as long-term.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P22_S2	Investments that the Company has the ability and intent to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P22_S3	The Company determines the appropriate classification of its investments in fixed-rate debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation at each balance sheet date.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P23_S0	The Company also has long-term equity investments in companies that are in various stages of development.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P23_S1	Certain of these investments are designated as available-for-sale.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P23_S2	Other investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for under the cost or the equity method of accounting, as appropriate.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P24_S0	The Company accounts for investments in limited partnerships or limited liability corporations, whereby the Company owns a minimum of 5% of the investee's outstanding voting stock, under the equity method of accounting.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P24_S1	These investments are recorded at the amount of the Company's investment and adjusted each period for the Company's share of the investee's income or loss and dividends paid.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P24_S2	As investments accounted for under the cost method do not have readily determinable fair values, the Company only estimates fair value if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that could have a significant adverse effect on the investment's fair value.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P25_S0	The Company periodically reviews its investments for impairment.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P25_S1	When the fair value of an investment declines below cost, management uses the following criteria to determine if such a decline should be considered other-than-temporary and result in a recognized loss:
1099800_15_ITEM8_P26_S0	the duration and extent to which the market value has been less than cost; the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee/issuer; the reasons for the decline in market value; the Company's ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value; and the investee's performance against product development milestones.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P27_S0	The Company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer-specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P28_S0	allowances for doubtful accounts related to receivables from customers in certain European countries that have historically paid beyond the stated terms, the Company's analysis considers a number of factors including evidence of the customer's ability to comply with credit terms, economic conditions, and procedures implemented by the Company to collect the historical receivables.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P28_S1	Additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances, if economic conditions are less favorable than the Company has anticipated, or for customer-specific circumstances, such as financial difficulty.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P28_S2	The allowance for doubtful accounts was $11.3 million and $12.2 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P29_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market value.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P29_S1	Market value for raw materials is based on replacement costs, and for other inventory classifications is based on net realizable value.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P30_S0	A write-down for excess or inactive inventory is recorded for inventory which is obsolete, nearing its expiration date (generally triggered at six months prior to expiration), is damaged, or slow moving (generally defined as quantities in excess of a two-year supply).
1099800_15_ITEM8_P30_S1	The allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was $32.2 million and $29.6 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P31_S0	The Company allocates to inventory general and administrative costs that are related to the production process.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P31_S1	These costs include insurance, manufacturing accounting personnel, human resources personnel, and information technology.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P31_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, the Company allocated $29.1 million, $25.9 million, and $26.2 million, respectively, of general and administrative costs to inventory.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P31_S3	General and administrative costs included in inventory at December 31, 2014 and 2013 were $17.5 million and $15.0 million, respectively.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P32_S0	At December 31, 2014 and 2013, approximately $46.2 million and $40.0 million, respectively, of the Company's finished goods inventories were held on consignment.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P33_S0	Property, plant, and equipment are recorded at cost.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P33_S1	Depreciation is principally calculated for financial reporting purposes on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from 10 to 40 years for buildings and improvements, from 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment, and from 3 to 10 years for software.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P33_S2	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the related facility leases or the asset, whichever is shorter.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P33_S3	Straight-line and accelerated methods of depreciation are used for income tax purposes.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P34_S0	Depreciation expense for property, plant, and equipment was $57.5 million, $53.1 million, and $44.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P34_S1	Repairs and maintenance expense was $25.9 million, $21.7 million, and $20.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P35_S0	Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P36_S0	the assets and liabilities, including existing goodwill, to those reporting units.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P36_S1	The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based on the Company's market capitalization and a market revenue multiple.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P36_S2	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, then the Company measures the amount of the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P36_S3	In 2014, 2013, and 2012, the Company did not record any impairment loss as the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its respective carrying value.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P37_S0	Indefinite-lived intangible assets relate to in-process research and development ("IPR D") acquired in business combinations.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P37_S1	The estimated fair values of IPR D projects acquired in a business combination which have not reached technological feasibility are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P37_S2	Upon successful completion of the project, the capitalized amount is amortized over its estimated useful life.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P37_S3	If the project is abandoned, all remaining capitalized amounts are written off immediately.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P38_S0	Indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually, or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P38_S1	An impairment loss is recognized when the asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P39_S0	IPR D projects acquired in an asset acquisition are expensed unless the project has an alternative future use.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P40_S0	Management reviews the carrying amounts of other finite-lived intangible assets and long-lived tangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P40_S1	Impairment indicators include, among other conditions, cash flow deficits, historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit, and adverse legal or regulatory developments.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P40_S2	If it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable, based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization periods, their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P41_S0	Estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P41_S1	For the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment, long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P42_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P42_S1	The Company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and adjusting the amount, if necessary.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P42_S2	The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are both historical experience and the Company's forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P42_S3	Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the Company's effective tax rate on future earnings.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P43_S0	When assessing whether a windfall tax benefit relating to stock-based compensation has been realized, the Company follows the with and without approach, under which the windfall benefit is recognized only if an incremental benefit is provided after considering all other tax attributes presently available to the Company.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P43_S1	Consideration is given only to the direct impacts of stock awards when calculating the amount of windfalls and shortfalls.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P44_S0	The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P45_S0	The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that a position would more likely than not be sustained based upon its technical merit if challenged by the relevant taxing authority and taken by management to the court of last resort.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P45_S1	For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the relevant tax authority.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P46_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P47_S0	Research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P48_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average common shares outstanding during a period.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P48_S1	Employee equity share options, nonvested shares, and similar equity instruments granted by the Company are treated as potential common shares in computing diluted earnings per share.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P48_S2	Diluted shares outstanding include the dilutive effect of restricted stock units, market-based restricted stock units, and in-the-money options.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P49_S0	The dilutive impact of the restricted stock units, market-based restricted stock units, and in-the-money options is calculated based on the average share price for each fiscal period using the treasury stock method.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P49_S1	Under the treasury stock method, the amount that the employee must pay for exercising stock options, the amount of compensation expense for future service that the Company has not yet recognized, and the amount of tax benefits that would be recorded in " Additional Paid-in Capital " when the award becomes deductible are assumed to be used to repurchase shares.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P49_S2	Potential common share equivalents have been excluded where their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P50_S0	The table below presents the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (in millions, except for per share information):
1099800_15_ITEM8_P51_S0	respectively, were outstanding, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P52_S0	The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based awards based on estimated fair values.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P52_S1	Stock-based awards consist of stock options, restricted stock units, market-based restricted stock units, and employee stock purchase subscriptions.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P52_S2	Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period (vesting period) on a straight-line basis.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P52_S3	Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P53_S0	Upon exercise of stock options or vesting of restricted stock units and market-based restricted stock units, the Company issues common stock.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P54_S0	Total stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 was as follows (in millions):
1099800_15_ITEM8_P55_S0	Upon retirement, all unvested stock options are immediately forfeited.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P55_S1	In addition, upon retirement, a participant will immediately vest in 25% of restricted stock units for each full year of employment with the Company measured from the grant date.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P55_S2	All remaining unvested restricted stock units are immediately forfeited.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P56_S0	For market-based restricted stock units, upon retirement and in certain other specified cases, a participant will receive a pro-rated portion of the shares that would ultimately be issued based on attainment of the performance goals as determined on the vesting date.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P56_S1	The pro-rated portion is based on the participant's whole months of service with the Company during the performance period prior to the date of termination.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P57_S0	The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate and foreign currency risks.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P57_S1	It is the Company's policy not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P58_S0	The Company uses interest rate swaps to convert a portion of its fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P58_S1	These interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges and meet the shortcut method requirements under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P58_S2	Accordingly, changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P58_S3	The Company uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the changes due to currency rate movements in the amount of future cash flows associated with intercompany transactions and certain third-party expenses expected to occur within the next 13 months.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P58_S4	These foreign currency forward exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedges.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P59_S0	The Company uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to offset the transaction gains and losses associated with certain of these assets and liabilities.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P59_S1	All foreign currency forward exchange contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries, principally the Euro and the Japanese yen.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P60_S0	All derivative financial instruments are recognized at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P60_S1	For each derivative instrument that is designated and effective as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized immediately to earnings, and offsets the loss or gain on the underlying hedged item.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P60_S2	The gain or loss on fair value hedges is classified in net interest expense, as they hedge the interest rate risk associated with the Company's fixed-rate debt.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P61_S0	The Company reports in " Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss " the effective portion of the gain or loss on derivative financial instruments that are designated, and that qualify, as cash flow hedges.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P61_S1	The Company reclassifies these gains and losses into earnings in the same period in which the underlying hedged transactions affect earnings.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P61_S2	Any hedge ineffectiveness (which represents the amount by which the changes in fair value of the derivative exceed the variability in the cash flows of the forecasted transaction) is recorded in current period earnings.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P61_S3	During 2014, 2013, and 2012, the Company did not record any gains or losses due to hedge ineffectiveness.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P61_S4	The gains and losses on derivative financial instruments for which the Company does not elect hedge accounting treatment are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in each period based upon the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P61_S5	Cash flows from derivative financial instruments are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P62_S0	Derivative financial instruments involve credit risk in the event the counterparty should default.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P62_S1	It is the Company's policy to execute such instruments with global financial institutions that the Company believes to be creditworthy.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P62_S2	The Company diversifies its derivative financial instruments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P62_S3	The Company also uses International Swap Dealers Association master-netting agreements.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P62_S4	Under the master-netting agreements, the Company's counterparty settlement risk is the net amount of any receipts or payments due between the Company and the counterparty financial institution.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P63_S0	In July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an amendment to the accounting guidance on income taxes impacting the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P63_S1	The guidance requires an entity to net its unrecognized tax benefits against the deferred tax assets for all same jurisdiction net operating loss or similar tax loss carryforwards, or tax credit carryforwards.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P63_S2	The guidance was effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2013 and interim periods therein.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P63_S3	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P64_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued an update to the accounting guidance on revenue recognition.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P64_S1	The new guidance provides a comprehensive, principles-based approach to revenue recognition, and supersedes most previous revenue recognition guidance.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P65_S0	The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P65_S1	The guidance also requires improved disclosures on the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P66_S0	The new guidance can be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of the change recognized at the date of the initial application.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P66_S1	The Company is currently assessing the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements, and has not yet selected a transition method.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P67_S0	Effective January 1, 2014, the Company changed its method of accounting for certain intellectual property litigation expenses related to the defense and enforcement of its issued patents.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P67_S1	Previously, the Company capitalized these legal costs if a favorable outcome in the patent defense was determined to be probable, and amortized the capitalized legal costs over the life of the related patent.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P67_S2	As of December 31, 2013, the Company had remaining unamortized capitalized legal costs of $23.7 million, which, under the previous accounting method, would have been amortized through 2021.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P67_S3	Under the new method of accounting, these legal costs are expensed in the period they are incurred.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P67_S4	The Company has retrospectively adjusted the comparative financial statements of prior periods to apply this new method of accounting.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P68_S0	The Company believes this change in accounting principle is preferable because (1) as more competitors enter the Company's key product markets and the threat of complex intellectual property litigation across multiple jurisdictions increases, it will become more difficult for the Company to accurately assess the probability of a favorable outcome in such litigation, and (2) it will enhance the comparability of the Company's financial results with those of its peer group because it is the predominant accounting practice in the Company's industry.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P69_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes have been adjusted to reflect the impact of this change retrospectively to all prior periods presented.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P69_S1	The cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle was a decrease in retained earnings of $10.5 million as of January 1, 2012.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P69_S2	The following tables present the effects of the retrospective application of the change in accounting principle (in millions):
1099800_15_ITEM8_P70_S0	The above amounts also reflect certain reclassifications of previously reported amounts to conform to classifications used in the current year.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P70_S1	See Note 2 for further information.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P71_S0	In May 2014, the Company entered into an agreement with Medtronic, Inc. and its affiliates ("Medtronic") to settle all outstanding patent litigation between the companies, including all cases related to transcatheter heart valves.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P71_S1	Pursuant to the agreement, all pending cases or appeals in courts and patent offices worldwide have been dismissed, and the parties will not litigate patent disputes with each other in the field of transcatheter valves for the eight-year term of the agreement.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P71_S2	Under the terms of a patent cross-license that is part of the agreement, Medtronic made a one-time, upfront payment to the Company in the amount of $750.0 million.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P71_S3	In addition, Medtronic will pay the Company quarterly license royalty payments through April 2022.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P71_S4	For sales in the United States, the royalty payments will be based on a percentage of Medtronic's sales of transcatheter aortic valves, subject to a minimum annual payment of $40.0 million and a maximum annual payment of $60.0 million.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P71_S5	A separate royalty payment will be calculated based on sales of Medtronic transcatheter aortic valves manufactured in the United States but sold elsewhere.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P72_S0	The Company accounted for the settlement agreement as a multiple-element arrangement and allocated the total consideration to the identifiable elements based upon their relative fair value.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P72_S1	The consideration assigned to each element was as follows (in millions):

1099800_15_ITEM8_P153_S0	acquired to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock issued to employees.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P154_S0	The timing and size of any future stock repurchases are subject to a variety of factors, including market conditions, stock prices, and other cash requirements.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P155_S0	During 2013 and 2012, the Company entered into ASR agreements providing for the repurchase of the Company's common stock based on the volume-weighted average price ("VWAP") of the Company's common stock during the terms of the agreements, less a discount.

1099800_15_ITEM8_P156_S0	The ASR agreements were accounted for as two separate transactions: (a) the value of the initial delivery of shares was recorded as shares of common stock acquired in a treasury stock transaction on the acquisition date and (b) the remaining amount of the purchase price paid was recorded as a forward contract indexed to the Company's own common stock and was recorded in " Additional Paid-in Capital " on the consolidated balance sheets.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P157_S0	The initial delivery of shares resulted in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted-average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P157_S1	The Company determined that the forward contract indexed to the Company's common stock met all the applicable criteria for equity classification and, therefore, was not accounted for as a derivative instrument.

1099800_15_ITEM8_P158_S5	The actual number of shares issued will be determined based on the Company's total shareholder return relative to a selected industry peer group over a three-year performance period, and may range from 0% to 175% of the targeted number of shares granted.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P158_S6	On May 8, 2014, an amendment and restatement of the Program was approved by the Company's stockholders.

1099800_15_ITEM8_P159_S4	Additionally, each nonemployee director may elect to receive all or a portion of the annual cash retainer to which the director is otherwise entitled through the issuance of stock options or restricted shares.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P159_S5	Each option received as a deferral of the cash retainer immediately vests on the grant date, and each restricted share award vests after one year.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P160_S0	Upon a director's initial election to the Board, the director receives an initial grant of stock options equal to a fair market value on grant date of $0.2 million, not to exceed 10,000 shares.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P160_S1	These grants vest over three years from the date of grant.

1099800_15_ITEM8_P162_S2	Under the ESPP, employees can authorize the Company to withhold up to 12% of their compensation for common stock purchases, subject to certain limitations.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P163_S0	The ESPP is available to all active employees of the Company paid from the United States payroll and to eligible employees of the Company outside the United States, to the extent permitted by local law.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P163_S1	The ESPP for United States employees is qualified under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P163_S2	The number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the ESPP was 6.9 million shares.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P164_S0	The fair value of each option award and employee stock purchase subscription is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the assumptions noted in the following tables.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P164_S1	The risk-free interest rate is estimated using the U.S. Treasury yield curve and is based on the expected term of the award.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P164_S2	Expected volatility is estimated based on a blend of the weighted-average of the historical volatility of Edwards Lifesciences' stock and the implied volatility from traded options on Edwards Lifesciences' stock.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P164_S3	The expected term of awards granted is estimated from the vesting period of the award, as well as historical exercise behavior, and represents the period of time that awards granted are expected to be outstanding.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P165_S0	The Company uses historical data to estimate forfeitures and has estimated an annual forfeiture rate of 5.4%.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P166_S0	The Black-Scholes option pricing model was used with the following weighted-average assumptions for options granted during the following periods:
1099800_15_ITEM8_P167_S0	The Black-Scholes option pricing model was used with the following weighted-average assumptions for ESPP subscriptions granted during the following periods:
1099800_15_ITEM8_P168_S0	The fair value of market-based restricted stock units was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which uses multiple input variables to determine the probability of satisfying the market condition requirements.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P168_S1	The weighted-average assumptions used to determine the fair value of the market-based restricted stock units during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 included a risk-free interest rate of 0.9%, 0.4%, and 0.3%, respectively, and an expected volatility rate of 31.7%, 33.4%, and 30.4%, respectively.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P169_S0	Stock option activity during the year ended December 31, 2014 under the Program and the Nonemployee Directors Program was as follows (in millions, except years and per-share amounts):

1099800_15_ITEM8_P183_S0	During 2014, net deferred tax assets increased $41.9 million, including items that were recorded to stockholders' equity and which did not impact the Company's income tax provision.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P184_S0	The valuation allowance of $47.7 million as of December 31, 2014 reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P184_S1	This allowance primarily relates to the net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards of certain United States and non-United States subsidiaries, and to the deferred tax assets established for impairment losses on certain investments and for certain non-United States credit carryforwards.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P185_S0	A valuation allowance of $2.6 million has been provided for other-than-temporary impairments and unrealized losses related to certain investments that may not be recognized due to the uncertainty of the ready marketability of certain impaired investments.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P186_S0	Net operating loss carryforwards and the related carryforward periods at December 31, 2014 are summarized as follows (in millions):
1099800_15_ITEM8_P187_S0	Tax credit carryforwards and the related carryforward periods at December 31, 2014 are summarized as follows (in millions):
1099800_15_ITEM8_P188_S0	The Company has $52.5 million of California research expenditure tax credits it expects to use in future periods.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P188_S1	The credits may be carried forward indefinitely.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P188_S2	Based upon anticipated future taxable income, the Company expects that it is more likely than not that all California research expenditure tax credits will be utilized, although the utilization of the full benefit is expected to occur over a number of years and into the far distant future.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P188_S3	Accordingly, no valuation allowance has been provided.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P189_S0	The United States state net operating loss carryforwards include $2.7 million of losses attributable to windfall stock option deductions.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P189_S1	A net benefit of $0.2 million will be recorded to " Additional Paid-in Capital " when realized as a reduction to income taxes payable.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P190_S0	Approximately $7.7 million of the total $52.5 million California research expenditure tax credit carryforwards are attributable to windfall stock option deductions and will be recorded as a benefit to " Additional Paid-in Capital " when realized as a reduction to income taxes payable.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P191_S0	Deferred income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries of approximately $1,652.8 million as of December 31, 2014 since these amounts are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P191_S1	It is not practicable to calculate the deferred taxes associated with these earnings because of the variability of multiple factors that would need to be assessed at the time of any assumed repatriation; however, foreign tax credits would likely be available to reduce federal income taxes in the event of distribution.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P191_S2	In making this assertion, the Company evaluates, among other factors, the profitability of its United States and foreign operations and the need for cash within and outside the United States, including cash requirements for capital improvement, acquisitions, market expansion, and stock repurchase programs.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P191_S3	The Company does not expect any earnings for certain of its foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and records the tax impact in net income currently.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P192_S0	The Company has received tax incentives in Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Singapore, and Switzerland.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P193_S0	The Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Singapore and Switzerland grants provide the Company's manufacturing operations partial or full exemption from local taxes until the years 2028, 2030 (subject to review beginning in 2015), 2024, and 2015, respectively.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P194_S0	A reconciliation of the United States federal statutory income tax rate to the Company's effective income tax rate is as follows (in millions):
1099800_15_ITEM8_P195_S0	The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 included (1) $262.1 million of tax expense associated with a $750.0 million litigation settlement payment received from Medtronic in May 2014 (see Note 4) and (2) $4.8 million of tax benefits from the remeasurement of uncertain tax positions.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P196_S0	The federal research credit expired on December 31, 2011 and was reinstated on January 2, 2013.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P196_S1	As a result, the effective income tax rates for the year ended December 31, 2012 was calculated without a benefit for the federal research credit.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P196_S2	The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 included (1) an $8.4 million benefit for the full year 2012 federal research credit and (2) $31.3 million of tax expense associated with the $83.6 million litigation award received from Medtronic in February 2013 (see Note 4).
1099800_15_ITEM8_P197_S0	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions was $192.3 million and $127.7 million, respectively.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P197_S1	The Company estimates that these liabilities would be reduced by $34.3 million and $30.9 million, respectively, from offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes, and timing adjustments.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P197_S2	The net amounts of $158.0 million and $96.8 million, respectively, if not required, would favorably affect our effective tax rate.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P198_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest, penalties, and foreign exchange, is as follows (in millions):
1099800_15_ITEM8_P199_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P199_S1	As of December 31, 2014, the Company had accrued $6.8 million (net of $5.0 million tax benefit) of interest related to uncertain tax positions, and as of December 31, 2013, the Company had accrued $4.5 million (net of $3.3 million tax benefit) of interest related to uncertain tax positions.

1099800_15_ITEM8_P200_S0	The Company strives to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P200_S1	While the Company has accrued for matters it believes are more likely than not to require settlement, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P200_S2	Furthermore, the Company may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise its right to appeal.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P200_S3	The uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues, and issuance of new legislation, regulations, or case law.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P200_S4	Management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from these uncertain tax positions.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P201_S0	At December 31, 2014, all material state, local, and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2008.

1099800_15_ITEM8_P202_S1	The case is currently in suspense pending finalization of an Advance Pricing Agreement ("APA") and Joint Committee of Taxation approval.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P203_S0	The IRS began its examination of the 2011 and 2012 tax years during the fourth quarter of 2013.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P204_S0	The Company has entered into an APA process between the Switzerland and the United States governments for the years 2009 through 2015 covering transfer pricing matters.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P204_S1	These transfer pricing matters are significant to the Company's consolidated financial statements, and the final outcome of the negotiations between the two governments is uncertain.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P205_S0	During 2014, the Company also filed with the IRS a request for a pre-filing agreement associated with a tax return filing position on a portion of the litigation settlement payment received from Medtronic in May 2014 (see Note 4).
1099800_15_ITEM8_P206_S0	Management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result for our uncertain tax positions.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P206_S1	Based upon the information currently available and numerous possible outcomes, the Company cannot reasonably estimate what, if any, changes in its existing uncertain tax positions may occur in the next 12 months and thus has recorded the gross uncertain tax positions as a long-term liability.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P206_S2	However, if the APA and/or pre-filing agreement is finalized in the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that these events could result in a significant change in the Company's uncertain tax positions within the next 12 months.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P207_S0	Edwards Lifesciences is or may be a party to, or may otherwise be responsible for, pending or threatened lawsuits related primarily to products and services currently or formerly manufactured or performed, as applicable, by Edwards Lifesciences.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P207_S1	Such cases and claims raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the facts and circumstances of each particular case or claim, the jurisdiction in which each suit is brought, and differences in applicable law.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P207_S2	Upon resolution of any such legal matter or other claim, Edwards Lifesciences may incur charges in excess of established reserves.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P207_S3	The Company is not able to estimate the amount or range of any loss for legal contingencies for which there is no reserve or additional loss for matters already reserved.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P207_S4	While any such charge related to matters could have a material adverse impact on Edwards Lifesciences' net income or cash flows in the period in which it is recorded or paid, management does not believe that any such charge relating to any currently pending lawsuit would have a material adverse effect on Edwards Lifesciences' financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
1099800_15_ITEM8_P208_S0	Edwards Lifesciences is subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside of the United States.

1099800_15_ITEM1_P55_S0	Patents and other proprietary rights are important to the success of our business.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P55_S1	We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing innovations, and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P56_S0	We own more than 2,500 issued United States patents, pending United States patent applications, issued foreign patents, and pending foreign patent applications.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P56_S1	We also have licensed various United States and foreign patents and patent applications that relate to aspects of the technology incorporated in certain of our products, including our heart valves and annuloplasty rings.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P56_S2	We also own or have rights in United States and foreign patents and patent applications in the field of transcatheter heart valve repair and replacement.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P56_S3	In addition, we own or have rights in United States and foreign patents and patent applications that cover catheters, systems and methods for hemodynamic monitoring, and vascular access products.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P57_S0	We are a party to several license agreements with unrelated third parties pursuant to which we have obtained, for varying terms, the exclusive or non-exclusive rights to certain patents held by such third parties in consideration for cross-licensing rights and/or royalty payments.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P57_S1	We have also licensed certain patent rights to others.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P58_S0	We monitor the products of our competitors for possible infringement of our owned and licensed patents.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P58_S1	Litigation has been necessary to enforce certain patent rights held by us, and we plan to continue to defend and prosecute our rights with respect to such patents.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P59_S0	We own certain United States registered trademarks used in our business.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P59_S1	Many of our trademarks have also been registered for use in certain foreign countries where registration is available and where we have determined it is commercially advantageous to do so.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P60_S0	Our products and facilities are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, including the U.S. FDA, European Community Notified Bodies, and the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, to confirm compliance to the various laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, and distribution of our products.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P60_S1	We are also governed by federal, state, local, and international laws of general applicability, such as those regulating employee health and safety and the protection of the environment.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P60_S2	Overall, the amount and scope of domestic and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our business is increasing.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P61_S0	In the United States, the FDA has responsibility for regulating medical devices.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P61_S1	The FDA regulates design, development, testing, clinical studies, manufacturing, labeling, promotion, and record keeping for medical devices, and reporting of adverse events, recalls, or other field actions by manufacturers and users to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P61_S2	Many of the devices that we develop and market are in a category for which the FDA has implemented stringent clinical investigation and pre-market clearance or approval requirements.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P62_S0	The process of obtaining FDA clearance or approval to market a product is resource intensive, lengthy, and costly.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P62_S1	FDA review may involve substantial delays that adversely affect the marketing and sale of our products.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P62_S2	A number of our products are pending regulatory clearance or approval to begin commercial sales in various markets.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P62_S3	Ultimately, the FDA may not authorize the commercial release of a medical device if it determines the device is not safe and effective or does not meet other standards for clearance.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P62_S4	Additionally, even if a product is cleared or approved, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of these products once commercialized.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P63_S0	The FDA has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order the repair, replacement, or refund of the costs of such devices, or preclude the importation of devices that are or appear violative.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P63_S1	The FDA also conducts inspections to determine compliance with the quality system regulations concerning the manufacturing and design of devices and current medical device reporting regulations, recall regulations, clinical testing regulations, and other requirements.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P63_S2	The FDA may withdraw product clearances or approvals due to failure to comply with regulatory standards, or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval, and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P63_S3	Additionally, the failure to comply with FDA or comparable regulatory standards or the discovery of previously unknown product problems could result in fines, delays, or suspensions of regulatory clearances or approvals, seizures, injunctions, recalls, refunds, civil money penalties, or criminal prosecution.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P63_S4	Our compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P63_S5	Moreover, the FDA and several other United States agencies administer controls over the export of medical devices from the United States and the import of devices into the United States, which could also subject us to sanctions for noncompliance.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P64_S0	In May 2013, we received a warning letter from the Denver District Office of the FDA resulting from an inspection of our facility in Draper, Utah.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P64_S1	The warning letter relates specifically to the execution of our quality systems at the Utah facility, including design and process validation, corrective and preventive actions, finished device acceptance, and packaging, and indicated that we would not receive pre-market approvals for devices reasonably related to those issues until the issues are resolved.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P65_S0	Our Utah facility manufactures devices such as cannulae and cardioplegia catheters, heart valve repair rings, and transcatheter heart valve delivery system components and accessories.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P65_S1	We are actively implementing the necessary actions to resolve these issues identified in the letter.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P65_S2	In June 2014, we were granted a variance from the FDA through June 15, 2015 for the SAPIEN XT delivery systems and components that are manufactured at the Draper facility.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P66_S0	variance, we are complying with an agreed upon action plan for the SAPIEN XT delivery system that verifies the safety and effectiveness of its intended use.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P67_S0	We are also subject to additional laws and regulations that govern our business operations, products, and technologies, including:
1099800_15_ITEM1_P68_S0	federal, state, and foreign anti-kickback laws and regulations, which generally prohibit payments to physicians or other purchasers of medical products as an inducement to purchase a product; the Stark law, which prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to a provider that bills these programs for the provision of certain designated health services if the physician (or a member of the physician's immediate family) has a financial relationship with that provider; federal and state laws and regulations that protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient records, and restrict the use and disclosure of such information, in particular, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996; the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires public disclosure of the financial relationships of United States physicians and teaching hospitals with applicable manufacturers, including medical device, pharmaceutical, and biologics companies; the False Claims Act, which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claims for payment to a federally funded health care program, and health care fraud statutes that prohibit false statements and improper claims to any third-party payor; and the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which can be used to prosecute companies in the United States for arrangements with foreign government officials or other parties outside the United States.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P69_S0	Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal liability, significant fines or penalties, negative publicity, and substantial costs and expenses associated with investigation and enforcement activities.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P70_S0	To assist in our compliance efforts, we adhere to many codes of ethics and conduct regarding our sales and marketing activities in the United States and other countries in which we operate.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P70_S1	In addition, we have in place a dedicated team to improve our internal business compliance programs and policies.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P71_S0	Internationally, the regulation of medical devices is complex.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P71_S1	In Europe, our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P71_S2	The regulatory regime in the European Union for medical devices became mandatory in June 1998.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P71_S3	It requires that medical devices may only be placed on the market if they do not compromise safety and health when properly installed, maintained, and used in accordance with their intended purpose.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P72_S0	National laws conforming to the European Union's legislation regulate our products under the medical devices regulatory system.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P72_S1	Although the more variable national requirements under which medical devices were formerly regulated have been substantially replaced by the European Union Medical Devices Directive, individual nations can still impose unique requirements that may require supplemental submissions.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P73_S0	The European Union medical device laws require manufacturers to declare that their products conform to the essential regulatory requirements after which the products may be placed on the market bearing the CE Mark.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P73_S1	Manufacturers' quality systems for products in all but the lowest risk classification are also subject to certification and audit by an independent notified body.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P74_S0	In Europe, particular emphasis is being placed on more sophisticated and faster procedures for the reporting of adverse events to the competent authorities.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P75_S0	In Japan, pre-market approval and clinical studies are required as is governmental pricing approval for medical devices.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P75_S1	Clinical studies are subject to a stringent "Good Clinical Practices" standard.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P75_S2	Approval time frames from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare vary from simple notifications to review periods of one or more years, depending on the complexity and risk level of the device.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P75_S3	In addition, importation of medical devices into Japan is subject to the "Good Import Practices" regulations.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P75_S4	As with any highly regulated market, significant changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect future sales.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P76_S0	In many of the other foreign countries in which we market our products, we may be subject to regulations affecting, among other things:
1099800_15_ITEM1_P77_S0	product standards and specifications; packaging requirements; labeling requirements; product collection and disposal requirements; quality system requirements; import restrictions; tariffs; duties; and tax requirements.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P78_S0	Many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the FDA.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P78_S1	In some regions, the level of government regulation of medical devices is increasing, which can lengthen time to market and increase registration and approval costs.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P79_S0	In many countries, the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed and considered eligible for reimbursement.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P80_S0	Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs, including price regulation and competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness reviews, technology assessments, and managed-care arrangements, are continuing in many countries where we do business, including the United States, Europe, and Japan.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P80_S1	As a result of these changes, the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical therapies.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P80_S2	For example, government programs, private health care insurance, and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by restricting coverage and limiting the level of reimbursement for procedures or treatments, and some third-party payors require their pre-approval before new or innovative devices or therapies are utilized by patients.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P80_S3	These various initiatives have created increased price sensitivity over medical products generally and may impact demand for our products and technologies.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P81_S0	The delivery of our products is subject to regulation by the Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") in the United States and comparable state and foreign agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P81_S1	Foreign governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P82_S0	Reimbursement schedules regulate the amount the United States government will reimburse hospitals and doctors for the inpatient care of persons covered by Medicare.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P82_S1	HHS' Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services ("CMS") may also review whether and/or under what circumstances a procedure or technology is reimbursable for Medicare beneficiaries.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P83_S0	Several legislative proposals in the United States have been advanced that would restrict future funding increases for government-funded programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P83_S1	Changes in current reimbursement levels could have an adverse effect on market demand and our pricing flexibility.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P84_S0	Health care cost containment efforts have also prompted domestic hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power, and this trend is expected to continue.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P84_S1	The medical device industry has also experienced some consolidation, partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P84_S2	As a result, transactions with customers are larger, more complex and tend to involve more long-term contracts than in the past.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P84_S3	These larger customers, due to their enhanced purchasing power, may attempt to increase the pressure on product pricing.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P85_S0	In 2010, significant reforms to the health care system were adopted as law in the United States.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P85_S1	The law includes provisions that, among other things, reduce or limit Medicare reimbursement, require all individuals to have health insurance (with limited exceptions), and impose increased taxes.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P85_S2	Specifically, the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize health care reform in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on United States sales of most medical devices.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P85_S3	The excise tax increased our operating expenses.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P85_S4	Because other parts of the 2010 health care law remain subject to continued implementation, the long-term impact on us is uncertain.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P85_S5	This law or any future legislation could reduce medical procedure volumes, lower reimbursement for our products, and impact the demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P86_S0	Our quarterly net sales are influenced by many factors, including new product introductions, acquisitions, regulatory approvals, patient and physician holiday schedules, and other factors.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P86_S1	Net sales in the third quarter are typically lower than other quarters of the year due to the seasonality of the United States and European markets, where summer vacation schedules normally result in fewer medical procedures.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P87_S0	As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately 9,100 employees worldwide, the majority of whom were located in the United States, the Dominican Republic, Singapore, and Puerto Rico.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P87_S1	Other major concentrations of employees are located in Europe and Japan.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P88_S0	We emphasize competitive compensation, benefits, equity participation, and a positive and attractive work environment in our efforts to attract and retain qualified personnel, and employ a rigorous talent management system.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P88_S1	None of our North American employees are represented by a labor union.
1099800_15_ITEM1_P88_S2	In various countries outside of North America, we interact with trade unions and work councils that represent a limited number of employees.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our business and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	An investor should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P0_S3	If any of these events or circumstances occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be materially harmed.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P0_S4	In that case, the value of our securities could decline and an investor could lose part or all of his or her investment.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P0_S5	In addition, forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws that are contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in our other filings or statements may be subject to the risks described below as well as other risks and uncertainties.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P0_S6	Please read the cautionary notice regarding forward-looking statements in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," below.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our products may become obsolete and our operating results may suffer.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The cardiovascular products industry is characterized by technological changes, frequent new product introductions, and evolving industry standards.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Without the timely introduction of new and improved products, our products could become technologically obsolete or more susceptible to competition and our revenue and operating results would suffer.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Even if we are able to develop new or improved products, our ability to market them could be limited by the need for regulatory clearance, restrictions imposed on approved indications, entrenched patterns of clinical practice, uncertainty over third-party reimbursement, or other factors.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P2_S3	We devote significant financial and other resources to our research and development activities; however, the research and development process is prolonged and entails considerable uncertainty.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Accordingly, products we are currently developing may not complete the development process or obtain the regulatory or other approvals required to market such products in a timely manner or at all.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Technical innovations often require substantial time and investment before we can determine their commercial viability.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We may not have the financial resources necessary to fund all of these projects.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P3_S2	In addition, even if we are able to successfully develop new or improved products, they may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development, and they may be rendered obsolete or less competitive by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products with newer technologies or features or other factors.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We may incur product liability losses that could adversely affect our operating results.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, and marketing of medical devices.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P5_S2	In addition, many of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects, or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, patients.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Such a problem could result in product liability lawsuits and claims, safety alerts, or product recalls in the future, which, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and ability to attract and retain customers.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Product liability claims may be brought from time to time either by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We may incur charges related to such matters in excess of any established reserves and such charges, including the establishment of any such reserves, could have a material adverse impact on our net income and net cash flows.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We may experience supply interruptions that could harm our ability to manufacture products.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We use a broad range of raw and organic materials and other items in the design and manufacture of our products.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Our Surgical and Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy products are manufactured from treated natural animal tissue and man-made materials.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Our non-implantable products are manufactured from man-made raw materials including resins, chemicals, electronics, and metals.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P9_S3	We purchase certain of the materials and components used in the manufacture of our products from external suppliers, and we purchase certain supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance, cost-effectiveness, availability, or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P9_S4	General economic conditions could adversely affect the financial viability of our suppliers, resulting in their inability to provide materials and components used in the manufacture of our products.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P9_S5	While we work closely with suppliers to monitor their financial viability, assure continuity of supply, and maintain high quality and reliability, these efforts may not be successful.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P9_S6	In addition, due to the rigorous regulations and requirements of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products (including the need for approval of any change in supply arrangements), we may have difficulty establishing additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or at all if the need arises.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P9_S7	Although alternative supplier options are considered and identified, we typically do not pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships and the time and expense associated with the regulatory validation process.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P9_S8	A change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to product performance or incorporate unique technology, and the loss of any existing supply contract could have a material adverse effect on us.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Regulatory agencies in the United States or other international geographies from time to time have limited or banned the use of certain materials used in the manufacture of our products.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	In these circumstances, transition periods typically provide time to arrange for alternative materials.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	In addition, the SEC enacted disclosure rules regarding products that may contain certain minerals that originate from conflict areas in and around the Democratic Republic of Congo.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P10_S3	If our suppliers cannot verify that their components do not originate from these conflict areas, we may need to source components from alternative suppliers.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P10_S4	If we are unable to identify alternative materials or suppliers and secure approval for their use in a timely manner, our business could be harmed.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Some of our suppliers are located outside the United States.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	As a result, trade or regulatory embargoes imposed by foreign countries or the United States could result in delays or shortages that could harm our business.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	If we or one of our suppliers encounters manufacturing or quality problems, including as a result of natural disasters, our business could suffer.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls, due in part to rigorous regulatory requirements.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	In addition, quality is extremely important due to the serious and costly consequences of a product failure.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Problems can arise during the manufacturing process for a number of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow protocols and procedures, raw material problems, or human error.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P13_S3	If these problems arise or if we otherwise fail to meet our internal quality standards or those of the FDA or other applicable regulatory body, which include detailed record-keeping requirements, our reputation could be damaged, we could become subject to a safety alert or a recall, we could incur product liability and other costs, product approvals could be delayed, and our business could otherwise be adversely affected.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	In addition, our manufacturing facilities in California, Utah, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico could be materially damaged by earthquakes, hurricanes, and other natural disasters or catastrophic circumstances.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	While we believe that our exposure to significant losses from a catastrophic disaster could be partially mitigated by our ability to manufacture some of our products at our other manufacturing facilities, the losses could have a material adverse effect on our business for an indeterminate period of time before this manufacturing transition is complete and operates without significant disruption.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We may be required, from time to time, to recognize charges in connection with the write-down of our asset or business dispositions, or for other reasons.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	From time to time, we identify businesses and products that are not performing at a level commensurate with the rest of our business.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We may seek to dispose of these underperforming businesses or products.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We may also seek to dispose of other businesses or products for strategic or other business reasons.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P16_S3	If we cannot dispose of a business or product on acceptable terms, we may voluntarily cease operations related to that business or product.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Any of these events could result in charges, which could be substantial and which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We may not successfully identify and complete acquisitions or strategic alliances on favorable terms or achieve anticipated synergies relating to any acquisitions or alliances, and such acquisitions could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, require significant management resources, and require significant charges or write-downs.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We regularly explore potential acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies, services, or products, as well as potential strategic alliances.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates or appropriate partners with which to form alliances.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Even if we identify appropriate acquisition or alliance candidates, we may be unable to complete the acquisitions or alliances on favorable terms, if at all.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P18_S3	In addition, the process of integrating an acquired business, technology, service, or product into our existing operations could result in unforeseen difficulties and expenditures.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Integration of an acquired company often requires significant expenditures as well as significant management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our other businesses.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Moreover, we may not realize the anticipated financial or other benefits of an acquisition or alliance.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We may be required to take charges or write-downs in connection with acquisitions.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	In particular, acquisitions of businesses engaged in the development of new products may give rise to in-process research and development ("IPR D") assets.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	to write down the value of the assets.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Also, in connection with certain asset acquisitions, we may be required to take an immediate charge related to acquired IPR D. Either of these situations could result in substantial charges, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Future acquisitions could also involve the issuance of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization of expenses related to other intangible assets, any of which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	In addition, equity or debt financing required for such acquisitions may not be available.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	General economic and political conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	External factors can affect our profitability and financial condition.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Such external factors include general domestic and global economic conditions, such as interest rates, tax rates, and factors affecting global economic stability, and the political environment regarding health care in general.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P23_S2	The strength and timing of the current economic recovery remains uncertain, and we cannot predict to what extent the global economic conditions may negatively impact our business.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P23_S3	For example, negative conditions in the credit and capital markets could impair our ability to access the financial markets for working capital or other funds, and could negatively impact our ability to borrow.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P23_S4	An increase in interest rates could result in an increase in our borrowing costs and could otherwise restrict our ability to access the capital markets.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Such conditions could result in decreased liquidity and impairments in the carrying value of our investments, and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P23_S6	These and other conditions could also adversely affect our customers, and may impact their ability or decision to purchase our products or make payments on a timely basis.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	In 2010, significant reforms to the health care system were adopted as law in the United States.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The law includes provisions that, among other things, reduce or limit Medicare reimbursement, require all individuals to have health insurance (with limited exceptions) and impose increased taxes.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Specifically, the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize health care reform in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on United States sales of most medical devices.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P24_S3	The excise tax increased our operating expenses.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Because other parts of the 2010 health care law remain subject to continued implementation, the long-term impact on us is uncertain.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P24_S5	This law or any future legislation, including deficit reduction legislation, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and prospects if they were to impact the demand for our products or pricing, or result in cuts to, or a restructuring of, entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our business is subject to economic, political, and other risks associated with international sales and operations, including risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Because we sell our products in a number of countries, our business is subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including risks associated with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Our net sales originating outside the United States, as a percentage of total net sales, were 55% in 2014.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P26_S2	We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P26_S3	In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the United States.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	potentially negative impact of tax laws, including transfer pricing liabilities and tax costs associated with the repatriation of cash; difficulty in staffing and managing global operations; cultural, exchange rate, or other local factors affecting financial terms with customers; local economic and financial conditions, including sovereign defaults and decline in sovereign credit ratings, affecting the collectability of receivables, including receivables from sovereign entities; an outbreak of any life-threatening communicable disease; economic and political instability and local economic and political conditions; differing labor regulations; and differing protection of intellectual property.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Substantially all of our sales outside of the United States are denominated in local currencies.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Measured in local currency, a substantial portion of our international sales was generated in Europe (and primarily denominated in the Euro) and in Japan.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P28_S2	The United States dollar value of our international sales varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Decreases in the value of the United States dollar to the Euro or the Japanese yen have the effect of increasing our reported revenues even when the volume of international sales has remained constant.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Increases in the value of the United States dollar relative to the Euro or the Japanese yen, as well as other currencies, have the opposite effect and, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our reported revenues and results of operations.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P28_S5	We have a hedging program for certain currencies that attempts to manage currency exchange rate risks to an acceptable level based on management's judgment of the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity, and cost; however, this hedging program does not completely eliminate the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act, and similar laws in other jurisdictions contain prohibitions against bribery and other illegal payments, and make it an offense to fail to have procedures in place that prevent such payments.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Recent years have seen an increasing number of investigations and other enforcement activities under these laws.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Although we have compliance programs in place with respect to these laws, which may be used as a defense to prove we had adequate procedures, no assurance can be given that a violation will not be found, and if found, the resulting penalties could adversely affect us and our business.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The stock market can be volatile and fluctuations in our quarterly sales and operating results as well as other factors could cause our financial guidance to vary from actual results and our stock price to decline.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	From time to time, the stock market experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P31_S1	This volatility can have a significant effect on the market prices of securities for reasons unrelated to underlying performance.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P31_S2	These broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect our stock price, regardless of our operating results.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P31_S3	In addition, the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in response to any of the other risk factors set out above and below, as well as a number of other factors, including the performance of comparable companies or the medical device industry, or changes in financial estimates and recommendations of securities analysts.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P32_S1	A high proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to significant selling, research and development, and manufacturing costs.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Thus, small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter, and the price of our common stock could fall.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Other factors that could affect our quarterly sales and operating results include:
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	demand for and clinical acceptance of products; the timing and execution of customer contracts, particularly large contracts that would materially affect our operating results in a given quarter; the timing of sales of products and of the introduction of new products; the timing of marketing, training, and other expenses related to the introduction of new products; the timing of regulatory approvals; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; delays or problems in introducing new products, such as slower than anticipated adoption of transcatheter heart valves; changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors; the timing of approvals of governmental reimbursement rates or changes in reimbursement rates for our products; increased expenses, whether related to sales and marketing, raw materials or supplies, product development, or administration; changes in the level of economic activity in the United States or other regions in which we do business; costs related to acquisitions of technologies or businesses; and our ability to expand our operations and the amount and timing of expansion-related expenditures.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The quarterly and full-year financial guidance we provide to investors and analysts with insight to our view of our future performance is based on assumptions about our sales and operating results.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Due to the nature of our business and the numerous factors that can impact our sales and operating performance, including those described above, our financial guidance may vary from actual results.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P34_S2	If we fail to meet any financial guidance that we provide, or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance during the year, the price of our common stock could decline.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We face intense competition, and if we do not compete effectively, our business will be harmed.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The cardiovascular medical device industry is highly competitive.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P36_S1	We compete with many companies, some of which have longer operating histories, better brand or name recognition, and broader product offerings.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Our customers consider many factors when selecting a product, including product reliability, breadth of product line, clinical outcomes, product availability, price, availability and rate of reimbursement, and services provided by the manufacturer.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P36_S3	In addition, our ability to compete will depend in large part on our ability to develop and acquire new products and technologies, anticipate technology advances, and keep pace with other developers of cardiovascular therapies and technologies.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Our sales, technical, and other key personnel play an integral role in the development, marketing, and selling of new and existing products.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	If we are unable to recruit, hire, develop, and retain a talented, competitive workforce, our ability to compete may be adversely affected.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Our competitive position can also be adversely affected by product problems, physician advisories and safety alerts, reflecting the importance of quality in the medical device industry.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Our position can shift as a result of any of these factors.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P37_S3	See " Competition " under " Business " included herein.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The health care industry has been consolidating, and organizations such as GPOs, independent delivery networks, and large single accounts, such as the United States Veterans Administration, continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for many of our health care provider customers.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	customers are larger, more complex, and tend to involve more long-term contracts.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P40_S1	The purchasing power of these larger customers has increased, and may continue to increase, causing downward pressure on product pricing.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P40_S2	If we are not one of the providers selected by one of these organizations, we may be precluded from making sales to its members or participants.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Even if we are one of the selected providers, we may be at a disadvantage relative to other selected providers that are able to offer volume discounts based on purchases of a broader range of medical equipment and supplies.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Further, we may be required to commit to pricing that has a material adverse effect on our revenues, profit margins, business, financial condition, and results of operations.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P40_S5	We expect that market demand, governmental regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide health care industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances, which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Our inability to protect our intellectual property or other sensitive company information could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our success and competitive position are dependent in part upon our proprietary intellectual property.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P42_S1	We rely on a combination of patents and trade secrets to protect our proprietary intellectual property, and we expect to continue to do so.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Although we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of means, we cannot guarantee that the protective steps we have taken are adequate to protect these rights.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged and held invalid.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P43_S1	In addition, as our patents expire, we may be unsuccessful in extending their protection through patent term extensions.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P43_S2	The expiration of, or the failure to maintain or extend our patents, could have a material adverse effect on us.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We also rely on confidentiality agreements with certain employees, consultants, and other third parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary information.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P44_S1	These agreements could be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for such a breach.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P44_S2	In addition, others could independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary information.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Our intellectual property, other proprietary technology, and other sensitive company information is potentially vulnerable to loss, damage, or misappropriation from system malfunction, computer viruses, unauthorized access to our data, or misappropriation or misuse of it by those with permitted access, and other events.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P45_S1	While we have invested to protect our intellectual property and other information, and continue to work diligently in this area, there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns, breaches, cyber-attacks, or other events.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, or results of operations.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We spend significant resources to enforce our intellectual property rights, sometimes resulting in litigation.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Intellectual property litigation is complex and can be expensive and time-consuming.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P46_S2	However, our efforts in this regard may not be successful.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P46_S3	We may not be able to detect infringement.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P46_S4	In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Patent litigation can result in substantial cost and diversion of effort.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Intellectual property protection may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, enabling our competitors to capture increased market position.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P47_S2	The invalidation of key intellectual property rights or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits filed to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or prospects.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P49_S0	During recent years, we and our competitors have been involved in substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P49_S1	From time to time, we have been and may in the future be forced to defend against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, and such intellectual property litigation is typically costly and time-consuming.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P50_S0	injunctions, or could require us to seek licenses from third parties and, if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms, prevent us from manufacturing, selling, or using certain products, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on us.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P50_S1	In addition, some licenses may be non-exclusive, which could provide our competitors access to the same technologies.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Third parties could also obtain patents that may require us to either redesign products or, if possible, negotiate licenses from such third parties.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Such licenses may materially increase our expenses.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P51_S2	If we are unable to redesign products or obtain a license, we might have to exit a particular product offering.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We and our customers are subject to rigorous governmental regulations and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products that are compatible with these regulations.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P52_S1	In addition, failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial sanctions which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The medical devices we manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities, including regulations that cover the composition, labeling, testing, clinical study, design, sourcing, manufacturing, packaging, marketing, advertising, promotion, and distribution of our products.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We are required to register with the FDA as a device manufacturer.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P54_S1	As a result, we are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA's Quality System Regulation ("QSR") requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, design, quality control, and documentation procedures.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P54_S2	The FDA may also inspect our compliance with requirements related to adverse event reporting, recalls or corrections (field actions), the conduct of clinical studies, and other requirements.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P55_S0	In the European Union, we are required to maintain certain CE Mark and ISO certifications in order to sell our products, and are subject to periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P55_S1	If we or our suppliers fail to adhere to QSR, CE Mark, ISO, or similar requirements, this could delay or interrupt product production or sales and/or lead to fines, difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances, recalls, or other consequences, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or prospects.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Medical devices must receive FDA clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the United States.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P56_S1	In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of approved products that have been commercialized, and can prevent or limit further marketing of a product based upon the results of post-marketing programs.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P56_S2	In addition, the federal Medical Device Reporting regulations require us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P56_S3	Federal regulations also require us to report certain recalls or corrective actions to the FDA.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P56_S4	Furthermore, most major markets for medical devices outside the United States require clearance, approval, or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P56_S5	The process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device, particularly from the FDA and certain foreign governmental authorities, can be costly and time-consuming, and clearances or approvals may not be granted for products or product improvements on a timely basis, if at all.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P56_S6	Delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, clearances or approvals for products or product improvements could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations or prospects.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P57_S0	At any time after approval of a product for commercial sale, the FDA may conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with QSR requirements, and/or current Medical Device Reporting regulations, or other regulatory requirements.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Noncompliance with applicable requirements may subject us or responsible individuals to sanctions including civil money penalties, product seizure, injunction, or criminal prosecution.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P57_S2	In addition, the FDA may withhold or delay pre-market approval of our products until the noncompliance is resolved.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P57_S3	Product approvals by the FDA can also be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Regulatory agencies in the United States or other international geographies from time to time limit or ban the use of certain materials used in the manufacture of our products, require collection and disposal of products at the end of their lifecycle, and require disclosure of the origin of certain raw materials in our products.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Noncompliance with applicable requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P59_S0	The United States Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and similar laws in other jurisdictions, also impose reporting and disclosure requirements on device, pharmaceutical, and biologics companies for certain financial relationships with United States health care providers and teaching hospitals.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Failure to submit required information or submitting incorrect information may result in significant civil monetary penalties.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We are also subject to various United States and international laws pertaining to health care pricing, anti-corruption, and fraud and abuse, including prohibitions on kickbacks and the submission of false claims laws and restrictions on relationships with physicians and other referral sources.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P60_S1	These laws are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation, which could require us to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if we are found not to be in compliance.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions against us and our officers and employees, including substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in governmental health care programs.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Despite our implementation of robust compliance processes, we may be subject, from time to time, to inspections, investigations, and other enforcement actions by governmental authorities.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P61_S1	If we are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, the applicable governmental authority can impose fines, delay, suspend, or revoke regulatory clearances or approvals, institute proceedings to detain or seize our products, issue a recall, impose marketing or operating restrictions, enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against us or our officers or employees, and institute criminal prosecution.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Moreover, governmental authorities can ban or request the recall, repair, replacement, or refund of the cost of any device or product we manufacture or distribute.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Any of the foregoing actions could result in decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P61_S4	In addition to the sanctions for noncompliance described above, commencement of an enforcement proceeding, inspection, or investigation could divert substantial management attention from the operation of our business and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Our industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities, which may lead to greater governmental regulation in the future.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P63_S0	In recent years, the medical device industry has been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny, including by the FDA, numerous other federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities, as well as members of Congress.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P63_S1	This has included increased regulation, enforcement, inspections, and governmental investigations of the medical device industry and disclosure of financial relationships with health care professionals.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P63_S2	We anticipate that the government will continue to scrutinize our industry closely, and that additional regulation by governmental authorities, both foreign and domestic, may increase compliance costs, exposure to litigation, and other adverse effects to our operations.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Unsuccessful clinical trials or procedures relating to products under development could have a material adverse effect on our prospects.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P65_S0	The regulatory approval process for new products and new indications for existing products requires extensive clinical trials and procedures, including early clinical experiences and regulatory studies.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from current or future clinical trials or procedures conducted by us, our competitors, or third parties, or perceptions regarding this clinical data, could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary approvals and the market's view of our future prospects.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P65_S2	Such clinical trials and procedures are inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that these trials or procedures will be completed in a timely or cost-effective manner or result in a commercially viable product.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P66_S0	these trials or procedures in a timely and cost-effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our prospects.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Clinical trials or procedures may experience significant setbacks even after earlier trials have shown promising results.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Further, preliminary results from clinical trials or procedures may be contradicted by subsequent clinical analysis.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P67_S2	In addition, results from our clinical trials or procedures may not be supported by actual long-term studies or clinical experience.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P67_S3	If preliminary clinical results are later contradicted, or if initial results cannot be supported by actual long-term studies or clinical experience, our business could be adversely affected.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P67_S4	Clinical trials or procedures may be suspended or terminated by us, the FDA or other regulatory authorities at any time if it is believed that the trial participants face unacceptable health risks.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Certain of our products, including pericardial tissue valves, are manufactured using bovine tissue.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Concerns relating to the potential transmission of BSE, commonly known as "mad cow disease," from cows to humans may result in reduced acceptance of products containing bovine materials.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Certain medical device regulatory agencies have considered whether to continue to permit the sale of medical devices that incorporate bovine material.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P70_S0	We obtain bovine tissue only from closely controlled sources within the United States and Australia.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P70_S1	The bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valves is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility for the suspected BSE infectious agent.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P70_S2	We have not experienced any significant adverse impact on our sales as a result of concerns regarding BSE, but no assurance can be given that such an impact may not occur in the future.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P71_S0	If third-party payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or impose other cost containment measures to reduce reimbursement levels, our ability to profitably sell our products will be harmed.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P72_S0	We sell our products and technologies to hospitals, doctors, and other health care providers, all of which receive reimbursement for the health care services provided to patients from third-party payors, such as government programs (both domestic and international), private insurance plans, and managed care programs.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P72_S1	The ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products from private and governmental third-party payors is critical to the success of medical technology companies.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P72_S2	The availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P72_S3	Reimbursement varies from country to country and can significantly impact acceptance of new products.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P73_S1	There can be no assurance that levels of reimbursement, if any, will not be decreased in the future, or that future legislation, regulation, or reimbursement policies of third-party payors will not otherwise adversely affect the demand for and price levels of our products.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P74_S0	The introduction of cost containment incentives, combined with closer scrutiny of health care expenditures by both private health insurers and employers, has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Hospitals or physicians may respond to such cost-containment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other therapies.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P74_S2	In addition, the 2010 United States health care law could adversely affect reimbursement levels for our products, or otherwise adversely affect our product pricing and profitability.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs, including price regulation, are underway in several countries around the world.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P75_S1	In many countries, customers are reimbursed for our products under a government operated insurance system.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P75_S2	Under such a system, the government periodically reviews reimbursement levels and may limit patient access.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P75_S3	If a government were to decide to reduce reimbursement levels, our product pricing could be adversely affected.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods as determined by such third-party payors, or was used for an unapproved indication.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P76_S1	Third-party payors may also deny reimbursement for experimental procedures and devices.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P77_S0	one-time cost may be significant, because they are intended to reduce overall health care costs over a long period of time.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P77_S1	We cannot be certain that these third-party payors will recognize these cost savings instead of merely focusing on the lower initial costs associated with competing therapies.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P77_S2	If our products are not considered cost-effective by third-party payors, our customers may not be reimbursed for them, resulting in lower sales of our products.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Use of our products in unapproved circumstances could expose us to liabilities.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P79_S0	The marketing approval from the FDA and other regulators of certain of our products are, or are expected to be, limited to specific indications.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P79_S1	We are prohibited by law from marketing or promoting any unapproved use of our products.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P79_S2	Physicians, however, can use these products in ways or circumstances other than those strictly within the scope of the regulatory approval.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P79_S3	Although the product training we provide to physicians and other health care professionals is limited to approved uses or for clinical trials, no assurance can be given that claims might not be asserted against us if our products are used in ways or for procedures that are not approved.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Our operations are subject to environmental, health, and safety regulations that could result in substantial costs.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Our operations are subject to environmental, health, and safety laws, and regulations concerning, among other things, the generation, handling, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes, the cleanup of hazardous substance releases, and emissions or discharges into the air or water.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P81_S1	We have incurred and may incur expenditures in the future in connection with environmental, health and safety laws, and regulations.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P81_S2	New laws and regulations, violations of these laws or regulations, stricter enforcement of existing requirements, or the discovery of previously unknown contamination could require us to incur costs or could become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could be material.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P82_S0	The success of many of our products depends upon strong relationships with certain key physicians.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P83_S0	The development, marketing, and sale of many of our products requires us to maintain working relationships with physicians upon whom we rely to provide considerable knowledge and experience.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P83_S1	These physicians may assist us as researchers, marketing consultants, product trainers and consultants, inventors, and as public speakers.
1099800_15_ITEM1A_P83_S2	If new laws, regulations, or other developments limit our ability to maintain strong relationships with these professionals or to continue to receive their advice and input, the development and marketing of our products could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
1099800_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	The locations and uses of our major properties are as follows:
1099800_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	The Irvine, California property has one lease that expires in 2016 and one that expires in 2021; the Dominican Republic property leases expire in 2019; the Puerto Rico property has one lease that expires in 2016 and one that expires in 2018; the Horw, Switzerland lease expires in 2016; the Tokyo, Japan lease expires in 2015; and Singapore has one land lease that expires in 2036 and one that expires in 2041.
1099800_15_ITEM2_P2_S0	We believe our properties have been well maintained, are in good operating condition, and are adequate for current needs.
1099800_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	For a description of our material pending legal proceedings, please see Note 17 to the " Consolidated Financial Statements " of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated by reference.
1099800_15_ITEM5_P0_S0	The principal market for our common stock is the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE").
1099800_15_ITEM5_P0_S1	The table below sets forth, for the calendar quarters indicated, the high and low closing prices of our common stock as reported by the NYSE.
1099800_15_ITEM5_P1_S0	On February 10, 2015, there were 15,961 stockholders of record of our common stock.
1099800_15_ITEM5_P2_S0	We have never paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends.
1099800_15_ITEM5_P2_S1	Our current policy is to retain any future earnings for use in our business.
1099800_15_ITEM5_P3_S0	On May 14, 2013, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to purchase on the open market, including pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, and in privately negotiated transactions up to $750.0 million of our common stock from time to time until December 31, 2016.
1099800_15_ITEM5_P3_S1	On July 10, 2014, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program providing for an additional $750.0 million of repurchases of our common stock.
1099800_15_ITEM5_P3_S2	We did not purchase any of our common stock during the fourth quarter of 2014 and, as of December 31, 2014, we had remaining authority to purchase $952.5 million of common stock.
1099800_15_ITEM5_P4_S0	The following graph compares the performance of our common stock with that of the S P 500 Index and the S P 500 Healthcare Equipment Index.
1099800_15_ITEM5_P4_S1	The cumulative total return listed below assumes an initial investment of $100 on December 31, 2009 and reinvestment of dividends.
1099800_15_ITEM6_P0_S0	The financial data for the prior years presented in the table below have been restated to reflect our change in accounting principle.
1099800_15_ITEM6_P1_S0	The above results include special charges of $70.7 million, $16.3 million, and $16.0 million during 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
1099800_15_ITEM6_P1_S1	In addition, the above results include $750.0 million ($487.9 million, net of tax) in 2014 for an upfront payment received under a litigation settlement agreement, and $83.6 million ($52.3 million, net of tax) received in 2013 for a litigation award.
1099800_15_ITEM6_P1_S2	See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations " and Note 4 and Note 5 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information.
1099800_15_ITEM6_P1_S3	(b) In October 2013, we issued $600.0 million of 2.875% fixed-rate unsecured senior notes due October 15, 2018 ("the Notes").
1099800_15_ITEM6_P2_S0	At December 31, 2010, all amounts outstanding under the credit agreement in effect at that time were classified as short-term obligations as these obligations were due within one year.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis presents the factors that had a material effect on our results of operations during the three years ended December 31, 2014.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P0_S1	Also discussed is our financial position as of December 31, 2014.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P0_S2	You should read this discussion in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	We are the global leader in the science of heart valves and hemodynamic monitoring.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	Driven by a passion to help patients, we partner with clinicians to develop innovative technologies in the areas of structural heart disease and critical care monitoring, enabling them to save and enhance lives.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P1_S2	We conduct operations worldwide and are managed in the following geographical regions: United States, Europe, Japan, and Rest of World.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P1_S3	Our products are categorized into the following main areas:
1099800_15_ITEM7_P1_S4	Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy, Surgical Heart Valve Therapy, and Critical Care.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	Effective January 1, 2014, we changed our method of accounting for certain intellectual property litigation expenses related to the defense and enforcement of our issued patents.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	then amortized over the life of the related patent.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	The financial results below reflect the change in accounting principle.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	The following is a summary of our financial performance (dollars in millions, except per share data):
1099800_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	transcatheter heart valve, and in the United States, benefited from the launch of the Edwards SAPIEN XT transcatheter heart valve.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	Our gross profit margin was negatively impacted in 2014 by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, increased incentive compensation due to our strong performance, and higher manufacturing costs, primarily for our operations in Utah.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	Net income in 2014 and 2013 benefited from special items.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	In 2014, we received $750.0 million ($487.9 million, net of tax) from Medtronic, Inc. ("Medtronic") for an upfront payment due under a litigation settlement agreement, and in 2013, we received from Medtronic an $83.6 million ($52.3 million, net of tax) litigation award.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	The medical device industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	Our success is measured both by the development of innovative products and the value we bring to our stakeholders.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P8_S2	We are committed to developing new technologies and providing innovative patient care, and we are committed to defending our intellectual property.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P8_S3	To strengthen our leadership and enable future growth opportunities, in 2014 we invested 14.9% of our net sales in research and development.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P8_S4	In a consolidating industry, we believe our focus on innovation and a robust product pipeline will continue to help us compete more effectively, sustain our successes, and build long-term value for our shareholders.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P8_S5	The following is a summary of important developments during 2014:
1099800_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	early clinical outcomes in the Edwards SAPIEN 3 Trial demonstrated outstanding safety, including a low mortality and stroke rate; longer-term updates from The PARTNER Trial strengthened the evidence that patients treated with the SAPIEN valve demonstrated a mortality benefit, persistent symptom benefit, and a statistically significant reduction in re-hospitalizations compared with standard therapy; we received regulatory approval in Europe for our SAPIEN 3 valve; we received regulatory approval in the United States for our Edwards SAPIEN XT valve, and we continued to evaluate the SAPIEN 3 valve as part of the PARTNER II Trial; and we received regulatory approval in Europe for the Edwards INTUITY Elite Valve System , and in the United States, this valve platform has been studied as part of the TRANSFORM Trial.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	Three-year clinical outcomes of the Edwards INTUITY valve platform studied in the TRITON Trial demonstrated improved cardiac and valvular performance, as well as patient functional status.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	We are dedicated to generating robust clinical and economic evidence increasingly expected by patients, clinicians, and payors in the new healthcare environment, with the goal of enhancing the value of delivering comprehensive care.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	The $107.7 million increase in net sales in the United States in 2014 was due primarily to:
1099800_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy, which increased net sales by $85.1 million, due primarily to (1) commercial sales of the Edwards SAPIEN XT transcatheter heart valve resulting from the product launch in June 2014, (2) an increase in clinical sales of the Edwards SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve, (3) royalties received under a license agreement with Medtronic (see Note 4 to the " Consolidated Financial Statements "), and (4) the reversal of the sales reserve for estimated Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy product returns upon delivery of next-generation valves.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	The introduction of the next-generation valves was completed in 2014.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P12_S2	These increases were partially offset by decreased sales of the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve as customers converted to Edwards SAPIEN XT, a reduction in net stocking orders as customers converted from direct sales to consignment, and decreased clinical sales of Edwards SAPIEN XT ; Critical Care, which increased net sales by $12.9 million, due primarily to enhanced surgical recovery products; and Surgical Heart Valve Therapy, which increased net sales by $9.9 million, driven primarily by sales of pericardial aortic tissue valves.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	The $169.7 million increase in international net sales in 2014 was due primarily to:
1099800_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $23.0 million, due to the weakening of various currencies against the United States dollar, mainly the Japanese yen, partially offset by the strengthening of the Euro against the United States dollar.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	The $127.5 million increase in net sales in the United States in 2013 was due primarily to:
1099800_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy, which increased net sales by $106.1 million, driven primarily by sales of the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	Procedure volume increased following the FDA action in October 2012 to expand the indicated patient population and access routes compared to the original 2011 approval.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	The $18.4 million increase in international net sales in 2013 was due primarily to:
1099800_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $43.9 million, due primarily to the weakening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of the Euro against the United States dollar.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net sales is not necessarily indicative of the impact on net income due to the corresponding effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on international manufacturing and operating costs, and our hedging activities.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	The $235.9 million increase in net sales of Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy products in 2014 was due primarily to:
1099800_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	lower sales of the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve, primarily in the United States, and the Edwards SAPIEN XT transcatheter heart valve in Europe, as customers converted to next-generation products.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	The $155.6 million increase in net sales of Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy products in 2013 was due primarily to:
1099800_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	a $14.1 million sales reserve for estimated Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy product returns expected in 2014 upon introduction of the Edwards SAPIEN 3 transcatheter valve system in Europe and the Edwards SAPIEN XT transcatheter heart valve in the United States.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	During the first quarter of 2014, we completed enrollment in the 500 patient cohort of The PARTNER II Trial studying the Edwards SAPIEN 3 transcatheter valve system in high risk and inoperable patients.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	In January 2014, we received FDA approval to expand The PARTNER II Trial to include a 1,000 patient single-arm, non-randomized cohort to study the Edwards SAPIEN 3 transcatheter valve system in the treatment of intermediate-risk patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P24_S2	Enrollment was completed in September 2014.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P24_S3	At the end of 2014, we submitted our pre-market approval application for SAPIEN 3 in the United States.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	In January 2014, we received CE Mark for the Edwards SAPIEN 3 transcatheter valve system in Europe.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	In June 2014, we received FDA approval for the Edwards SAPIEN XT transcatheter heart valve in the United States for the treatment of high-risk and inoperable patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	The $24.9 million increase in net sales of Surgical Heart Valve Therapy products in 2014 was due primarily to:
1099800_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $10.5 million, due to the weakening of various currencies against the United States dollar, mainly the Japanese yen, partially offset by the strengthening of the Euro against the United States dollar.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	The $13.7 million increase in net sales of Surgical Heart Valve Therapy products in 2013 was due primarily to:
1099800_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $20.2 million, due primarily to the weakening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	In April 2014, we received CE Mark for our advanced EDWARDS INTUITY Elite valve system.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	This next-generation, rapid deployment system facilitates smaller incisions in surgical aortic valve replacement procedures.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P30_S2	In the United States, we completed enrollment of patients in our TRANSFORM Trial for EDWARDS INTUITY Elite, and we continued enrolling patients in our COMMENCE clinical trial, which is studying our next-generation GLX advanced tissue platform applied to the Magna Ease aortic surgical valve and the Magna Mitral Ease valve.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	The $16.6 million increase in net sales of Critical Care products in 2014 was due primarily to enhanced surgical recovery products, and core hemodynamic products outside the United States, partially offset by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $12.0 million, due primarily to the weakening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	The $23.4 million decrease in net sales of Critical Care products in 2013 was due primarily to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $28.9 million, due primarily to the weakening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	In June 2014, we received FDA clearance for the ClearSight system, a noninvasive monitor that provides clinicians access to blood volume and blood flow information for patients at moderate or high risk of post-surgical complications, in whom invasive monitoring would not be used.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	The ClearSight system is part of our enhanced surgical recovery product portfolio.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P33_S2	In September 2014, due to a strategic shift of our investment initiatives, we decided to discontinue our automated glucose monitoring program.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	The 1.6 percentage point decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2014 was driven by:
1099800_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	a 0.8 percentage point increase due to an improved product mix in the United States, driven by Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy products.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	The 0.5 percentage point increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2013 was driven by:
1099800_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	a 1.3 percentage point decrease due primarily to higher manufacturing costs due to capacity expansion in preparation for multiple Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy product introductions.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	The $124.6 million increase in SG A expenses in 2014 was due primarily to (1) higher sales and marketing expenses in the United States, Europe, and Japan, mainly to support the Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy program, and (2) higher performance-based incentive compensation.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	The $36.0 million increase in SG A expenses in 2013 was due primarily to (1) higher sales and marketing expenses in the United States and Japan, mainly to support the Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy program and (2) the 2.3% United States medical device excise tax, or $15.8 million, which became effective in 2013.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	These increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency, which reduced expenses by $12.4 million due primarily to the weakening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P39_S2	The decrease in SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2013 was due primarily to decreased SG A expenses in Europe as a percentage of net sales.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	The increase in research and development expenses in 2014 was due primarily to new aortic and mitral Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy product development efforts, additional investments in clinical studies in the Surgical Heart Valve Therapy program, and higher performance-based incentive compensation.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	The decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales was due primarily to higher net sales.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	The increase in research and development expenses in 2013 was due primarily to additional investments in clinical studies and new product development efforts in the Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy program.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	In May 2014, we entered into an agreement with Medtronic to settle all outstanding patent litigation between the companies, including all cases related to transcatheter heart valves.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	Pursuant to the agreement, we received an upfront payment from Medtronic in the amount of $750.0 million.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	In February 2013, we received $83.6 million from Medtronic in satisfaction of the initial April 2010 jury award of damages for infringement of the United States Andersen transcatheter heart valve patent, including accrued interest.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	We incurred external legal costs related to intellectual property litigation of $9.6 million, $22.1 million, and $14.4 million during 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	Special charges were $70.7 million, $16.3 million, and $16.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	Interest expense was $17.2 million, $9.8 million, and $4.4 million in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P46_S1	The increase in interest expense for 2014 and 2013 resulted primarily from higher average interest rates and a higher average debt balance as compared to the prior year due to the issuance in October 2013 of $600.0 million of 2.875% fixed-rate unsecured senior notes.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	Interest income was $6.4 million, $4.6 million, and $4.8 million in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	The increase in interest income for 2014 resulted primarily from higher average investment balances.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P47_S2	The decrease in interest income for 2013 resulted primarily from lower average interest rates, partially offset by higher average investment balances.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	In December 2014, we recorded a $4.0 million impairment charge related to our promissory note receivable because it was likely that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the promissory note agreement.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	The loss on investments primarily represents our net share of gains and losses in investments accounted for under the equity method, and realized gains and losses on our available-for-sale and cost method investments.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	During 2014, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $3.5 million related to one of our cost method investments.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	In March 2014, we recorded a $3.7 million insurance settlement gain related to inventory that was damaged in the fourth quarter of 2013.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	The foreign exchange losses relate to the foreign currency fluctuations in our global trade and intercompany receivable and payable balances, offset by the gains and losses on derivative instruments intended as an economic hedge of those exposures.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	In September 2014, we committed to purchase our Draper, Utah facility for $17.0 million under a purchase option provided in the lease agreement.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P52_S1	Under the terms of the lease agreement, we paid $1.0 million in December 2014 for certain lease contract termination costs.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	Our effective income tax rates for 2014, 2013, and 2012 were impacted as follows (in millions):
1099800_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions was $192.3 million and $127.7 million, respectively.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P54_S1	We estimate that these liabilities would be reduced by $34.3 million and $30.9 million, respectively, from offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes, and timing adjustments.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P54_S2	The net amounts of $158.0 million and $96.8 million, respectively, if not required, would favorably affect our effective tax rate.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest, penalties, and foreign exchange, is as follows (in millions):
1099800_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	As of December 31, 2014, we had accrued $6.8 million (net of $5.0 million tax benefit) of interest related to uncertain tax positions, and as of December 31, 2013, we had accrued $4.5 million (net of $3.3 million tax benefit) of interest related to uncertain tax positions.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P56_S2	During 2014, 2013, and 2012, we recognized interest expense, net of tax benefit, of $2.3 million, $1.4 million, and $1.0 million, respectively, in " Provision for Income Taxes " on the consolidated statements of operations.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	We strive to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	While we have accrued for matters we believe are more likely than not to require settlement, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise our right to appeal.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	The uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues, and issuance of new legislation, regulations, or case law.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P58_S2	Management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from these uncertain tax positions.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	At December 31, 2014, all material state, local, and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2008.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	During the third quarter of 2013, the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") completed its fieldwork for the 2009 and 2010 tax years.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P60_S1	The case is currently in suspense pending finalization of an Advance Pricing Agreement ("APA") and Joint Committee of Taxation approval.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	The IRS began its examination of the 2011 and 2012 tax years during the fourth quarter of 2013.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	We have also entered into an APA process between the Switzerland and the United States governments for the years 2009 through 2015 covering transfer pricing matters.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P62_S1	These transfer pricing matters are significant to our consolidated financial statements, and the final outcome of the negotiations between the two governments is uncertain.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	During 2014, we also filed with the IRS a request for a pre-filing agreement associated with a tax return filing position on a portion of the litigation settlement payment received from Medtronic in May 2014 (see Note 4 to the " Consolidated Financial Statements ").
1099800_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	Management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result for our uncertain tax positions.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P64_S1	Based upon the information currently available and numerous possible outcomes, we cannot reasonably estimate what, if any, changes in our existing uncertain tax positions may occur in the next 12 months and thus have recorded the gross uncertain tax positions as a long-term liability.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P64_S2	However, if the APA and/or pre-filing agreement is finalized in the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that these events could result in a significant change in our uncertain tax positions within the next 12 months.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 included (1) $262.1 million of tax expense associated with a $750.0 million litigation settlement payment received from Medtronic in May 2014 (see Note 4 to the " Consolidated Financial Statements ") and (2) $4.8 million of tax benefits from the remeasurement of uncertain tax positions.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	The federal research credit expired on December 31, 2011 and was reinstated on January 2, 2013.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P66_S1	As a result, the effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2012 was calculated without a benefit for the federal research credit.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P66_S2	The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 included (1) an $8.4 million benefit for the full year 2012 federal research credit and (2) $31.3 million of tax expense associated with the $83.6 million litigation award received from Medtronic in February 2013 (see Note 4 to the " Consolidated Financial Statements ").
1099800_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	We have received tax incentives in Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Singapore, and Switzerland.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P67_S1	The tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rates favorably impacted earnings per diluted share for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 by $0.63, $0.44, and $0.39, respectively.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P67_S2	The Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Singapore, and Switzerland grants provide our manufacturing operations partial or full exemption from local taxes until the years 2028, 2030 (subject to review beginning in 2015), 2024, and 2015, respectively.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	Our sources of cash liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, amounts available under credit facilities, and cash from operations.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P68_S1	We believe that these sources are sufficient to fund the current requirements of working capital, capital expenditures, and other financial commitments for the next twelve months.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	time, seek to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P69_S1	We believe that we have the financial flexibility to attract long-term capital to fund short-term and long-term growth objectives.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P69_S2	However, no assurances can be given that such long-term capital will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	We believe that cash held in the United States, in addition to amounts available under credit facilities and cash from operations, are sufficient to fund our United States operating requirements for the next twelve months.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside the United States have historically been used to fund international operations and acquire businesses outside of the United States, although a portion of those amounts may, from time to time, be subject to temporary intercompany loans into the United States.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P71_S1	As of December 31, 2014, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held in the United States and outside the United States were $651.7 million and $787.1 million, respectively.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P71_S2	The majority of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside the United States relates to undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries, which are considered by us to be indefinitely reinvested.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P71_S3	Repatriations of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside the United States are subject to restrictions in certain jurisdictions, and may be subject to withholding and other taxes.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P71_S4	The potential tax liability related to any repatriation would be dependent on the facts and circumstances that exist at the time such repatriation is made and the complexities of the tax laws of the United States and the respective foreign jurisdictions.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	We have a Five-Year Credit Agreement ("the Credit Agreement") which provides up to an aggregate of $750.0 million in borrowings in multiple currencies.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P72_S1	As of December 31, 2014, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	In October 2013, we issued $600.0 million of 2.875% fixed-rate unsecured senior notes due October 15, 2018.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	From time to time, we repurchase shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P74_S1	We consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, expected dilution from stock plans, cash capacity, and the market price of our common stock.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P74_S2	During 2014, we repurchased a total of 4.4 million shares at an aggregate cost of $300.0 million, and as of December 31, 2014, had remaining authority to purchase $952.5 million of our common stock.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	Net cash flows provided by operating activities of $1,022.3 million for 2014 increased $549.6 million from 2013 due primarily to (1) the $750.0 million upfront payment received from Medtronic under a litigation settlement agreement, (2) a lower bonus payout in 2014 associated with 2013 bonuses, and (3) improved operating performance.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P75_S1	These increases were partially offset by (1) income tax payments of $224.5 million related to the Medtronic settlement, (2) the prior year receipt of $83.6 million from Medtronic in satisfaction of the initial April 2010 jury award of damages for infringement of the United States Andersen transcatheter heart valve patent, and (3) the $50.0 million charitable contribution to the Edwards Lifesciences Foundation in 2014.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P76_S0	Net cash flows provided by operating activities of $472.7 million for 2013 increased $110.6 million from 2012 due primarily to (1) the receipt of $83.6 million from Medtronic, Inc. in satisfaction of the April 2010 jury award of damages for infringement of the U.S. Andersen transcatheter heart valve patent, (2) increased collection of accounts receivable, and (3) improved operating performance.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P76_S1	These increases were partially offset by (1) a $22.7 million increase in inventory purchases to support future product launches and (2) a $17.0 million impact from excess tax benefits from stock plans, primarily as a result of the realization of excess tax benefits that had been previously unrealized due to credit carryforwards and net operating losses in the United States in 2011 and 2012.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P77_S0	Net cash used in investing activities of $633.0 million in 2014 consisted primarily of net purchases of investments of $527.4 million and capital expenditures of $82.9 million.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P78_S0	Net cash used in investing activities of $412.7 million in 2013 consisted primarily of net purchases of investments of $300.9 million and capital expenditures of $109.0 million.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P79_S0	Net cash used in financing activities of $153.0 million in 2014 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of $300.9 million, partially offset by proceeds from stock plans of $113.3 million, and the excess tax benefit from stock plans of $49.4 million (including the realization of previously unrealized excess tax benefits).
1099800_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	Net cash provided by financing activities of $34.9 million in 2013 consisted primarily of net proceeds from debt of $409.6 million, the excess tax benefit from stock plans of $73.5 million (including the realization of previously unrealized excess tax benefits), and proceeds from stock plans of $45.5 million, partially offset by repurchases of common stock of $496.9 million.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P81_S0	A summary of all of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2014 were as follows (in millions):
1099800_15_ITEM7_P82_S0	The amount included in "Less Than 1 Year" reflects anticipated contributions to our various pension plans.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P82_S1	Anticipated contributions beyond one year are not determinable.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P82_S2	The total accrued benefit liability for our pension plans recognized as of December 31, 2014 was $49.3 million.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P82_S3	This amount is impacted by, among other items, pension expense funding levels, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and investment return on plan assets.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P82_S4	Therefore, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid, and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P82_S5	See Note 12 to the " Consolidated Financial Statements " for further information.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	(b) Capital commitment obligations consist primarily of cash that we are obligated to pay to our limited partnership and limited liability corporation investees.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P83_S1	These investees make equity investments in various development stage biopharmaceutical and medical device companies, and it is not certain if and/or when these payments will be made.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P83_S2	(c) As of December 31, 2014, the liability for uncertain tax positions including interest was $204.1 million.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	We have entered into an APA process between the Switzerland and the United States governments for the years 2009 through 2015 covering transfer pricing matters.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P84_S1	These transfer pricing matters are significant to our consolidated financial statements, and the final outcome of the negotiations between the two governments is uncertain.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P84_S2	Management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result for our uncertain tax positions.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P84_S3	We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid, and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P85_S1	In situations where we have no ability to influence the achievement of the milestone or otherwise avoid the payment, we have included those payments in the table above.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P85_S2	However, we have excluded from the table contingent milestone payments and other contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payments or for which we can avoid making payment by unilaterally deciding to stop development of a product or cease progress of a clinical trial.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P85_S3	We estimate that these contingent payments could be up to approximately $110.0 million if all milestones or other contingent obligations were met.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P86_S0	Certain of our accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ("GAAP").
1099800_15_ITEM7_P86_S1	In evaluating our transactions, management assesses all relevant GAAP and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	The application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P87_S1	These matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain, and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P87_S2	Management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements, using historical experience and all available information.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P87_S3	We also use outside experts where appropriate.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	We apply estimation methodologies consistently from year to year.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P89_S0	We believe the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P90_S0	When we recognize revenue from the sale of our products, we record an estimate of various sales returns and allowances which reduces product sales and accounts receivable.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P90_S1	These adjustments include estimates for rebates, returns, and other sales allowances.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P90_S2	These provisions are estimated based upon historical payment experience, historical relationship to revenues, estimated customer inventory levels, and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P90_S3	Product returns are not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P90_S4	If the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not approximate future activity, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be impacted.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P91_S0	In addition, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P91_S1	For these transactions, we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P91_S2	Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls, and variation in product utilization all affect the estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P92_S0	Our sales adjustment related to distributor rebates given to our United States distributors represents the difference between our sales price to the distributor (at our distributor "list price") and the negotiated price to be paid by the end-customer.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P92_S1	We validate the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from our distributors or an estimate of the distributor's inventory.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P92_S2	This distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P92_S3	We periodically monitor current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the credit for future distributor rebates is fairly stated.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P93_S0	The valuation of our inventory requires us to estimate excess, obsolete, and expired inventory.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P93_S1	We base our provisions for excess, obsolete, and expired inventory on our estimates of forecasted net sales.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P93_S2	A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional allowances for excess, obsolete, and expired inventory in the future.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P93_S3	In addition, our industry is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P93_S4	Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls, increasing levels of consigned inventory, and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess, obsolete, and expired inventory.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P94_S0	We acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations and asset purchases.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P94_S1	The acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value, which is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P94_S2	The determination of fair value requires significant estimates, including, but not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate used to discount those cash flows, the assessment of the asset's life cycle, including the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects, and the consideration of legal, technical, regulatory, economic, and competitive risks.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P95_S0	Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to IPR D acquired in business combinations, are reviewed for impairment annually, or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P95_S1	Additionally, management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and long-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P95_S2	The impairment reviews require significant estimates about fair value, including estimation of future cash flows, selection of an appropriate discount rate, and estimates of long-term growth rates.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P96_S0	The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P96_S1	Realization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P96_S2	Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P97_S0	We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P97_S1	Our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P97_S2	These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income amongst various tax jurisdictions.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P97_S3	We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P97_S4	Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions, including estimating the ultimate resolution to intercompany pricing controversies between countries when there are numerous possible outcomes.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P97_S5	We review these tax uncertainties quarterly and adjust the liability as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as the progress of tax audits, lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues, and issuance of new legislation, regulations, or case law.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P98_S0	We measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards based on estimated fair values.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P99_S0	Stock-based awards consist of stock options, restricted stock units, market-based restricted stock units, and employee stock purchase subscriptions.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P99_S1	The fair value of each option award and employee stock purchase subscription is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P99_S2	The fair value of market-based restricted stock units is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which uses multiple input variables to determine the probability of satisfying the market condition requirements.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P99_S3	The Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo models require various highly judgmental assumptions, including stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected option term.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P99_S4	Stock-based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P99_S5	Judgment is required in estimating the stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited.
1099800_15_ITEM7_P99_S6	If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets, including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We manage these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Our investment strategy is focused on preserving capital and supporting our liquidity requirements, while earning a reasonable market return.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P1_S2	We invest in a variety of fixed-rate debt securities, primarily time deposits, commercial paper, U.S. government and agency securities, municipal securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, and municipal securities.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P1_S3	Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P1_S4	The market value of our investments may decline if current market interest rates rise, which could result in a realized loss if we choose or are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity, which we currently do not anticipate.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P1_S5	As of December 31, 2014, we had $999.5 million of investments in fixed-rate debt securities which had an average remaining term to maturity of approximately 0.5 years.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P1_S6	A hypothetical 25 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2014 would have resulted in a $1.2 million decrease in the fair value of these investments.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We are also exposed to interest rate risk on our debt obligations.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P2_S1	As of December 31, 2014, we had $600.0 million of Notes outstanding that carry a fixed rate, and also had available a $750.0 million Credit Agreement that carries a variable interest rate based on the London interbank offered rate ("LIBOR").
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P2_S2	As of December 31, 2014, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P3_S0	To diversify our interest rate risk, we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300.0 million.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The critical terms of the swaps match the critical terms of $300.0 million of the debt issuance, effectively converting that portion of the fixed-rate issue to a floating variable rate based on a 6-month LIBOR benchmark.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Based on our year end 2014 and 2013 variable debt levels, a hypothetical 10% increase in our weighted-average interest rate would have an immaterial effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P4_S1	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, a hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of the fixed-rate debt by approximately $5.2 million and $6.0 million, respectively.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P4_S2	This hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixed-rate debt.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P5_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P5_S1	These risks include the translation of local currency balances and results of our non-United States subsidiaries into United States dollars, currency gains and losses related to intercompany and third-party transactions denominated in currencies other than a location's functional currency, and currency gains and losses associated with intercompany loans.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Our principal currency exposures relate to the Euro and the Japanese yen.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P5_S3	Our objective is to minimize the volatility of our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and the use of derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options contracts.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P5_S4	We do not hedge our exposure related to our net investments in our non-United States subsidiaries.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P5_S5	The total notional amounts of our derivative financial instruments entered into for foreign currency management purposes at December 31, 2014 and 2013 were $770.4 million and $805.5 million, respectively.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P5_S6	A hypothetical 10% increase/decrease in the value of the United States dollar against all hedged currencies would increase/decrease the fair value of these derivative contracts by $46.3 million and $51.1 million, respectively.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P5_S7	Any gains or losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions, so the net impact would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Derivative financial instruments involve credit risk in the event the financial institution counterparty should default.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P6_S1	It is our policy to execute such instruments with major financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P6_S2	At December 31, 2014, all derivative financial instruments were with bank counterparties assigned investment grade ratings by national rating agencies.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P6_S3	We further diversify our derivative financial instruments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P6_S4	We have not experienced a counterparty default and do not anticipate any non-performance by our current derivative counterparties.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P7_S0	We invest excess cash in a variety of fixed-rate debt securities, and diversify the investments between financial institutions.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P8_S0	In the normal course of business, we provide credit to customers in the health care industry, perform credit evaluations of these customers, and maintain allowances for potential credit losses, which have historically been adequate compared to actual losses.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P8_S1	In 2014, we had no customers that represent 10% or more of our total net sales or accounts receivable, net.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P9_S0	We continue to do business with foreign governments in certain European countries that have experienced a deterioration in credit and economic conditions.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P9_S1	These conditions have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a reduction in value and an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect accounts receivable outstanding in these countries.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P9_S2	In addition, we may also be impacted by declines in sovereign credit ratings or sovereign defaults in these countries.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P9_S3	As of December 31, 2014, our accounts receivables, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, from customers in certain European countries were $69.7 million.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P10_S0	We are exposed to investment risks related to changes in the fair values of our investments.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P10_S1	As of December 31, 2014, we had $839.4 million of investments in fixed-rate debt securities designated as held-to-maturity, of which $72.3 million were long-term, and $160.1 million of investments in fixed-rate debt securities designated as available-for-sale, of which $142.2 million were long-term.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P10_S2	As of December 31, 2014, we had recorded unrealized losses of $0.4 million on the available-for-sale investments in " Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss ," net of tax.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P11_S0	Should we choose or be forced to sell an investment that has declined in market value prior to its maturity, we may be required to realize losses in principal.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P11_S1	In addition, we invest in equity instruments of public and private companies.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P11_S2	As of December 31, 2014, we had $26.4 million of investments in equity instruments of other companies and had recorded unrealized gains of $0.4 million on these investments in " Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss ," net of tax.
1099800_15_ITEM7A_P11_S3	Should these companies experience a decline in financial condition or fail to meet certain development milestones, the decline in the investments' values may be considered other than temporary and impairment charges may be necessary.
1099800_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
1099800_15_ITEM9A_P0_S1	The Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of December 31, 2014.
1099800_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Based on their evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded as of December 31, 2014 that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective in providing reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1099800_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1099800_15_ITEM9A_P2_S1	The Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
1099800_15_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1099800_15_ITEM9A_P2_S3	Based on that evaluation, the Company's management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2014.
1099800_15_ITEM9A_P2_S4	The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.
1099800_15_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1099800_15_ITEM9A_P3_S1	There have been no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the Company's fourth fiscal quarter of 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

1099800_16_ITEM1_P56_S4	Additionally, even if a product is cleared or approved, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of these products once commercialized.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P57_S0	The FDA has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order the repair, replacement, or refund of the costs of such devices, or preclude the importation of devices that are or appear violative.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P57_S1	The FDA also conducts inspections to determine compliance with the quality system regulations concerning the manufacturing and design of devices and current medical device reporting regulations, recall regulations, clinical testing regulations, and other requirements.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P57_S2	The FDA may withdraw product clearances or approvals due to failure to comply with regulatory standards, or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval, and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P57_S3	Additionally, the failure to comply with FDA or comparable regulatory standards or the discovery of previously unknown product problems could result in fines, delays, or suspensions of regulatory clearances or approvals, seizures, injunctions, recalls, refunds, civil money penalties, or criminal prosecution.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P57_S4	Our compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P57_S5	Moreover, the FDA and several other United States agencies administer controls over the export of medical devices from the United States and the import of devices into the United States, which could also subject us to sanctions for noncompliance.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P58_S0	In May 2013, we received a warning letter from the Denver District Office of the FDA resulting from an inspection of our facility in Draper, Utah.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P58_S1	The warning letter relates specifically to the execution of our quality systems at the Utah facility, including design and process validation, corrective and preventive actions, finished device acceptance, and packaging, and indicated that we would not receive pre-market approvals for devices reasonably related to those issues until the issues are resolved.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P59_S0	Our Utah facility manufactures devices such as cannulae and cardioplegia catheters, heart valve repair rings, and transcatheter heart valve delivery system components and accessories.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P59_S1	We are actively implementing the necessary actions to resolve these issues identified in the letter.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P59_S2	In June 2014, we were granted a variance from the FDA for the SAPIEN XT delivery systems and components that are manufactured at the Draper facility and have completed the items under our agreed upon action plan for addressing the safety and effectiveness of their intended use.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P60_S0	We are also subject to additional laws and regulations that govern our business operations, products, and technologies, including:
1099800_16_ITEM1_P61_S0	the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which can be used to prosecute companies in the United States for arrangements with foreign government officials or other parties outside the United States.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P62_S0	Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal liability, significant fines or penalties, negative publicity, and substantial costs and expenses associated with investigation and enforcement activities.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P63_S0	To assist in our compliance efforts, we adhere to many codes of ethics and conduct regarding our sales and marketing activities in the United States and other countries in which we operate.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P63_S1	In addition, we have in place a dedicated team to improve our internal business compliance programs and policies.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P64_S0	Internationally, the regulation of medical devices is complex.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P64_S1	In Europe, our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P64_S2	The regulatory regime in the European Union for medical devices became mandatory in June 1998.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P64_S3	It requires that medical devices may only be placed on the market if they do not compromise safety and health when properly installed, maintained, and used in accordance with their intended purpose.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P65_S0	National laws conforming to the European Union's legislation regulate our products under the medical devices regulatory system.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P65_S1	Although the more variable national requirements under which medical devices were formerly regulated have been substantially replaced by the European Union Medical Devices Directive, individual nations can still impose unique requirements that may require supplemental submissions.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P66_S0	The European Union medical device laws require manufacturers to declare that their products conform to the essential regulatory requirements after which the products may be placed on the market bearing the CE Mark.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P66_S1	Manufacturers' quality systems for products in all but the lowest risk classification are also subject to certification and audit by an independent notified body.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P67_S0	In Europe, particular emphasis is being placed on more sophisticated and faster procedures for the reporting of adverse events to the competent authorities.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P68_S0	In Japan, pre-market approval and clinical studies are required as is governmental pricing approval for medical devices.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P68_S1	Clinical studies are subject to a stringent "Good Clinical Practices" standard.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P68_S2	Approval time frames from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare vary from simple notifications to review periods of one or more years, depending on the complexity and risk level of the device.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P68_S3	In addition, importation of medical devices into Japan is subject to the "Good Import Practices" regulations.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P68_S4	As with any highly regulated market, significant changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect future sales.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P69_S0	In many of the other foreign countries in which we market our products, we may be subject to regulations affecting, among other things:
1099800_16_ITEM1_P70_S0	Many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the FDA.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P70_S1	In some regions, the level of government regulation of medical devices is increasing, which can lengthen time to market and increase registration and approval costs.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P71_S0	In many countries, the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed and considered eligible for reimbursement.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P72_S0	Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs, including price regulation and competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness reviews, technology assessments, and managed-care arrangements, are continuing in many countries where we do business, including the United States, Europe, and Japan.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P72_S1	As a result of these changes, the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical therapies.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P72_S2	For example, government programs, private health care insurance, and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by restricting coverage and limiting the level of reimbursement for procedures or treatments, and some third-party payors require their pre-approval before new or innovative devices or therapies are utilized by patients.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P72_S3	These various initiatives have created increased price sensitivity over medical products generally and may impact demand for our products and technologies.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P73_S0	The delivery of our products is subject to regulation by the Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") in the United States and comparable state and foreign agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P73_S1	Foreign governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P74_S0	Reimbursement schedules regulate the amount the United States government will reimburse hospitals and doctors for the inpatient care of persons covered by Medicare.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P74_S1	HHS' Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services ("CMS") may also review whether and/or under what circumstances a procedure or technology is reimbursable for Medicare beneficiaries.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P75_S0	Changes in current reimbursement levels could have an adverse effect on market demand and our pricing flexibility.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P76_S0	Health care cost containment efforts have also prompted domestic hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power, and this trend is expected to continue.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P76_S1	The medical device industry has also experienced some consolidation, partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P76_S2	As a result, transactions with customers are larger, more complex, and tend to involve more long-term contracts than in the past.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P76_S3	These larger customers, due to their enhanced purchasing power, may attempt to increase the pressure on product pricing.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P77_S0	In 2010, significant reforms to the health care system were adopted as law in the United States.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P77_S1	The law includes provisions that, among other things, reduce or limit Medicare reimbursement, require all individuals to have health insurance (with limited exceptions), and impose increased taxes.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P77_S2	Specifically, the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize health care reform in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on United States sales of most medical devices.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P77_S3	The excise tax, which increased our operating expenses, was suspended for calendar years 2016 and 2017, but is scheduled to resume in 2018.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P78_S0	The long term impact of the payment reform provisions in the 2010 health care law remains uncertain to us as these programs continue to evolve.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P79_S0	medical procedure volumes, lower reimbursement for our products, and impact the demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P80_S0	Our quarterly net sales are influenced by many factors, including new product introductions, acquisitions, regulatory approvals, patient and physician holiday schedules, and other factors.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P80_S1	Net sales in the third quarter are typically lower than other quarters of the year due to the seasonality of the United States and European markets, where summer vacation schedules normally result in fewer medical procedures.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P81_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 9,800 employees worldwide, the majority of whom were located in the United States, the Dominican Republic, Singapore, and Puerto Rico.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P81_S1	Other major concentrations of employees are located in Europe and Japan.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P82_S0	We emphasize competitive compensation, benefits, equity participation, and a positive and attractive work environment in our efforts to attract and retain qualified personnel, and employ a rigorous talent management system.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P82_S1	None of our North American employees are represented by a labor union.
1099800_16_ITEM1_P82_S2	In various countries outside of North America, we interact with trade unions and work councils that represent a limited number of employees.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our business and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	An investor should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P0_S3	If any of these events or circumstances occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be materially harmed.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P0_S4	In that case, the value of our securities could decline and an investor could lose part or all of his or her investment.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P0_S5	In addition, forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws that are contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in our other filings or statements may be subject to the risks described below as well as other risks and uncertainties.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P0_S6	Please read the cautionary notice regarding forward-looking statements in Item 1, "Business," above.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our products may become obsolete and our operating results may suffer.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The cardiovascular products industry is characterized by technological changes, frequent new product introductions, and evolving industry standards.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Without the timely introduction of new and improved products, our products could become technologically obsolete or more susceptible to competition and our revenue and operating results would suffer.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Even if we are able to develop new or improved products, our ability to market them could be limited by the need for regulatory clearance, restrictions imposed on approved indications, entrenched patterns of clinical practice, uncertainty over third-party reimbursement, or other factors.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P2_S3	We devote significant financial and other resources to our research and development activities; however, the research and development process is prolonged and entails considerable uncertainty.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Accordingly, products we are currently developing may not complete the development process or obtain the regulatory or other approvals required to market such products in a timely manner or at all.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Technical innovations often require substantial time and investment before we can determine their commercial viability.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We may not have the financial resources necessary to fund all of these projects.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	In addition, even if we are able to successfully develop new or improved products, they may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development, and they may be rendered obsolete or less competitive by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products with newer technologies or features or other factors.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We may experience supply interruptions that could harm our ability to manufacture products.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We use a broad range of raw and organic materials and other items in the design and manufacture of our products.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our Surgical and Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy products are manufactured from treated natural animal tissue and man-made materials.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Our non-implantable products are manufactured from man-made raw materials including resins, chemicals, electronics, and metals.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	external suppliers, and we purchase certain supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance, cost-effectiveness, availability, or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We also contract with third parties for important services related to infrastructure and information technology.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P6_S2	General economic conditions could adversely affect the financial viability of our suppliers, resulting in their inability to provide materials and components used in the manufacture of our products.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P6_S3	While we work closely with suppliers to monitor their financial viability, assure continuity of supply, and maintain high quality and reliability, these efforts may not be successful.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P6_S4	In addition, due to the rigorous regulations and requirements of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products (including the need for approval of any change in supply arrangements), we may have difficulty establishing additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or at all if the need arises.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Certain suppliers may also elect to no longer service medical device companies due to the high amount of requirements and regulation.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P6_S6	Although alternative supplier options are considered and identified, we typically do not pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships and the time and expense associated with the regulatory validation process.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P6_S7	A change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to product performance or incorporate unique technology, and the loss of any existing supply contract could have a material adverse effect on us.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Regulatory agencies in the United States or other international geographies from time to time have limited or banned the use of certain materials used in the manufacture of our products.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	In these circumstances, transition periods typically provide time to arrange for alternative materials.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In addition, the SEC enacted disclosure rules regarding products that may contain certain minerals that originate from conflict areas in and around the Democratic Republic of Congo.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P7_S3	If our suppliers cannot verify that their components do not originate from these conflict areas, we may need to source components from alternative suppliers.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P7_S4	If we are unable to identify alternative materials or suppliers and secure approval for their use in a timely manner, our business could be harmed.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Some of our suppliers are located outside the United States.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	As a result, trade or regulatory embargoes imposed by foreign countries or the United States could result in delays or shortages that could harm our business.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	If we or one of our suppliers encounters manufacturing or quality problems, including as a result of natural disasters, our business could suffer.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls, due in part to rigorous regulatory requirements.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	In addition, quality is extremely important due to the serious and costly consequences of a product failure.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Problems can arise during the manufacturing process for a number of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow protocols and procedures, raw material problems, software problems, or human error.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Although closely managed, disruptions can occur during implementation of new equipment and systems to replace aging equipment, as well as during production line transfers and expansions.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P10_S4	As we expand into new markets, we may face unanticipated surges in demand which could strain our production capacity.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P10_S5	If these problems arise or if we otherwise fail to meet our internal quality standards or those of the FDA or other applicable regulatory body, which include detailed record-keeping requirements, our reputation could be damaged, we could become subject to a safety alert or a recall, we could incur product liability and other costs, product approvals could be delayed, and our business could otherwise be adversely affected.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	In addition, our manufacturing facilities in California, Utah, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico could be materially damaged by earthquakes, hurricanes, and other natural disasters or catastrophic circumstances.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	While we believe that our exposure to significant losses from a catastrophic disaster could be partially mitigated by our ability to manufacture some of our products at our other manufacturing facilities, the losses could have a material adverse effect on our business for an indeterminate period of time before this manufacturing transition is complete and operates without significant disruption.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We may be required, from time to time, to recognize charges in connection with the write-down of our assets or business dispositions or for other reasons.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	From time to time, we identify operations and products that are not performing at a level commensurate with the rest of our business.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We may seek to dispose of these underperforming operations or products.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We may also seek to dispose of other operations or products for strategic or other business reasons.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P13_S3	If we cannot dispose of an operation or product on acceptable terms, we may voluntarily cease operations related to that product.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Any of these events could result in charges, which could be substantial and which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We may not successfully identify and complete acquisitions or strategic alliances on favorable terms or achieve anticipated synergies relating to any acquisitions or alliances, and such acquisitions could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, require significant management resources, and require significant charges or write-downs.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We regularly explore potential acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies, services, or products, as well as potential strategic alliances.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates or appropriate partners with which to form alliances.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Even if we identify appropriate acquisition or alliance candidates, we may be unable to complete the acquisitions or alliances on favorable terms, if at all.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P15_S3	In addition, the process of integrating an acquired business, technology, service, or product into our existing operations could result in unforeseen difficulties and expenditures.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Integration of an acquired company often requires significant expenditures as well as significant management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our other businesses.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Moreover, we may not realize the anticipated financial or other benefits of an acquisition or alliance.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We may be required to take charges or write-downs in connection with acquisitions.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	In particular, acquisitions of businesses engaged in the development of new products may give rise to in-process research and development ("IPR D") assets.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P16_S2	To the extent that the value of these assets declines, we may be required to write down the value of the assets.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Also, in connection with certain asset acquisitions, we may be required to take an immediate charge related to acquired IPR D. Either of these situations could result in substantial charges, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Future acquisitions could also involve the issuance of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization of expenses related to other intangible assets, any of which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	In addition, equity or debt financing required for such acquisitions may not be available.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We face intense competition, and if we do not compete effectively, our business will be harmed.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The cardiovascular medical device industry is highly competitive.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We compete with many companies, some of which are larger and have longer operating histories, better brand or name recognition, and broader product offerings.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Our customers consider many factors when selecting a product, including product reliability, breadth of product line, clinical outcomes, product availability, price, availability and rate of reimbursement, and services provided by the manufacturer.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P19_S3	In addition, our ability to compete will depend in large part on our ability to develop and acquire new products and technologies, anticipate technology advances, and keep pace with other developers of cardiovascular therapies and technologies.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Our sales, technical, and other key personnel play an integral role in the development, marketing, and selling of new and existing products.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	If we are unable to recruit, hire, develop, and retain a talented, competitive workforce, our ability to compete may be adversely affected.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Our competitive position can also be adversely affected by product problems, physician advisories, and safety alerts, reflecting the importance of quality in the medical device industry.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Our position can shift as a result of any of these factors.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P20_S3	See " Competition " under " Business " included herein.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Unsuccessful clinical trials or procedures relating to products under development could have a material adverse effect on our prospects.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The regulatory approval process for new products and new indications for existing products requires extensive clinical trials and procedures, including early clinical experiences and regulatory studies.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from current or future clinical trials or procedures conducted by us, our competitors, or third parties, or perceptions regarding this clinical data, could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary approvals and the market's view of our future prospects.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Such clinical trials and procedures are inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that these trials or procedures will be completed in a timely or cost-effective manner or result in a commercially viable product.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Failure to successfully complete these trials or procedures in a timely and cost-effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our prospects.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Clinical trials or procedures may experience significant setbacks even after earlier trials have shown promising results.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Further, preliminary results from clinical trials or procedures may be contradicted by subsequent clinical analysis.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P23_S2	In addition, results from our clinical trials or procedures may not be supported by actual long-term studies or clinical experience.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P23_S3	If preliminary clinical results are later contradicted, or if initial results cannot be supported by actual long-term studies or clinical experience, our business could be adversely affected.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Clinical trials or procedures may be suspended or terminated by us, the FDA, or other regulatory authorities at any time if it is believed that the trial participants face unacceptable health risks.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The success of many of our products depends upon strong relationships with certain key physicians.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The development, marketing, and sale of many of our products requires us to maintain working relationships with physicians upon whom we rely to provide considerable knowledge and experience.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	These physicians may assist us as researchers, marketing consultants, product trainers and consultants, inventors, and as public speakers.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	or other developments limit our ability to maintain strong relationships with these professionals or to continue to receive their advice and input, the development and marketing of our products could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	General economic and political conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	External factors can affect our profitability and financial condition.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Such external factors include general domestic and global economic conditions, such as interest rates, tax rates, and factors affecting global economic stability, and the political environment regarding health care in general.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P28_S2	The strength and timing of the current economic recovery remains uncertain, and we cannot predict to what extent the global economic conditions may negatively impact our business.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P28_S3	For example, negative conditions in the credit and capital markets could impair our ability to access the financial markets for working capital or other funds, and could negatively impact our ability to borrow.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P28_S4	An increase in interest rates could result in an increase in our borrowing costs and could otherwise restrict our ability to access the capital markets.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Such conditions could result in decreased liquidity and impairments in the carrying value of our investments, and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P28_S6	These and other conditions could also adversely affect our customers, and may impact their ability or decision to purchase our products or make payments on a timely basis.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	In 2010, significant reforms to the health care system were adopted as law in the United States.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The law includes provisions that, among other things, reduce or limit Medicare reimbursement, require all individuals to have health insurance (with limited exceptions), and impose increased taxes.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Specifically, the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize health care reform in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on United States sales of most medical devices.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P29_S3	The excise tax, which increased our operating expenses, was suspended for calendar years 2016 and 2017, but is scheduled to resume in 2018.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The long term impact of the payment reform provisions in the 2010 health care law remains uncertain to us as these programs continue to evolve.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	This law or any future legislation, including deficit reduction legislation, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and prospects if they were to impact the demand for our products or pricing, or result in cuts to, or a restructuring of, entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our business is subject to economic, political, and other risks associated with international sales and operations, including risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Because we sell our products in a number of countries, our business is subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including risks associated with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Our net sales originating outside the United States, as a percentage of total net sales, were 49% in 2015 .
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P32_S2	We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P32_S3	In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the United States.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P32_S4	Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Substantially all of our sales outside of the United States are denominated in local currencies.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Measured in local currency, a substantial portion of our international sales was generated in Europe (and primarily denominated in the Euro) and in Japan.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P33_S2	The United States dollar value of our international sales varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Decreases in the value of the United States dollar to the Euro or the Japanese yen have the effect of increasing our reported revenues even when the volume of international sales has remained constant.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Increases in the value of the United States dollar relative to the Euro or the Japanese yen, as well as other currencies, have the opposite effect and, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cost of sales, and results of operations.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P33_S5	We have a hedging program for certain currencies that attempts to manage currency exchange rate risks to an acceptable level based on management's judgment of the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity, and cost; however, this hedging program does not completely eliminate the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act, and similar laws in other jurisdictions contain prohibitions against bribery and other illegal payments, and make it an offense to fail to have procedures in place that prevent such payments.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Recent years have seen an increasing number of investigations and other enforcement activities under these laws.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Although we have compliance programs in place with respect to these laws, which may be used as a defense to prove we had adequate procedures, no assurance can be given that a violation will not be found, and if found, the resulting penalties could adversely affect us and our business.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The stock market can be volatile and fluctuations in our quarterly sales and operating results as well as other factors could cause our financial guidance to vary from actual results and our stock price to decline.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	From time to time, the stock market experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P36_S1	This volatility can have a significant effect on the market prices of securities for reasons unrelated to underlying performance.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P36_S2	These broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect our stock price, regardless of our operating results.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P36_S3	In addition, the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in response to any of the other risk factors set out above and below, as well as a number of other factors, including the performance of comparable companies or the medical device industry, or changes in financial estimates and recommendations of securities analysts.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P37_S1	A high proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to significant selling, research and development, and manufacturing costs.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Thus, small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter, and the price of our common stock could fall.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P37_S3	Other factors that could affect our quarterly sales and operating results include:
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	our ability to expand our operations and the amount and timing of expansion-related expenditures.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The quarterly and full-year financial guidance we provide to investors and analysts with insight to our view of our future performance is based on assumptions about our sales and operating results.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Due to the nature of our business and the numerous factors that can impact our sales and operating performance, including those described above, our financial guidance may vary from actual results.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P39_S2	If we fail to meet any financial guidance that we provide, or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance during the year, the price of our common stock could decline.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The health care industry has been consolidating, and organizations such as GPOs, independent delivery networks, and large single accounts, such as the United States Veterans Administration, continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for many of our health care provider customers.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P41_S1	As a result, transactions with customers are larger and more complex, and tend to involve more long-term contracts.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P41_S2	The purchasing power of these larger customers has increased, and may continue to increase, causing downward pressure on product pricing.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P41_S3	If we are not one of the providers selected by one of these organizations, we may be precluded from making sales to its members or participants.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Even if we are one of the selected providers, we may be at a disadvantage relative to other selected providers that are able to offer volume discounts based on purchases of a broader range of medical equipment and supplies.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P41_S5	Further, we may be required to commit to pricing that has a material adverse effect on our revenues, profit margins, business, financial condition, and results of operations.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P41_S6	We expect that market demand, governmental regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide health care industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances, which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	If third-party payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or impose other cost containment measures to reduce reimbursement levels, our ability to profitably sell our products will be harmed.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We sell our products and technologies to hospitals and other health care providers, all of which receive reimbursement for the health care services provided to patients from third-party payors, such as government programs (both domestic and international), private insurance plans, and managed care programs.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P43_S1	The ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products from private and governmental third-party payors is critical to the success of medical technology companies.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P43_S2	The availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Reimbursement varies from country to country and can significantly impact acceptance of new products.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P44_S1	There can be no assurance that levels of reimbursement, if any, will not be decreased in the future, or that future legislation, regulation, or reimbursement policies of third-party payors will not otherwise adversely affect the demand for and price levels of our products.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The introduction of cost containment incentives, combined with closer scrutiny of health care expenditures by both private health insurers and employers, has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Hospitals or physicians may respond to such cost-containment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other therapies.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P45_S2	In addition, the 2010 United States health care law could adversely affect reimbursement levels for our products, or otherwise adversely affect our product pricing and profitability.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs, including price regulation, are underway in several countries around the world.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P46_S1	In many countries, customers are reimbursed for our products under a government operated insurance system.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Under such a system, the government periodically reviews reimbursement levels and may limit patient access.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P46_S3	If a government were to decide to reduce reimbursement levels, our product pricing could be adversely affected.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods as determined by such third-party payors, or was used for an unapproved indication.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Third-party payors may also deny reimbursement for experimental procedures and devices.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We believe that many of our existing products are cost-effective, even though the one-time cost may be significant, because they are intended to reduce overall health care costs over a long period of time.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P48_S1	We cannot be certain that these third-party payors will recognize these cost savings instead of merely focusing on the lower initial costs associated with competing therapies.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P48_S2	If our products are not considered cost-effective by third-party payors, our customers may not be reimbursed for them, resulting in lower sales of our products.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We may incur product liability losses that could adversely affect our operating results.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, and marketing of medical devices.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Our products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P50_S2	In addition, many of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects, or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, patients.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Such a problem could result in product liability lawsuits and claims, safety alerts, or product recalls in the future, which, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and ability to attract and retain customers.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Product liability claims may be brought from time to time either by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P52_S1	We may incur charges related to such matters in excess of any established reserves and such charges, including the establishment of any such reserves, could have a material adverse impact on our net income and net cash flows.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Our inability to protect our intellectual property or failure to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of data or other sensitive company information, by cyber-attack or other event, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Our success and competitive position are dependent in part upon our proprietary intellectual property.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P54_S1	We rely on a combination of patents and trade secrets to protect our proprietary intellectual property, and we expect to continue to do so.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Although we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of means, we cannot guarantee that the protective steps we have taken are adequate to protect these rights.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged and held invalid.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P55_S1	In addition, as our patents expire, we may be unsuccessful in extending their protection through patent term extensions.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P55_S2	The expiration of, or the failure to maintain or extend our patents, could have a material adverse effect on us.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We also rely on confidentiality agreements with certain employees, consultants, and other third parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary information.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P56_S1	These agreements could be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for such a breach.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P56_S2	In addition, others could independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary information.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Our intellectual property, other proprietary technology, and other sensitive company information is dependent on sophisticated information technology systems and is potentially vulnerable to cyber-attacks, loss, damage, destruction from system malfunction, computer viruses, loss of data privacy, or misappropriation or misuse of it by those with permitted access, and other events.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P57_S1	While we have invested to protect our intellectual property and other information, and continue to work diligently to upgrade and enhance our systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns, breaches, cyber-attacks, or other events.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P57_S2	Such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, or results of operations.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We spend significant resources to enforce our intellectual property rights, sometimes resulting in litigation.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Intellectual property litigation is complex and can be expensive and time-consuming.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P58_S2	However, our efforts in this regard may not be successful.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P58_S3	We may not be able to detect infringement.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P58_S4	In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Patent litigation can result in substantial cost and diversion of effort.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Intellectual property protection may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, enabling our competitors to capture increased market position.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P59_S2	The invalidation of key intellectual property rights or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits filed to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or prospects.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P61_S0	During recent years, we and our competitors have been involved in substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P61_S1	From time to time, we have been and may in the future be forced to defend against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, and such intellectual property litigation is typically costly and time-consuming.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Adverse determinations in any such litigation could result in significant liabilities to third parties or injunctions, or could require us to seek licenses from third parties and, if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms, prevent us from manufacturing, selling, or using certain products, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on us.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P61_S3	In addition, some licenses may be non-exclusive, which could provide our competitors access to the same technologies.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Third parties could also obtain patents that may require us to either redesign products or, if possible, negotiate licenses from such third parties.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Such licenses may materially increase our expenses.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P62_S2	If we are unable to redesign products or obtain a license, we might have to exit a particular product offering.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P63_S0	We and our customers are subject to rigorous governmental regulations and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products that are compatible with these regulations.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P63_S1	In addition, failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial sanctions which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P64_S0	The medical technologies we manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities, including regulations that cover the composition, labeling, testing, clinical study, design, sourcing, manufacturing, packaging, marketing, advertising, promotion, and distribution of our products.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We are required to register with the FDA as a device manufacturer.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P65_S1	As a result, we are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA's Quality System Regulation ("QSR") requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, design, quality control, and documentation procedures.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P65_S2	The FDA may also inspect our compliance with requirements related to adverse event reporting, recalls or corrections (field actions), the conduct of clinical studies, and other requirements.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P66_S0	In the European Union, we are required to maintain certain CE Mark and ISO certifications in order to sell our products, and are subject to periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P66_S1	If we or our suppliers fail to adhere to QSR, CE Mark, ISO, or similar requirements, this could delay or interrupt product production or sales and/or lead to fines, difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances, recalls, or other consequences, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or prospects.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Medical devices must receive FDA clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the United States.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P67_S1	In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of approved products that have been commercialized, and can prevent or limit further marketing of a product based upon the results of post-marketing programs.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P67_S2	In addition, the federal Medical Device Reporting regulations require us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P67_S3	Federal regulations also require us to report certain recalls or corrective actions to the FDA.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P67_S4	Furthermore, most major markets for medical devices outside the United States require clearance, approval, or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P67_S5	The process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device, particularly from the FDA and certain foreign governmental authorities, can be costly and time-consuming, and clearances or approvals may not be granted for products or product improvements on a timely basis, if at all.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P67_S6	Delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, clearances or approvals for products or product improvements could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations or prospects.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P68_S0	At any time after approval of a product for commercial sale, the FDA may conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with QSR requirements, and/or current Medical Device Reporting regulations, or other regulatory requirements.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Noncompliance with applicable requirements may subject us or responsible individuals to sanctions including civil money penalties, product seizure, injunction, or criminal prosecution.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P68_S2	In addition, the FDA may withhold or delay pre-market approval of our products until the noncompliance is resolved.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P68_S3	Product approvals by the FDA can also be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P69_S0	lifecycle, and require disclosure of the origin of certain raw materials in our products.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Noncompliance with applicable requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P70_S0	The United States Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and similar laws in other jurisdictions, also impose reporting and disclosure requirements on device, pharmaceutical, and biologics companies for certain financial relationships with United States health care providers and teaching hospitals.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P70_S1	Failure to submit required information or submitting incorrect information may result in significant civil monetary penalties.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P71_S0	We are also subject to various United States and international laws pertaining to health care pricing, anti-corruption, and fraud and abuse, including prohibitions on kickbacks and the submission of false claims laws and restrictions on relationships with physicians and other referral sources.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P71_S1	These laws are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation, which could require us to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if we are found not to be in compliance.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P71_S2	Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions against us and our officers and employees, including substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in governmental health care programs.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Despite our implementation of robust compliance processes, we may be subject, from time to time, to inspections, investigations, and other enforcement actions by governmental authorities.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P72_S1	If we are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, the applicable governmental authority can impose fines, delay, suspend, or revoke regulatory clearances or approvals, institute proceedings to detain or seize our products, issue a recall, impose marketing or operating restrictions, enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against us or our officers or employees, and institute criminal prosecution.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P72_S2	Moreover, governmental authorities can ban or request the recall, repair, replacement, or refund of the cost of any device or product we manufacture or distribute.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P72_S3	Any of the foregoing actions could result in decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P72_S4	In addition to the sanctions for noncompliance described above, commencement of an enforcement proceeding, inspection, or investigation could divert substantial management attention from the operation of our business and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Our industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities, which may lead to greater governmental regulation in the future.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P74_S0	In recent years, the medical device industry has been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny, including by the FDA, numerous other federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities, as well as members of Congress.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P74_S1	This has included increased regulation, enforcement, inspections, and governmental investigations of the medical device industry and disclosure of financial relationships with health care professionals.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P74_S2	We anticipate that the government will continue to scrutinize our industry closely, and that additional regulation by governmental authorities, both foreign and domestic, may increase compliance costs, exposure to litigation, and other adverse effects to our operations.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P75_S0	We are subject to risks arising from concerns and/or regulatory actions relating to mad cow disease.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Certain of our products, including pericardial tissue valves, are manufactured using bovine tissue.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Concerns relating to the potential transmission of BSE, commonly known as "mad cow disease," from cows to humans may result in reduced acceptance of products containing bovine materials.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P77_S1	Certain medical device regulatory agencies have considered whether to continue to permit the sale of medical devices that incorporate bovine material.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P78_S0	We obtain bovine tissue only from closely controlled sources within the United States and Australia.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P78_S1	The bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valves is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility for the suspected BSE infectious agent.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P78_S2	We have not experienced any significant adverse impact on our sales as a result of concerns regarding BSE, but no assurance can be given that such an impact may not occur in the future.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Use of our products in unapproved circumstances could expose us to liabilities.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P80_S0	The marketing approval from the FDA and other regulators of certain of our products are, or are expected to be, limited to specific indications.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P80_S1	We are prohibited from marketing or promoting any unapproved use of our products.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P80_S2	Physicians, however, can use these products in ways or circumstances other than those strictly within the scope of the regulatory approval.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P80_S3	Although the product training we provide to physicians and other health care professionals is limited to approved uses or for clinical trials, no assurance can be given that claims might not be asserted against us if our products are used in ways or for procedures that are not approved.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Our operations are subject to environmental, health, and safety regulations that could result in substantial costs.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Our operations are subject to environmental, health, and safety laws, and regulations concerning, among other things, the generation, handling, transportation, and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes, the cleanup of hazardous substance releases, and emissions or discharges into the air or water.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P82_S1	We have incurred and may incur expenditures in the future in connection with environmental, health and safety laws, and regulations.
1099800_16_ITEM1A_P82_S2	New laws and regulations, violations of these laws or regulations, stricter enforcement of existing requirements, or the discovery of previously unknown contamination could require us to incur costs or could become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could be material.
1099800_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Dominican Republic property has one lease that expires in 2018 and one that expires in 2022; the Puerto Rico property has one lease that expires in 2016 and one that expires in 2018; the Horw, Switzerland lease expires in 2017; the Prague, Czech Republic lease expires in 2018; the Tokyo, Japan lease expires in 2018; the Shanghai, China lease expires in 2018; and Singapore has one land lease that expires in 2036 and one that expires in 2041.
1099800_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	We believe our properties have been well maintained, are in good operating condition, and are adequate for current needs.
1099800_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	For a description of our material pending legal proceedings, please see Note 17 to the " Consolidated Financial Statements " of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated by reference.
1099800_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	The principal market for our common stock is the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE").
1099800_16_ITEM5_P0_S1	The table below sets forth, for the calendar quarters indicated, the high and low closing prices, as adjusted for the two-for-one stock split paid on December 11, 2015 to shareholders of record on November 30, 2015, of our common stock, as reported by the NYSE.
1099800_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	On January 31, 2016 , there were 12,098 stockholders of record of our common stock.
1099800_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	We have never paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends.
1099800_16_ITEM5_P2_S1	Our current policy is to retain any future earnings for use in our business.
1099800_16_ITEM5_P3_S0	The difference between the total number of shares (or units) purchased and the total number of shares (or units) purchased as part of publicly announced plans or programs is due to shares withheld by us to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units issued to employees.
1099800_16_ITEM5_P4_S0	(b) The two-for-one stock split paid on December 11, 2015 excluded treasury shares.
1099800_16_ITEM5_P4_S1	However, because some purchases of treasury shares were at post-split prices, for consistency, we calculated the average price paid per share for all shares repurchased during the quarter based on post-split market prices.
1099800_16_ITEM5_P5_S0	(c) On May 14, 2013, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to purchase on the open market, including pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, and in privately negotiated transactions, up to $750.0 million of our common stock from time to time until December 31, 2016.
1099800_16_ITEM5_P6_S0	Pursuant to our authorized share repurchase programs, we may repurchase from time to time shares of our common stock in the open market, pursuant to privately negotiated transactions, and enter into accelerated share repurchase transactions to effect repurchases of our common stock.
1099800_16_ITEM5_P7_S0	The following graph compares the performance of our common stock with that of the S P 500 Index and the S P 500 Healthcare Equipment Index.
1099800_16_ITEM5_P7_S1	The cumulative total return listed below assumes an initial investment of $100 on December 31, 2010 and reinvestment of dividends.

1099800_16_ITEM7_P0_S2	You should read this discussion in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	We are the global leader in the science of heart valves and hemodynamic monitoring.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	Driven by a passion to help patients, we partner with clinicians to develop innovative technologies in the areas of structural heart disease and critical care monitoring, enabling them to save and enhance lives.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P1_S2	We conduct operations worldwide and are managed in the following geographical regions: United States, Europe, Japan, and Rest of World.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P1_S3	Our products are categorized into the following main areas:
1099800_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy ("THV"), Surgical Heart Valve Therapy, and Critical Care.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	On November 19, 2015, our Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split of our outstanding shares of common stock effected in the form of a stock dividend, paid on December 11, 2015 to shareholders of record on November 30, 2015.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	We distributed newly issued shares to effect the stock split.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P3_S2	All applicable share and per-share amounts in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations have been retroactively adjusted to give effect to this stock split.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	The following is a summary of our financial performance (dollars in millions, except per share data):
1099800_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	Our sales growth was led by our THV products, which benefited from the launch of the Edwards SAPIEN XT transcatheter heart valve in the United States (June 2014), and the launches of the Edwards SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve in Europe (January 2014) and in the United States (July 2015).
1099800_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	Our gross profit as a percentage of net sales was positively impacted in 2015 by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (which had a negative impact to gross profit in 2014) and an improved product mix, led by THV products.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P5_S2	Net income in 2014 benefited from the receipt of $750.0 million ($487.9 million, net of tax) from Medtronic, Inc. ("Medtronic") for an upfront payment due under a litigation settlement agreement.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	The medical technology industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	Our success is measured both by the development of innovative therapies and the value they bring to our stakeholders.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P6_S2	We are committed to developing new technologies and providing innovative patient care, and we are committed to defending our intellectual property in support of those developments.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P6_S3	To strengthen our leadership and enable future growth opportunities, in 2015 we invested 15.4% of our net sales in research and development.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P6_S4	In a consolidating industry, we believe our focus on innovation and a robust product pipeline of meaningful new technologies will help us continue to be a preferred partner, sustain our successes, and build long-term value for our shareholders.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P6_S5	The following is a summary of important developments during 2015 :
1099800_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	we received FDA approval for aortic valve-in-valve procedures using the Edwards SAPIEN XT transcatheter heart valve.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	We are dedicated to generating robust clinical and economic evidence increasingly expected by patients, clinicians, and payors in the current healthcare environment, with the goal of encouraging the adoption of innovative new medical therapies that demonstrate superior outcomes.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	International net sales include the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net sales is not necessarily indicative of the impact on net income due to the corresponding effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on international manufacturing and operating costs and our hedging activities.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	The increase in net sales of THV products in the United States was due primarily to:
1099800_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	lower sales of the Edwards SAPIEN valve as customers converted to Edwards SAPIEN XT.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	The increase in international net sales of THV products was due primarily to:
1099800_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $71.2 million , due primarily to the weakening of the Euro against the United States dollar.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	The increase in net sales of THV products in the United States was due primarily to:
1099800_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	royalties received under a license agreement with Medtronic (see Note 3 to the " Consolidated Financial Statements ").
1099800_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	Sales of the Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve decreased as customers converted to Edwards SAPIEN XT .
1099800_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	The increase in international net sales of THV products was due primarily to:
1099800_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	lower sales of the Edwards SAPIEN XT valve in Europe, as customers converted to Edwards SAPIEN 3 .
1099800_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	In June 2015, we received approval from the FDA for the Edwards SAPIEN 3 valve with the Commander Delivery System for the treatment of high-risk patients.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	In January 2016, we received FDA approval for an expanded indication study of the Edwards SAPIEN 3 valve.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P18_S2	The investigational device exemption study will enroll elderly patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis who have been determined by a heart team to be at low risk for mortality if they were to undergo surgical aortic valve replacement.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P18_S3	The trial will also include a 400-patient sub-study using advanced imaging to evaluate leaflet motion in tissue heart valves.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	The decrease in net sales of Surgical Heart Valve Therapy products was due primarily to:
1099800_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	higher sales of (1) surgical heart valve products, driven by pericardial aortic tissue valves, primarily in Europe, Japan, and the United States, and (2) EDWARDS INTUITY Elite valves, primarily in Europe.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	The increase in net sales of Surgical Heart Valve Therapy products was due primarily to:
1099800_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $10.5 million, due to the weakening of various currencies against the United States dollar, mainly the Japanese yen, partially offset by the strengthening of the Euro against the United States dollar.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	The decrease in net sales of Critical Care products was due primarily to:
1099800_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	higher sales of enhanced surgical recovery products in the United States, Europe, and Rest of World.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	The increase in net sales of Critical Care products was due primarily to enhanced surgical recovery products in the United States and Rest of World, and core hemodynamic products outside the United States, partially offset by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $12.0 million due primarily to the weakening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2015 was driven by:
1099800_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	multiple investments in our operations, including an increase in costs to improve our manufacturing processes.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2014 was driven by:
1099800_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	a 0.8 percentage point increase due to an improved product mix in the United States, driven by THV products.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	The decrease in SG A expenses in 2015 resulted primarily from foreign currency, which reduced expenses by $61.1 million due primarily to the weakening of the Euro and the Japanese yen against the United States dollar.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P30_S1	This decrease was partially offset by (1) higher sales and marketing expenses in Europe, the United States, and Japan, mainly to support our THV program and (2) higher personnel-related costs.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P30_S2	The decrease in SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2015 was due primarily to higher THV sales in the United States, Europe, and Japan.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	The increase in SG A expenses in 2014 was due primarily to (1) higher sales and marketing expenses in the United States, Europe, and Japan, mainly to support our THV program and (2) higher performance-based incentive compensation.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	The increase in R D expenses in 2015 was due primarily to new THV and Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product development efforts.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	These costs were partially offset by lower spending for THV clinical trials.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	The increase in R D expenses in 2014 was due primarily to new THV product development efforts, additional investments in clinical studies in our Surgical Heart Valve Therapy program, and higher performance-based incentive compensation.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	The decrease in R D expenses as a percentage of net sales was due primarily to higher net sales.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	In May 2014, we entered into an agreement with Medtronic to settle all outstanding patent litigation between the companies, and, pursuant to the agreement, we received an upfront payment from Medtronic in the amount of $750.0 million.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	In February 2013, we received $83.6 million from Medtronic in satisfaction of the initial April 2010 jury award for damages for infringement of the United States Andersen transcatheter heart valve patent, including accrued interest.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	We incurred external legal costs related to intellectual property litigation of $7.0 million , $9.6 million, and $22.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	Intellectual property litigation expenses decreased in 2015 and 2014 due to the May 2014 litigation settlement agreement with Medtronic.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	Interest expense was $17.2 million , $17.2 million , and $9.8 million in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P37_S1	Interest expense for 2015 remained flat compared to 2014 as the impact of higher average interest rates was offset by a lower average debt balance compared to 2014.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P37_S2	The increase in interest expense for 2014 as compared to 2013 resulted primarily from higher average interest rates and a higher average debt balance due to the issuance in October 2013 of $600 million of 2.875% fixed-rate unsecured senior notes.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	Interest income was $7.9 million , $6.4 million , and $4.6 million in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P38_S1	The increase in interest income for 2015 resulted primarily from higher average investment balances and higher average interest rates.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P38_S2	The increase in interest income for 2014 resulted primarily from higher average investment balances.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	The foreign exchange losses relate to the foreign currency fluctuations primarily in our global trade and intercompany receivable and payable balances, partially offset by the gains and losses on derivative instruments intended as an economic hedge of those exposures.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	The (gain) loss on investments represents our net share of gains and losses in investments accounted for under the equity method, and realized gains and losses on our available-for-sale and cost method investments.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	During 2014, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $3.5 million related to one of our cost method investments.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	In December 2014, we recorded a $4.0 million impairment charge related to our promissory note receivable because it was likely that we would be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the promissory note agreement.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	In March 2014, we recorded a $3.7 million insurance settlement gain related to inventory that was damaged in the fourth quarter of 2013.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	In September 2014, we committed to purchase our Draper, Utah facility under a purchase option provided in the lease agreement.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	Under the terms of the lease agreement, we accrued $1.0 million for certain lease contract termination costs.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	Our effective income tax rates for 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 were impacted as follows (in millions):
1099800_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the gross unrecognized tax benefits were $216.1 million and $192.3 million , respectively.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P45_S1	We estimate that these liabilities would be reduced by $40.6 million and $34.3 million , respectively, from offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes, and timing adjustments.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P45_S2	The net amounts of $175.5 million and $158.0 million , respectively, if not required, would favorably affect our effective tax rate.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest, penalties, and foreign exchange, is as follows (in millions):
1099800_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P47_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , we had accrued $10.7 million (net of $7.6 million tax benefit) of interest related to unrecognized tax benefits, and as of December 31, 2014 , we had accrued $6.8 million (net of $5.0 million tax benefit) of interest related to unrecognized tax benefits.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P47_S2	During 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , we recognized interest expense, net of tax benefit, of $3.9 million , $2.3 million , and $1.4 million , respectively, in Provision for Income Taxes on the consolidated statements of operations.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	We strive to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	While we have accrued for matters we believe are more likely than not to require settlement, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P48_S2	Furthermore, we may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise our right to appeal.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	The uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues, and issuance of new legislation, regulations, or case law.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P49_S1	Management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from our uncertain tax positions.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	At December 31, 2015 , all material state, local, and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2008.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has substantially completed its fieldwork for the 2009 through 2012 tax years.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P51_S1	However, the audits are currently in suspense pending finalization of an Advance Pricing Agreement ("APA") and Joint Committee of Taxation approval.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	As noted above, we entered into an APA process between the Switzerland and United States governments for the years 2009 through 2015 covering transfer pricing matters.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P52_S1	The transfer pricing matters are significant to our consolidated financial statements, and the final outcome and timing of the negotiations between the two governments is uncertain.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	During 2014, we filed with the IRS a request for a pre-filing agreement associated with a tax return filing position on a portion of the litigation settlement payment received from Medtronic in May 2014.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P53_S1	During the first quarter of 2015, the IRS accepted the pre-filing agreement into the pre-filing agreement program.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P53_S2	The finalization of the pre-filing agreement is still pending.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P53_S3	However, we made an advance payment of tax in December 2015 to prevent the further accrual of interest on any potential deficiency only and not to signify any potential agreement to a contrary position that may be taken by the IRS.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	Management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from our uncertain tax positions.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P54_S1	Based upon the information currently available and numerous possible outcomes, we cannot reasonably estimate what, if any, changes in our existing uncertain tax positions may occur in the next 12 months and thus have recorded the gross uncertain tax positions as a long-term liability.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P54_S2	However, if the APA and/or pre-filing agreement is finalized in the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that these events could result in a significant change in our uncertain tax positions within the next 12 months.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 was lower than the rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily because the rate for December 31, 2014 included (1) $262.1 million of tax expense associated with a $750.0 million litigation settlement payment received from Medtronic in May 2014 (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements ) and (2) $4.8 million of tax benefits from the remeasurement of uncertain tax positions.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 included (1) an $8.4 million benefit for the full year 2012 federal research credit and (2) $31.3 million of tax expense associated with the $83.6 million litigation award received from Medtronic in February 2013 (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements ).
1099800_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	We have received tax incentives in Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Singapore, and Switzerland.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P57_S1	The tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rates favorably impacted earnings per diluted share for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 by $0.25 , $0.31 , and $0.22 , respectively.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P57_S2	The Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, and Singapore grants provide our manufacturing operations partial or full exemption from local taxes until the years 2028, 2030 (subject to review in 2015 and subsequent years), and 2024 respectively.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P57_S3	The Switzerland grant expired December 31, 2015 and we are in the process of filing for renewal through 2018.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	Our sources of cash liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, amounts available under credit facilities, and cash from operations.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P58_S1	We believe that these sources are sufficient to fund the current requirements of working capital, capital expenditures, and other financial commitments for the next twelve months.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P58_S2	However, we periodically consider various financing alternatives and may, from time to time, seek to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held in the United States and outside the United States were $266.0 million and $958.7 million, respectively.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	We believe that cash held in the United States, in addition to amounts available under credit facilities and cash from operations, are sufficient to fund our United States operating requirements for the foreseeable future.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside the United States have historically been used to fund international operations and acquire businesses and assets outside of the United States, the majority of which relates to undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries, which are considered by us to be indefinitely reinvested.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	We consider making short-term loans of cash held outside the United States to the United States from time to time based on facts and circumstances.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P61_S1	The permanent repatriations of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside the United States are subject to restrictions in certain jurisdictions, and may be subject to withholding and other taxes.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P61_S2	The potential tax liability related to any repatriation would be dependent on the facts and circumstances that exist at the time such repatriation is made and the complexities of the tax laws of the United States and the respective foreign jurisdictions.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	On July 3, 2015, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger to acquire CardiAQ for an aggregate cash purchase price of $350.0 million, subject to certain adjustments, plus an additional $50.0 million if a certain European regulatory approval is obtained within 48 months of the acquisition closing date.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P62_S1	We closed the purchase in August 2015 with available cash on hand in the United States.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	We have a Five-Year Credit Agreement ("Credit Agreement") which provides up to an aggregate of $750.0 million in borrowings in multiple currencies.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P63_S1	We may increase the amount available under the Credit Agreement, subject to agreement of the lenders, by up to an additional $250.0 million in the aggregate.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P63_S2	As of December 31, 2015 , there were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	In October 2013, we issued $600.0 million of 2.875% fixed-rate unsecured senior notes due October 15, 2018.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P64_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , the total carrying value of our long-term debt was $599.9 million .
1099800_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	From time to time, we repurchase shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P65_S1	We consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, expected dilution from stock plans, cash capacity, and the market price of our common stock.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P65_S2	During 2015 , we repurchased under the Board authorized repurchase program a total of 2.5 million shares at an aggregate cost of $275.0 million , and as of December 31, 2015 , had remaining authority to purchase $677.5 million of our common stock.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P65_S3	In February 2016, Edwards entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements to repurchase $325.0 million of the Company's common stock.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	Net cash flows provided by operating activities of $549.7 million for 2015 decreased $472.6 million from 2014 due primarily to (1) the $750.0 million upfront payment received in 2014 from Medtronic under a litigation settlement agreement and (2) a higher bonus payout in 2015 associated with 2014 performance.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P66_S1	These decreases were partially offset by (1) income tax payments of $224.5 million made in 2014 related to the Medtronic settlement, (2) improved operating performance in 2015, and (3) the $50.0 million charitable contribution made in 2014 to the Edwards Lifesciences Foundation.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	Net cash flows provided by operating activities of $1,022.3 million for 2014 increased $549.6 million from 2013 due primarily to (1) the $750.0 million upfront payment received from Medtronic under a litigation settlement agreement, (2) a lower bonus payout in 2014 associated with 2013 performance, and (3) improved operating performance.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P67_S1	These increases were partially offset by (1) income tax payments of $224.5 million related to the Medtronic settlement, (2) the prior year receipt of $83.6 million from Medtronic in satisfaction of the initial April 2010 jury award of damages for infringement of the United States Andersen transcatheter heart valve patent, and (3) the $50.0 million charitable contribution made in 2014 to the Edwards Lifesciences Foundation.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	Net cash used in investing activities of $316.1 million in 2015 consisted primarily of a $320.1 million net payment associated with the acquisition of CardiAQ and capital expenditures of $102.7 million , partially offset by net proceeds from investments of $119.6 million .
1099800_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	Net cash used in investing activities of $633.0 million in 2014 consisted primarily of net purchases of investments of $527.4 million and capital expenditures of $82.9 million .
1099800_16_ITEM7_P70_S0	Net cash used in financing activities of $158.6 million in 2015 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of $280.1 million , partially offset by proceeds from stock plans of $87.2 million , and the excess tax benefit from stock plans of $41.3 million .
1099800_16_ITEM7_P71_S0	Net cash used in financing activities of $153.0 million in 2014 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of $300.9 million , partially offset by proceeds from stock plans of $113.3 million , and the excess tax benefit from stock plans of $49.4 million (including the realization of previously unrealized excess tax benefits).
1099800_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	A summary of all of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2015 were as follows (in millions):
1099800_16_ITEM7_P73_S0	The amount included in "Less Than 1 Year" reflects anticipated contributions to our various pension plans.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P73_S1	Anticipated contributions beyond one year are not determinable.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P73_S2	The total accrued benefit liability for our pension plans recognized as of December 31, 2015 was $43.0 million .
1099800_16_ITEM7_P73_S3	This amount is impacted by, among other items, pension expense funding levels, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and investment return on plan assets.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P73_S4	Therefore, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid, and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P73_S5	See Note 12 to the " Consolidated Financial Statements " for further information.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P74_S0	(b) Capital commitment obligations consist primarily of cash that we are obligated to pay to our limited partnership and limited liability corporation investees.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P74_S1	These investees make equity investments in various development stage biopharmaceutical and medical device companies, and it is not certain if and/or when these payments will be made.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P75_S0	(c) As of December 31, 2015 , the liability for uncertain tax positions including interest was $234.4 million .
1099800_16_ITEM7_P76_S0	We have entered into an APA process between the Switzerland and the United States governments for the years 2009 through 2015 covering transfer pricing matters.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P76_S1	These transfer pricing matters are significant to our consolidated financial statements, and the final outcome of the negotiations between the two governments is uncertain.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P76_S2	Management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result for our uncertain tax positions.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P76_S3	We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid, and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P77_S0	(d) We acquire assets still in development, enter into research and development arrangements, and sponsor certain clinical trials that often require milestone, royalty, or other future payments to third-parties, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P77_S1	In situations where we have no ability to influence the achievement of the milestone or otherwise avoid the payment, we have included those payments in the table above.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P77_S2	However, we have excluded from the table contingent milestone payments and other contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payments or for which we can avoid making payment by unilaterally deciding to stop development of a product or cease progress of a clinical trial.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P77_S3	We estimate that these contingent payments could be up to approximately $170.0 million if all milestones or other contingent obligations were met.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P78_S0	Certain of our accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ("GAAP").
1099800_16_ITEM7_P78_S1	In evaluating our transactions, management assesses all relevant GAAP and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P79_S0	The application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P79_S1	These matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain, and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P79_S2	Management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements, using historical experience and all available information.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P79_S3	We also use outside experts where appropriate.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P80_S0	We apply estimation methodologies consistently from year to year.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P81_S0	We believe the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P82_S0	When we recognize revenue from the sale of our products, we record an estimate of various sales returns and allowances which reduces product sales and accounts receivable.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P82_S1	These adjustments include estimates for rebates, returns, and other sales allowances.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P82_S2	These provisions are estimated based upon historical payment experience, historical relationship to revenues, estimated customer inventory levels, and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P82_S3	Product returns are not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P82_S4	If the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not approximate future activity, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be impacted.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P83_S0	In addition, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P83_S1	For these transactions, we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P83_S2	Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls, and variation in product utilization all affect the estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P84_S0	Our sales adjustment related to distributor rebates given to our United States distributors represents the difference between our sales price to the distributor (at our distributor "list price") and the negotiated price to be paid by the end-customer.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P84_S1	We validate the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from our distributors or an estimate of the distributor's inventory.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P84_S2	This distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P84_S3	We periodically monitor current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the credit for future distributor rebates is fairly stated.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P85_S0	The valuation of our inventory requires us to estimate excess, obsolete, and expired inventory.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P85_S1	We base our provisions for excess, obsolete, and expired inventory on our estimates of forecasted net sales.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P85_S2	A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional allowances for excess, obsolete, and expired inventory in the future.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P85_S3	In addition, our industry is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P85_S4	Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls, increasing levels of consigned inventory, and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess, obsolete, and expired inventory.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P86_S0	We acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations and asset purchases.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P86_S1	The acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value, which is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P86_S2	The determination of fair value requires significant estimates, including, but not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate used to discount those cash flows, the assessment of the asset's life cycle, including the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects, and the consideration of legal, technical, regulatory, economic, and competitive risks.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	IPR D acquired in business combinations is reviewed for impairment annually, or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P87_S1	Additionally, management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and long-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P87_S2	The impairment reviews require significant estimates about fair value, including estimation of future cash flows, selection of an appropriate discount rate, and estimates of long-term growth rates.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	We record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P88_S1	We determine the fair value of the contingent consideration based primarily on the following factors:
1099800_16_ITEM7_P89_S0	On a quarterly basis, we revalue these obligations and record changes in their fair value as an adjustment to operating earnings.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P89_S1	Changes to contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to discount rates, accretion of the discount rates due to the passage of time, changes in our estimates of the likelihood or timing of achieving development or commercial milestones, changes in the probability of certain clinical events or changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P90_S0	The assumptions related to determining the value of contingent consideration include a significant amount of judgment, and any changes in the underlying estimates could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense recorded in any given period.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P91_S0	The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P91_S1	Realization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P91_S2	Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P92_S0	We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P92_S1	Our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P92_S2	These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income amongst various tax jurisdictions.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P92_S3	We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P92_S4	Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions, including estimating the ultimate resolution to intercompany pricing controversies between countries when there are numerous possible outcomes.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P92_S5	We review these tax uncertainties quarterly and adjust the liability as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as the progress of tax audits, lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues, and issuance of new legislation, regulations, or case law.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P93_S0	We measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards based on estimated fair values.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P94_S0	Stock-based awards consist of stock options, service-based restricted stock units, market-based restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units, and employee stock purchase subscriptions.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P94_S1	The fair value of each option award and employee stock purchase subscription is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P94_S2	The fair value of market-based restricted stock units is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which uses multiple input variables to determine the probability of satisfying the market condition requirements.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P94_S3	The Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo models require various highly judgmental assumptions, including stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected option term.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P94_S4	For performance-based restricted stock units, expense is recognized if and when we conclude that it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved, which requires judgment.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P95_S0	Stock-based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P95_S1	Judgment is required in estimating the stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited.
1099800_16_ITEM7_P95_S2	If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets, including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We manage these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Our investment strategy is focused on preserving capital and supporting our liquidity requirements, while earning a reasonable market return.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P1_S2	We invest in a variety of fixed-rate debt securities, primarily time deposits, commercial paper, U.S. government and agency securities, municipal securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, and municipal securities.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P1_S3	The market value of our investments may decline if current market interest rates rise.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P1_S4	As of December 31, 2015 , we had $858.0 million of investments in fixed-rate debt securities which had an average remaining term to maturity of approximately 0.8 years.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P1_S5	Taking into consideration the average maturity of our fixed-rate debt securities, a hypothetical 0.5% to 1.0% absolute increase in interest rates at December 31, 2015 would have resulted in a $3.5 million to $6.9 million decrease in the fair value of these investments.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P1_S6	Such a decrease would only result in a realized loss if we choose or are forced to sell the investments before the scheduled maturity, which we currently do not anticipate.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We are also exposed to interest rate risk on our debt obligations.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P2_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , we had $600.0 million of Notes outstanding that carry a fixed rate, and also had available a $750.0 million Credit Agreement that carries a variable interest rate based on the London interbank offered rate ("LIBOR").
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P2_S2	As of December 31, 2015 , there were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	To diversify our interest rate risk, we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300.0 million.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The critical terms of the swaps match the critical terms of $300.0 million of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, effectively converting that portion of the fixed-rate issue to a floating variable rate based on a 6-month LIBOR benchmark.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Based on our year end 2015 variable debt levels, a hypothetical 1.0% absolute increase in our floating market interest rates would increase our interest expense by approximately $3.0 million, most of which would be offset by increased returns on our short-term investments.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The impact on net interest would be immaterial to our financial condition and results of operations.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P5_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , a hypothetical 1.0% absolute increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of the fixed-rate debt by approximately $16.0 million.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P5_S1	This hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixed-rate debt.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P6_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P6_S1	These risks include the translation of local currency balances and results of our non-United States subsidiaries into United States dollars, currency gains and losses related to intercompany and third-party transactions denominated in currencies other than a location's functional currency, and currency gains and losses associated with intercompany loans.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P6_S2	Our principal currency exposures relate to the Euro and the Japanese yen.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P6_S3	Our objective is to minimize the volatility of our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and the use of derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options contracts.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P6_S4	The total notional amount of our derivative financial instruments entered into for foreign currency management purposes at December 31, 2015 was $1,061.6 million.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P6_S5	A hypothetical 10% increase/decrease in the value of the United States dollar against all hedged currencies would increase/decrease the fair value of these derivative contracts by $81.2 million and $83.7 million, respectively.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P6_S6	Any gains or losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions, so the net impact would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Derivative financial instruments involve credit risk in the event the financial institution counterparty should default.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P7_S1	It is our policy to execute such instruments with major financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P7_S2	At December 31, 2015 , all derivative financial instruments were with bank counterparties assigned investment grade ratings by national rating agencies.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P7_S3	We further diversify our derivative financial instruments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P7_S4	We have not experienced a counterparty default and do not anticipate any non-performance by our current derivative counterparties.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P8_S0	We invest excess cash in a variety of fixed-rate debt securities, and diversify the investments between financial institutions.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P8_S1	Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P9_S0	In the normal course of business, we provide credit to customers in the health care industry, perform credit evaluations of these customers, and maintain allowances for potential credit losses, which have historically been adequate compared to actual losses.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P9_S1	In 2015 , we had no customers that represent 10% or more of our total net sales or accounts receivable, net.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P10_S0	We continue to do business with foreign governments in certain European countries that have experienced a deterioration in credit and economic conditions.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P10_S1	These conditions have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a reduction in value and an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect accounts receivable outstanding in these countries.
1099800_16_ITEM7A_P10_S2	In addition, we may also be impacted by declines in sovereign credit ratings or sovereign defaults in these countries.

1099800_16_ITEM8_P22_S2	The Company validates the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from its distributors or an estimate of its distributor's inventory.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P22_S3	This distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P22_S4	The Company periodically monitors current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the credit for future distributor rebates is fairly stated.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P23_S0	The Company also offers volume rebates to certain group purchasing organizations ("GPOs") and customers based upon target sales levels.

1099800_16_ITEM8_P32_S0	The Company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer-specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P32_S1	When evaluating its allowances for doubtful accounts related to receivables from customers in certain European countries that have historically paid beyond the stated terms, the Company's analysis considers a number of factors including evidence of the customer's ability to comply with credit terms, economic conditions, and procedures implemented by the Company to collect the historical receivables.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P32_S2	Additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances, if economic conditions are less favorable than the Company has anticipated, or for customer-specific circumstances, such as financial difficulty.

1099800_16_ITEM8_P41_S0	The Company identifies its reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities, including existing goodwill, to those reporting units.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P41_S1	The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based on the Company's market capitalization and a market revenue multiple.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P41_S2	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, then the Company measures the amount of the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P41_S3	In 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , the Company did not record any impairment loss as the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its respective carrying value.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P42_S0	Indefinite-lived intangible assets relate to in-process research and development ("IPR D") acquired in business combinations.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P42_S1	The estimated fair values of IPR D projects acquired in a business combination which have not reached technological feasibility are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P42_S2	Upon successful completion of the project, the capitalized amount is amortized over its estimated useful life.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P42_S3	If the project is abandoned, all remaining capitalized amounts are written off immediately.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P43_S0	Indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually, or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.

1099800_16_ITEM8_P44_S0	IPR D projects acquired in an asset acquisition are expensed unless the project has an alternative future use.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P45_S0	Management reviews the carrying amounts of other finite-lived intangible assets and long-lived tangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P45_S1	Impairment indicators include, among other conditions, cash flow deficits, historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit, and adverse legal or regulatory developments.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P45_S2	If it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable, based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization periods, their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P46_S0	Estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P46_S1	For the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment, long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P47_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P47_S1	The Company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and adjusting the amount, if necessary.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P47_S2	The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are both historical experience and the Company's forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets.

1099800_16_ITEM8_P54_S0	The dilutive impact of the restricted stock units and in-the-money options is calculated based on the average share price for each fiscal period using the treasury stock method.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P54_S1	Under the treasury stock method, the amount that the employee must pay for exercising stock options, the amount of compensation expense for future service that the Company has not yet recognized, and the amount of tax benefits that would be recorded in " Additional Paid-in Capital " when the award becomes deductible are assumed to be used to repurchase shares.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P54_S2	Potential common share equivalents have been excluded where their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

1099800_16_ITEM8_P59_S1	Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period (vesting period) on a straight-line basis.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P59_S2	For performance-based restricted stock units, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense if and when the Company concludes that it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved, net of estimated forfeitures.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P59_S3	The Company reassesses the probability of vesting at each quarter end and adjusts the stock-based compensation expense based on its probability assessment.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P60_S0	Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P61_S0	Upon exercise of stock options or vesting of restricted stock units, the Company issues common stock.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P62_S0	Total stock-based compensation expense was as follows (in millions):
1099800_16_ITEM8_P63_S0	Upon retirement, all unvested stock options and performance-based restricted stock units are immediately forfeited.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P63_S1	In addition, upon retirement, a participant will immediately vest in 25% of service-based restricted stock units for each full year of employment with the Company measured from the grant date.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P63_S2	All remaining unvested service-based restricted stock units are immediately forfeited.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P64_S0	For market-based restricted stock units, upon retirement and in certain other specified cases, a participant will receive a pro-rated portion of the shares that would ultimately be issued based on attainment of the performance goals as determined on the vesting date.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P64_S1	The pro-rated portion is based on the participant's whole months of service with the Company during the performance period prior to the date of termination.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P65_S0	The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate and foreign currency risks.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P65_S1	It is the Company's policy not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P66_S0	The Company uses interest rate swaps to convert a portion of its fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P66_S1	These interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges and meet the shortcut method requirements under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P66_S2	Accordingly, changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P66_S3	The Company uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the changes due to currency rate movements in the amount of future cash flows associated with intercompany transactions and certain local currency expenses expected to occur within the next 13 months .
1099800_16_ITEM8_P66_S4	These foreign currency forward exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedges.

1099800_16_ITEM8_P67_S1	The Company uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to offset the transaction gains and losses associated with certain of these assets and liabilities.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P67_S2	The Company also uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect its net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P67_S3	These foreign currency forward exchange contracts are designated as net investment hedges.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P68_S0	All foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency option contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries, principally the Euro and the Japanese yen.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P69_S0	All derivative financial instruments are recognized at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P69_S1	For each derivative instrument that is designated and effective as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized immediately to earnings, and offsets the loss or gain on the underlying hedged item.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P69_S2	The gain or loss on fair value hedges is classified in net interest expense, as they hedge the interest rate risk associated with the Company's fixed-rate debt.

1099800_16_ITEM8_P71_S1	The Company reclassifies these gains and losses into earnings in the same period in which the underlying hedged transactions affect earnings.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P71_S2	The effective portions of net investment hedges are reported in " Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss " as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment, and would be reclassified into earnings if the underlying net investment is sold or substantially liquidated.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P71_S3	The ineffective portions of cash flow hedges and net investment hedges are recorded in current period earnings.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P71_S4	During 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , the Company did not record any gains or losses due to hedge ineffectiveness.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P71_S5	The gains and losses on derivative financial instruments for which the Company does not elect hedge accounting treatment are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in each period based upon the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P71_S6	Cash flows from net investment hedges are reported as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows, and cash flows from all other derivative financial instruments are reported as operating activities.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P72_S0	Derivative financial instruments involve credit risk in the event the counterparty should default.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P72_S1	It is the Company's policy to execute such instruments with global financial institutions that the Company believes to be creditworthy.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P72_S2	The Company diversifies its derivative financial instruments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.

1099800_16_ITEM8_P73_S0	In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an amendment to the accounting guidance on income taxes impacting the presentation of deferred income taxes.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P73_S1	The guidance requires an entity to classify deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P73_S2	The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods therein, with early adoption allowed.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P73_S3	The Company early adopted this guidance and has applied the guidance retrospectively to all periods presented.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P74_S0	The impact on the December 31, 2014 balance sheet was a reclassification of $63.5 million from current " Deferred Income Taxes " and $8.3 million from " Accrued and Other Liabilities " to long-term "Deferred Income Taxes " (increase of $62.2 million ) and " Other Long-term Liabilities " (increase of $7.0 million ).
1099800_16_ITEM8_P75_S0	In January 2016, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting guidance on financial instruments.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P75_S1	The guidance primarily affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P75_S2	In addition, the FASB clarified guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P75_S3	The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P75_S4	The Company is currently assessing the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P76_S0	In September 2015, the FASB issued an update to the guidance on business combinations.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P76_S1	The new guidance requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P76_S2	The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P76_S3	The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P77_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued an update to the accounting guidance on inventory.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P77_S1	The new guidance requires an entity to measure inventory within the scope of the amendment at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P77_S2	Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P77_S3	The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years.

1099800_16_ITEM8_P80_S1	In August 2015, the FASB clarified that for a line-of-credit arrangement, a company can continue to defer and present debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortize the debt issuance costs over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, whether or not there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P80_S2	The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2015 and interim periods within those periods, and must be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P80_S3	The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P81_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued an update to the accounting guidance on revenue recognition.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P81_S1	The new guidance provides a comprehensive, principles-based approach to revenue recognition, and supersedes most previous revenue recognition guidance.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P82_S0	The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P82_S1	The guidance also requires improved disclosures on the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P82_S2	In August 2015, the FASB issued an update to the accounting guidance to defer the effective date by one year, such that the new standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods therein.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P82_S3	The new guidance can be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented, or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of the change recognized at the date of the initial application.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P82_S4	The Company is currently assessing the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements, and has not yet selected a transition method.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P83_S0	In May 2014, the Company entered into an agreement with Medtronic, Inc. and its affiliates ("Medtronic") to settle all outstanding patent litigation between the companies, including all cases related to transcatheter heart valves.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P83_S1	Pursuant to the agreement, all pending cases or appeals in courts and patent offices worldwide have been dismissed, and the parties will not litigate patent disputes with each other in the field of transcatheter valves for the eight -year term of the agreement.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P83_S2	Under the terms of a patent cross-license that is part of the agreement, Medtronic made a one-time, upfront payment to the Company in the amount of $750.0 million .
1099800_16_ITEM8_P83_S3	In addition, Medtronic will pay the Company quarterly license royalty payments through April 2022.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P83_S4	For sales in the United States, the royalty payments will be based on a percentage of Medtronic's sales of transcatheter aortic valves, subject to a minimum annual payment of $40.0 million and a maximum annual payment of $60.0 million .
1099800_16_ITEM8_P83_S5	A separate royalty payment will be calculated based on sales of Medtronic transcatheter aortic valves manufactured in the United States but sold elsewhere.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P84_S0	The Company accounted for the settlement agreement as a multiple-element arrangement and allocated the total consideration to the identifiable elements based upon their relative fair value.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P84_S1	The consideration assigned to each element was as follows (in millions):
1099800_16_ITEM8_P85_S0	The Company recognized the upfront payment of $750.0 million in " Intellectual Property Litigation Expenses (Income), net " during the second quarter of 2014.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P85_S1	The accounting guidance limits the amount to be recognized upfront to the amount of cash received.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P85_S2	The remaining fair value associated with the past damages element, as well as the license agreement and the covenant not to sue, will be recognized in " Net Sales " over the term of the license agreement as delivery occurs since the Company considers the future royalties to be part of its revenue-earning activities that constitute its ongoing major or central operations.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P86_S0	In February 2013, the Company received $83.6 million from Medtronic in satisfaction of the initial April 2010 jury award of damages for infringement of the United States Andersen transcatheter heart valve patent, including accrued interest.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P87_S0	The Company incurred external legal costs related to intellectual property litigation of $7.0 million , $9.6 million , and $22.1 million during 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively.

1099800_16_ITEM8_P89_S1	In connection with this acquisition, the Company recorded a $10.2 million IPR D charge, including related expenses.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P89_S2	The acquired technology has no alternative uses.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P89_S3	Additional design developments, bench testing, pre-clinical studies, and human clinical studies must be successfully completed prior to selling any product.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P89_S4	Under the terms of the purchase agreement, the Company must pay an additional $10.0 million if, within 9 years of the acquisition closing date, the Company receives CE Mark for a transcatheter mitral valve repair or replacement product that incorporates the acquired technology.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P90_S0	In March 2014, the Company recorded a $7.5 million charge to settle past and future obligations related to one of its intellectual property agreements.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P91_S0	In September 2014, due to a strategic shift of the Company's investment initiatives, the Company decided to refocus resources from its automated glucose monitoring program.

1099800_16_ITEM8_P100_S0	The Company has a number of equity investments in privately and publicly held companies.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P100_S1	Investments in these unconsolidated affiliates are recorded in " Long-term Investments " on the consolidated balance sheets, and are as follows:
1099800_16_ITEM8_P101_S0	In December 2015, the Company made a $1.5 million investment in Harpoon Medical, Inc. ("Harpoon Medical").
1099800_16_ITEM8_P101_S1	As part of the agreement, the Company also paid $11.5 million , included in " Other Assets ," for an exclusive option to acquire Harpoon Medical for up to $250.0 million , depending upon the achievement of certain milestones and regulatory approvals.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P102_S0	Harpoon Medical is developing a surgical device for minimally invasive mitral valve repair and the treatment of mitral valve regurgitation that is currently in the clinical testing phase, and is financed primarily through equity investments.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P103_S0	In December 2014, the Company made a $10.0 million investment in one of its existing cost method investees, CardioKinetix, Inc. ("CardioKinetix"), for a total investment carrying value of $14.4 million .
1099800_16_ITEM8_P103_S1	As part of the agreement, the Company also paid $15.0 million , included in " Other Assets, " for an exclusive option to acquire CardioKinetix for up to $375.0 million , depending upon the achievement of certain milestones and regulatory approvals.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P104_S0	CardioKinetix is pioneering a catheter-based treatment for heart failure that is currently in the clinical testing phase, and is financed primarily through equity investments.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P105_S0	Harpoon Medical and CardioKinetix are VIEs; however, the Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs since the Company does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact their economic performance.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P105_S1	The Company made this determination based on the development stage of the VIEs' products; the Company's inability to exercise influence over the VIEs, based on the Company's ownership percentage and voting rights, as well as its lack of involvement in day-to-day operations and management decisions; and the fact that the option to acquire each of the VIEs is currently significantly out of the money.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P105_S2	Accordingly, the Company accounts for these investments as cost method investments.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P105_S3	The Company's maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with CardioKinetix and Harpoon Medical is limited to the carrying amount of its investment and the cost of the option to acquire each of these entities.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P106_S0	During 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , the gross realized gains or losses from sales of available-for-sale investments were not material.

1099800_16_ITEM8_P112_S1	The risks and uncertainties associated with completing development within a reasonable period of time include those related to the design, development, and manufacturability of the product, the success of pre-clinical and clinical studies, and the timing of regulatory approvals.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P112_S2	The valuation assumed $97.7 million of additional research and development expenditures would be incurred prior to the date of product introduction.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P112_S3	In the valuation, net cash inflows were modeled to commence in 2018.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P112_S4	Upon completion of development, the underlying research and development intangible asset will be amortized over its estimated useful life.

1099800_16_ITEM8_P217_S0	The valuation allowance of $45.2 million as of December 31, 2015 reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P217_S1	This allowance primarily relates to the net operating loss carryforwards of certain United States and non-United States subsidiaries, and to the deferred tax assets established for impairment losses on certain investments and for certain non-United States credit carryforwards.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P218_S0	A valuation allowance of $2.6 million has been provided for other-than-temporary impairments and unrealized losses related to certain investments that may not be recognized due to the uncertainty of the ready marketability of certain impaired investments.

1099800_16_ITEM8_P222_S0	The Company has $63.6 million of California research expenditure tax credits it expects to use in future periods.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P222_S1	The credits may be carried forward indefinitely.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P222_S2	Based upon anticipated future taxable income, the Company expects that it is more likely than not that all California research expenditure tax credits will be utilized, although the utilization of the full benefit is expected to occur over a number of years and into the distant future.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P222_S3	Accordingly, no valuation allowance has been provided.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P223_S0	The United States state net operating loss carryforwards include $3.5 million of losses attributable to windfall stock option deductions.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P223_S1	A net benefit of $0.2 million will be recorded to " Additional Paid-in Capital " when realized as a reduction to income taxes payable.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P224_S0	Approximately $8.1 million of the California research expenditure tax credit carryforwards are attributable to windfall stock option deductions and will be recorded as a benefit to " Additional Paid-in Capital " when realized as a reduction to income taxes payable.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P225_S0	Deferred income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries of approximately $1,789.7 million as of December 31, 2015 since these amounts are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P225_S1	It is not practicable to calculate the deferred taxes associated with these earnings because of the variability of multiple factors that would need to be assessed at the time of any assumed repatriation; however, foreign tax credits would likely be available to reduce federal income taxes in the event of distribution.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P225_S2	In making this assertion, the Company evaluates, among other factors, the profitability of its United States and foreign operations and the need for cash within and outside the United States, including cash requirements for capital improvement, acquisitions, market expansion, and stock repurchase programs.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P225_S3	The Company does not expect any earnings for certain of its other foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and records the tax impact in net income currently.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P226_S0	The Company has received tax incentives in Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Singapore, and Switzerland.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P226_S1	The tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rates favorably impacted earnings per diluted share for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 by $0.25 , $0.31 , and $0.22 , respectively.

1099800_16_ITEM8_P228_S0	A reconciliation of the United States federal statutory income tax rate to the Company's effective income tax rate is as follows (in millions):
1099800_16_ITEM8_P229_S0	The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 was lower than the rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily because the rate for December 31, 2014 included (1) $262.1 million of tax expense associated with a $750.0 million litigation settlement payment received from Medtronic in May 2014 (see Note 3) and (2) $4.8 million of tax benefits from the remeasurement of uncertain tax positions.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P230_S0	The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 included (1) an $8.4 million benefit for the full year 2012 federal research credit and (2) $31.3 million of tax expense associated with the $83.6 million litigation award received from Medtronic in February 2013 (see Note 3).
1099800_16_ITEM8_P231_S0	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the gross unrecognized tax benefits were $216.1 million and $192.3 million , respectively.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P231_S1	The Company estimates that these liabilities would be reduced by $40.6 million and $34.3 million , respectively, from offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes, and timing adjustments.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P231_S2	The net amounts of $175.5 million and $158.0 million , respectively, if not required, would favorably affect the Company's effective tax rate.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P232_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest, penalties, and foreign exchange, is as follows (in millions):
1099800_16_ITEM8_P233_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P233_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had accrued $10.7 million (net of $7.6 million tax benefit) of interest related to unrecognized tax benefits, and as of December 31, 2014 , the Company had accrued $6.8 million (net of $5.0 million tax benefit) of interest related to unrecognized tax benefits.

1099800_16_ITEM8_P236_S0	The Company strives to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P236_S1	While the Company has accrued for matters it believes are more likely than not to require settlement, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P236_S2	Furthermore, the Company may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise its right to appeal.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P236_S3	The uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues, and issuance of new legislation, regulations, or case law.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P236_S4	Management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from these uncertain tax positions.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P237_S0	At December 31, 2015 , all material state, local, and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2008.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P238_S0	The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has substantially completed its fieldwork for the 2009 through 2012 tax years.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P238_S1	However, the audits are currently in suspense pending finalization of an Advance Pricing Agreement ("APA") and Joint Committee of Taxation approval.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P239_S0	As noted above, the Company entered into an APA process between the Switzerland and United States governments for the years 2009 through 2015 covering transfer pricing matters.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P239_S1	The transfer pricing matters are significant to the Company's consolidated financial statements, and the final outcome and timing of the negotiations between the two governments is uncertain.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P240_S0	During 2014, the Company filed with the IRS a request for a pre-filing agreement associated with a tax return filing position on a portion of the litigation settlement payment received from Medtronic in May 2014 (see Note 3).
1099800_16_ITEM8_P240_S1	During the first quarter of 2015, the IRS accepted the pre-filing agreement into the pre-filing agreement program.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P240_S2	The finalization of the pre-filing agreement is still pending.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P240_S3	However, the Company made an advance payment of tax in December 2015 to prevent the further accrual of interest on any potential deficiency only and not to signify any potential agreement to a contrary position that may be taken by the IRS.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P241_S0	Management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from our uncertain tax positions.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P241_S1	Based upon the information currently available and numerous possible outcomes, we cannot reasonably estimate what, if any, changes in our existing uncertain tax positions may occur in the next 12 months and thus have recorded the gross uncertain tax positions as a long-term liability.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P241_S2	However, if the APA and/or pre-filing agreement is finalized in the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that these events could result in a significant change in our uncertain tax positions within the next 12 months.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P242_S0	On October 30, 2015, Boston Scientific Scimed, Inc., a subsidiary of Boston Scientific Corporation ( Boston Scientific ), filed a lawsuit in the district court in D sseldorf, Germany against Edwards Lifesciences and its German subsidiary, Edwards Lifesciences Services GmbH, alleging that Edwards Lifesciences SAPIEN 3 heart valve infringes certain claims of a Boston Scientific German national patent arising from EP 2 749 254 B1 (the 254 patent ) related to paravalvular sealing technology.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P242_S1	The complaint seeks unspecified money damages and injunctive relief.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P242_S2	The Company intends to defend itself vigorously in this matter.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P243_S0	On November 2, 2015, Edwards Lifesciences LLC, a U.S. subsidiary of Edwards Lifesciences, filed a lawsuit against Sadra Medical, Inc. and Boston Scientific Scimed, Inc., two subsidiaries of Boston Scientific, in the United Kingdom in the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division, Patents Court to declare invalid and revoke the U.K. national patent corresponding to the 254 patent.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P243_S1	On January 15, 2016, these subsidiaries filed a counterclaim against Edwards Lifesciences and three of its European subsidiaries alleging that the SAPIEN 3 heart valve infringes certain claims of the same patent and seeking unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P244_S0	On November 23, 2015, Edwards Lifesciences PVT, Inc., a U.S. subsidiary of Edwards Lifesciences, filed a lawsuit in the district court in D sseldorf, Germany for patent infringement against Boston Scientific and a German subsidiary, Boston Scientific Medizintechnik GmbH, alleging that the Lotus heart valve infringes certain claims of Edwards Lifesciences German national patents EP 1 441 672 B1 and 2 255 753 B1 related to prosthetic valve and delivery system technology.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P244_S1	The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P245_S0	In addition, Edwards Lifesciences is or may be a party to, or may otherwise be responsible for, pending or threatened lawsuits related primarily to products and services currently or formerly manufactured or performed, as applicable, by Edwards Lifesciences.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P245_S1	Such cases and claims raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the facts and circumstances of each particular case or claim, the jurisdiction in which each suit is brought, and differences in applicable law.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P245_S2	Upon resolution of any such legal matter or other claim, Edwards Lifesciences may incur charges in excess of established reserves.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P245_S3	The Company is not able to estimate the amount or range of any loss for legal contingencies for which there is no reserve or additional loss for matters already reserved.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P245_S4	While any such charge related to matters could have a material adverse impact on Edwards Lifesciences' net income or cash flows in the period in which it is recorded or paid, management does not believe that any such charge relating to any currently pending lawsuit would have a material adverse effect on Edwards Lifesciences' financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P246_S0	Edwards Lifesciences is subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside of the United States.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P247_S0	The operations of Edwards Lifesciences, like those of other medical device companies, involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P247_S1	While it is difficult to quantify the potential impact of continuing compliance with environmental protection laws, management believes that such compliance will not have a material impact on Edwards Lifesciences' financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P248_S0	Edwards Lifesciences conducts operations worldwide and is managed in the following geographical regions: United States, Europe, Japan, and Rest of World.

1099800_16_ITEM8_P249_S0	The Company's geographic segments are reported based on the financial information provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (the Chief Executive Officer).
1099800_16_ITEM8_P249_S1	The Company evaluates the performance of its geographic segments based on net sales and income before provision for income taxes ("pre-tax income").
1099800_16_ITEM8_P249_S2	The accounting policies of the segments are substantially the same as those described in Note 2.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P250_S0	Segment net sales and segment pre-tax income are based on internally derived standard foreign exchange rates, which may differ from year to year, and do not include inter-segment profits.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P250_S1	Because of the interdependence of the reportable segments, the operating profit as presented may not be representative of the geographical distribution that would occur if the segments were not interdependent.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P251_S0	Net sales by geographic area are based on the location of the customer.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P252_S0	Certain items are maintained at the corporate level and are not allocated to the segments.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P252_S1	The non-allocated items include net interest expense, global marketing expenses, corporate research and development expenses, manufacturing variances, corporate headquarters costs, special gains and charges, stock-based compensation, foreign currency hedging activities, certain litigation costs, and most of the Company's amortization expense.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P252_S2	Although most of the Company's depreciation expense is included in segment pre-tax income, due to the Company's methodology for cost build-up, it is impractical to determine the amount of depreciation expense included in each segment, and, therefore, a portion is maintained at the corporate level.
1099800_16_ITEM8_P253_S0	The Company neither discretely allocates assets to its operating segments, nor evaluates the operating segments using discrete asset information.

1099800_17_ITEM1_P55_S0	We own certain United States registered trademarks used in our business.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P55_S1	Many of our trademarks have also been registered for use in certain foreign countries where registration is available and where we have determined it is commercially advantageous to do so.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P56_S0	Our products and facilities are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, including the U.S. FDA, European Community Notified Bodies, and the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, to confirm compliance with the various laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, and distribution of our products.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P56_S1	We are also governed by federal, state, local, and international laws of general applicability, such as those regulating employee health and safety, and the protection of the environment.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P56_S2	Overall, the amount and scope of domestic and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our business has increased over time.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P57_S0	In the United States, the FDA has responsibility for regulating medical devices.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P57_S1	The FDA regulates design, development, testing, clinical studies, manufacturing, labeling, promotion, and record keeping for medical devices, and reporting of adverse events, recalls, or other field actions by manufacturers and users to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P57_S2	Many of the devices that we develop and market are in a category for which the FDA has implemented stringent clinical investigation and pre-market clearance or approval requirements.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P58_S0	The process of obtaining FDA clearance or approval to market a product is resource intensive, lengthy, and costly.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P58_S1	FDA review may involve substantial delays that adversely affect the marketing and sale of our products.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P58_S2	A number of our products are pending regulatory clearance or approval to begin commercial sales in various markets.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P58_S3	Ultimately, the FDA may not authorize the commercial release of a medical device if it determines the device is not safe and effective or does not meet other standards for clearance.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P58_S4	Additionally, even if a product is cleared or approved, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of these products once commercialized.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P59_S0	The FDA has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order the repair, replacement, or refund of the costs of such devices, or preclude the importation of devices that are or appear violative.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P59_S1	The FDA also conducts inspections to determine compliance with the quality system regulations concerning the manufacturing and design of devices and current medical device reporting regulations, recall regulations, clinical testing regulations, and other requirements.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P59_S2	The FDA may withdraw product clearances or approvals due to failure to comply with regulatory standards, or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval, and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P59_S3	Additionally, the failure to comply with FDA or comparable regulatory standards or the discovery of previously unknown product problems could result in fines, delays, or suspensions of regulatory clearances or approvals, seizures, injunctions, recalls, refunds, civil money penalties, or criminal prosecution.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P59_S4	Our compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P59_S5	Moreover, the FDA and several other United States agencies administer controls over the export of medical devices from the United States and the import of devices into the United States, which could also subject us to sanctions for noncompliance.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P60_S0	We are also subject to additional laws and regulations that govern our business operations, products, and technologies, including:
1099800_17_ITEM1_P61_S0	the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which can be used to prosecute companies in the United States for arrangements with foreign government officials or other parties outside the United States.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P62_S0	Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal liability, significant fines or penalties, negative publicity, and substantial costs and expenses associated with investigation and enforcement activities.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P63_S0	To assist in our compliance efforts, we adhere to many codes of ethics and conduct regarding our sales and marketing activities in the United States and other countries in which we operate.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P63_S1	In addition, we have in place a dedicated team to improve our internal business compliance programs and policies.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P64_S0	Internationally, the regulation of medical devices is complex.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P64_S1	In Europe, our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P64_S2	The regulatory regime in the European Union for medical devices became mandatory in June 1998.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P64_S3	It requires that medical devices may only be placed on the market if they do not compromise safety and health when properly installed, maintained, and used in accordance with their intended purpose.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P65_S0	National laws conforming to the European Union's legislation regulate our products under the medical devices regulatory system.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P65_S1	Although the more variable national requirements under which medical devices were formerly regulated have been substantially replaced by the European Union Medical Devices Directive, individual nations can still impose unique requirements that may require supplemental submissions.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P66_S0	The European Union medical device laws require manufacturers to declare that their products conform to the essential regulatory requirements after which the products may be placed on the market bearing the CE Mark.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P66_S1	Manufacturers' quality systems for products in all but the lowest risk classification are also subject to certification and audit by an independent notified body.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P67_S0	In Europe, particular emphasis is being placed on more sophisticated and faster procedures for the reporting of adverse events to the competent authorities.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P68_S0	In Japan, pre-market approval and clinical studies are required as is governmental pricing approval for medical devices.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P68_S1	Clinical studies are subject to a stringent "Good Clinical Practices" standard.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P68_S2	Approval time frames from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare vary from simple notifications to review periods of one or more years, depending on the complexity and risk level of the device.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P68_S3	In addition, importation of medical devices into Japan is subject to the "Good Import Practices" regulations.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P68_S4	As with any highly regulated market, significant changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect future sales.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P69_S0	In many of the other foreign countries in which we market our products, we may be subject to regulations affecting, among other things:
1099800_17_ITEM1_P70_S0	Many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the FDA.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P70_S1	In some regions, the level of government regulation of medical devices is increasing, which can lengthen time to market and increase registration and approval costs.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P71_S0	In many countries, the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed and considered eligible for reimbursement.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P72_S0	Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs, including price regulation and competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness reviews, technology assessments, and managed-care arrangements, are continuing in many countries where we do business, including the United States, Europe, and Japan.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P72_S1	As a result of these changes, the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical therapies.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P72_S2	For example, government programs, private health care insurance, and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by restricting coverage and limiting the level of reimbursement for procedures or treatments, and some third-party payors require their pre-approval before new or innovative devices or therapies are utilized by patients.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P72_S3	These various initiatives have created increased price sensitivity over medical products generally and may impact demand for our products and technologies.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P73_S0	The delivery of our products is subject to regulation by the Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") in the United States and comparable state and foreign agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P73_S1	Foreign governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P74_S0	Reimbursement schedules regulate the amount the United States government will reimburse hospitals and doctors for the inpatient care of persons covered by Medicare.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P74_S1	HHS' Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services may also review whether and/or under what circumstances a procedure or technology is reimbursable for Medicare beneficiaries.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P75_S0	Changes in current reimbursement levels could have an adverse effect on market demand and our pricing flexibility.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P76_S0	Health care cost containment efforts have also prompted domestic hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power, and this trend is expected to continue.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P76_S1	The medical device industry has also experienced some consolidation, partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P76_S2	As a result, transactions with customers are larger, more complex, and tend to involve more long-term contracts than in the past.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P76_S3	These larger customers, due to their enhanced purchasing power, may attempt to increase the pressure on product pricing.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P77_S0	In 2010, significant reforms to the health care system were adopted as law in the United States.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P77_S1	The law includes provisions that, among other things, reduce or limit Medicare reimbursement, require all individuals to have health insurance (with limited exceptions), and impose increased taxes.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P77_S2	Specifically, the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize health care reform in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on United States sales of most medical devices.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P77_S3	The excise tax, which increased our operating expenses, was suspended for calendar years 2016 and 2017, but is scheduled to resume in 2018.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P78_S0	The long term impact of the payment reform provisions in the 2010 health care law remains uncertain to us as these programs continue to evolve.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P79_S0	medical procedure volumes, lower reimbursement for our products, and impact the demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P80_S0	In late 2016, legislation was signed into law that, among other things, increases funding for medical research and eases the development and approval of experimental treatments.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P80_S1	Known as the 21 st Century Cures Act, the law also provides new funding for the National Institutes of Health and the FDA.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P80_S2	Although it will take some time to be fully implemented, the 21 st Century Cures Act could help accelerate the discovery, development, and delivery of medical advancements to ensure more timely access to new treatments and cures for patients in need.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P81_S0	Our quarterly net sales are influenced by many factors, including new product introductions, acquisitions, regulatory approvals, patient and physician holiday schedules, and other factors.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P81_S1	Net sales in the third quarter are typically lower than other quarters of the year due to the seasonality of the United States and European markets, where summer vacation schedules normally result in fewer medical procedures.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P82_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , we had approximately 11,100 employees worldwide, the majority of whom were located in the United States, the Dominican Republic, Singapore, and Puerto Rico.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P82_S1	Other major concentrations of employees are located in Europe and Japan.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P83_S0	We emphasize competitive compensation, benefits, equity participation, and a positive and attractive work environment in our efforts to attract and retain qualified personnel, and employ a rigorous talent management system.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P83_S1	None of our North American employees are represented by a labor union.
1099800_17_ITEM1_P83_S2	In various countries outside of North America, we interact with trade unions and work councils that represent a limited number of employees.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our business and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	An investor should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P0_S3	If any of these events or circumstances occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be materially harmed.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P0_S4	In that case, the value of our securities could decline and an investor could lose part or all of his or her investment.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P0_S5	In addition, forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws that are contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in our other filings or statements may be subject to the risks described below as well as other risks and uncertainties.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P0_S6	Please read the cautionary notice regarding forward-looking statements in Item 1, "Business," above.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our products may become obsolete and our operating results may suffer.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The cardiovascular products industry is characterized by technological changes, frequent new product introductions, and evolving industry standards.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Without the timely introduction of new and improved products, our products could become technologically obsolete or more susceptible to competition and our revenue and operating results would suffer.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Even if we are able to develop new or improved products, our ability to market them could be limited by the need for regulatory clearance, restrictions imposed on approved indications, entrenched patterns of clinical practice, uncertainty over third-party reimbursement, or other factors.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P2_S3	We devote significant financial and other resources to our research and development activities; however, the research and development process is prolonged and entails considerable uncertainty.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Accordingly, products we are currently developing may not complete the development process or obtain the regulatory or other approvals required to market such products in a timely manner or at all.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Technical innovations often require substantial time and investment before we can determine their commercial viability.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We may not have the financial resources necessary to fund all of these projects.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P3_S2	In addition, even if we are able to successfully develop new or improved products, they may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development, and they may be rendered obsolete or less competitive by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products with newer technologies or features or other factors.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We may experience supply interruptions that could harm our ability to manufacture products.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We use a broad range of raw and organic materials and other items in the design and manufacture of our products.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our Surgical and Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy products are manufactured from treated natural animal tissue and man-made materials.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Our non-implantable products are manufactured from man-made raw materials including resins, chemicals, electronics, and metals.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P5_S3	We purchase certain of the materials and components used in the manufacture of our products from external suppliers, and we purchase certain supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance, cost-effectiveness, availability, or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P5_S4	We also contract with third parties for important services related to infrastructure and information technology.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P5_S5	General economic conditions could adversely affect the financial viability of our suppliers, resulting in their inability to provide materials and components used in the manufacture of our products.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P5_S6	While we work closely with suppliers to monitor their financial viability, assure continuity of supply, and maintain high quality and reliability, these efforts may not be successful.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P5_S7	In addition, due to the rigorous regulations and requirements of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products (including the need for approval of any change in supply arrangements), we may have difficulty establishing additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or at all if the need arises.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P5_S8	Certain suppliers may also elect to no longer service medical device companies due to the high amount of requirements and regulation.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P5_S9	Although alternative supplier options are considered and identified, we typically do not pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships and the time and expense associated with the regulatory validation process.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P5_S10	A change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to product performance or incorporate unique technology, and the loss of any existing supply contract could have a material adverse effect on us.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Regulatory agencies in the United States or other international geographies from time to time have limited or banned the use of certain materials used in the manufacture of our products.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In these circumstances, transition periods typically provide time to arrange for alternative materials.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	In addition, the SEC enacted disclosure rules regarding products that may contain certain minerals that originate from conflict areas in and around the Democratic Republic of Congo.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P6_S3	If our suppliers cannot verify that their components do not originate from these conflict areas, we may need to source components from alternative suppliers.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P6_S4	If we are unable to identify alternative materials or suppliers and secure approval for their use in a timely manner, our business could be harmed.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Some of our suppliers are located outside the United States.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	As a result, trade or regulatory embargoes imposed by foreign countries or the United States could result in delays or shortages that could harm our business.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	If we or one of our suppliers or logistics partners encounters manufacturing, logistics, or quality problems, including as a result of natural disasters, our business could suffer.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls, due in part to rigorous regulatory requirements.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	In addition, quality is extremely important due to the serious and costly consequences of a product failure.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Problems can arise during the manufacturing process for a number of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow protocols and procedures, raw material problems, software problems, or human error.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Although closely managed, disruptions can occur during implementation of new equipment and systems to replace aging equipment, as well as during production line transfers and expansions.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P9_S4	As we expand into new markets, we may face unanticipated surges in demand which could strain our production capacity.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P9_S5	If these problems arise or if we otherwise fail to meet our internal quality standards or those of the FDA or other applicable regulatory body, which include detailed record-keeping requirements, our reputation could be damaged, we could become subject to a safety alert or a recall, we could incur product liability and other costs, product approvals could be delayed, and our business could otherwise be adversely affected.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	In addition, our manufacturing and warehousing facilities, as well as those of our suppliers and logistics partners, could be materially damaged by earthquakes, hurricanes, volcanoes, fires, and other natural disasters or catastrophic circumstances.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	While we believe that our exposure to significant losses from a catastrophic disaster could be partially mitigated by our ability to manufacture, store, and distribute some of our products at other facilities, the losses could have a material adverse effect on our business for an indeterminate period of time before this transition is complete and operates without significant disruption.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We may be required, from time to time, to recognize charges in connection with the write-down of our assets or dispositions of business operations or for other reasons.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	From time to time, we identify operations and products that are not performing at a level commensurate with the rest of our business.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We may seek to dispose of these underperforming operations or products.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We may also seek to dispose of other operations or products for strategic or other business reasons.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	terms, we may voluntarily cease operations related to that product.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Any of these events could result in charges, which could be substantial and which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We may not successfully identify and complete acquisitions or strategic alliances on favorable terms or achieve anticipated synergies relating to any acquisitions or alliances, and such acquisitions could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, require significant management resources, and require significant charges or write-downs.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We regularly explore potential acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies, services, or products, as well as potential strategic alliances.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates or appropriate partners with which to form alliances.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Even if we identify appropriate acquisition or alliance candidates, we may be unable to complete the acquisitions or alliances on favorable terms, if at all.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P15_S3	In addition, the process of integrating an acquired business, technology, service, or product into our existing operations could result in unforeseen difficulties and expenditures.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Integration of an acquired company often requires significant expenditures as well as significant management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our other businesses.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Moreover, we may not realize the anticipated financial or other benefits of an acquisition or alliance.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We may be required to take charges or write-downs in connection with acquisitions.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	In particular, acquisitions of businesses engaged in the development of new products may give rise to in-process research and development ("IPR D") assets.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P16_S2	To the extent that the value of these assets declines, we may be required to write down the value of the assets.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Also, in connection with certain asset acquisitions, we may be required to take an immediate charge related to acquired IPR D. Either of these situations could result in substantial charges, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Future acquisitions could also involve the issuance of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization of expenses related to other intangible assets, any of which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	In addition, equity or debt financing required for such acquisitions may not be available.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We face intense competition, and if we do not compete effectively, our business will be harmed.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The cardiovascular medical device industry is highly competitive.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We compete with many companies, some of which are larger and have longer operating histories, better brand or name recognition, and broader product offerings.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Our customers consider many factors when selecting a product, including product reliability, breadth of product line, clinical outcomes, product availability, price, availability and rate of reimbursement, and services provided by the manufacturer.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P19_S3	In addition, our ability to compete will depend in large part on our ability to develop and acquire new products and technologies, anticipate technology advances, and keep pace with other developers of cardiovascular therapies and technologies.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Our sales, technical, and other key personnel play an integral role in the development, marketing, and selling of new and existing products.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	If we are unable to recruit, hire, develop, and retain a talented, competitive workforce, our ability to compete may be adversely affected.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Our competitive position can also be adversely affected by product problems, physician advisories, and safety alerts, reflecting the importance of quality in the medical device industry.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Our position can shift as a result of any of these factors.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P20_S3	In addition, given the trend toward value-based healthcare, if we are not able to continue to demonstrate the full value of our products to healthcare providers and payors, our competitive position could be adversely affected.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P20_S4	See " Competition " under " Business " included herein.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Unsuccessful clinical trials or procedures relating to products under development could have a material adverse effect on our prospects.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The regulatory approval process for new products and new indications for existing products requires extensive clinical trials and procedures, including early clinical feasibility and regulatory studies.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from current or future clinical trials or procedures conducted by us, our competitors, or third parties, or perceptions regarding this clinical data, could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary approvals and the market's view of our future prospects.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Such clinical trials and procedures are inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that these trials or procedures will be completed in a timely or cost-effective manner or result in a commercially viable product or expanded indication.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Failure to successfully complete these trials or procedures in a timely and cost-effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our prospects.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Clinical trials or procedures may experience significant setbacks even after earlier trials have shown promising results.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Further, preliminary results from clinical trials or procedures may be contradicted by subsequent clinical analysis.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	In addition, results from our clinical trials or procedures may not be supported by actual long-term studies or clinical experience.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P23_S3	If preliminary clinical results are later contradicted, or if initial results cannot be supported by actual long-term studies or clinical experience, our business could be adversely affected.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Clinical trials or procedures may be delayed, suspended, or terminated by us, the FDA, or other regulatory authorities at any time if it is believed that the trial participants face unacceptable health risks or any other reasons.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The success of many of our products depends upon strong relationships with certain key physicians.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The development, marketing, and sale of many of our products requires us to maintain working relationships with physicians upon whom we rely to provide considerable knowledge and experience.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	These physicians may assist us as researchers, marketing consultants, product trainers and consultants, inventors, and as public speakers.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P25_S2	If new laws, regulations, or other developments limit our ability to maintain strong relationships with these professionals or to continue to receive their advice and input, the development and marketing of our products could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	General economic and political conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	External factors can affect our profitability and financial condition.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Such external factors include general domestic and global economic conditions, such as interest rates, tax rates, and factors affecting global economic stability, and the political environment regarding health care in general.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P27_S2	The strength and timing of the current economic recovery remains uncertain, and we cannot predict to what extent the global economic conditions may negatively impact our business.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P27_S3	For example, negative conditions in the credit and capital markets could impair our ability to access the financial markets for working capital or other funds, and could negatively impact our ability to borrow.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P27_S4	An increase in interest rates could result in an increase in our borrowing costs and could otherwise restrict our ability to access the capital markets.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P27_S5	Such conditions could result in decreased liquidity and impairments in the carrying value of our investments, and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P27_S6	These and other conditions could also adversely affect our customers, and may impact their ability or decision to purchase our products or make payments on a timely basis.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	In 2010, significant reforms to the health care system were adopted as law in the United States.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The law includes provisions that, among other things, reduce or limit Medicare reimbursement, require all individuals to have health insurance (with limited exceptions), and impose increased taxes.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Specifically, the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize health care reform in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on United States sales of most medical devices.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P28_S3	The excise tax, which increased our operating expenses, was suspended for calendar years 2016 and 2017, but is scheduled to resume in 2018.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The long term impact of the payment reform provisions in the 2010 health care law remains uncertain to us as these programs continue to evolve.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	This law or any future legislation, including deficit reduction legislation, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and prospects if they were to impact the demand for our products or pricing, or result in cuts to, or a restructuring of, entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our business is subject to economic, political, and other risks associated with international sales and operations, including risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Because we sell our products in a number of countries, our business is subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including risks associated with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Our net sales originating outside the United States, as a percentage of total net sales, were 45% in 2016 .
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P31_S2	We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P31_S3	In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the United States.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Substantially all of our sales outside of the United States are denominated in local currencies, principally in Europe (and primarily denominated in the Euro) and in Japan.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	The United States dollar value of our international sales varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Decreases in the value of the United States dollar to the Euro or the Japanese yen, as well as other currencies, have the effect of increasing our reported revenues even when the volume of international sales has remained constant.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Increases in the value of the United States dollar relative to the Euro or the Japanese yen, as well as other currencies, have the opposite effect.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P32_S4	Significant increases or decreases in the value of the United States dollar could have a material effect on our revenues, cost of sales, and results of operations.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P32_S5	We have a hedging program for certain currencies that attempts to manage currency exchange rate risks to an acceptable level based on management's judgment of the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity, and cost; however, this hedging program does not completely eliminate the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act, and similar laws in other jurisdictions contain prohibitions against bribery and other illegal payments, and make it an offense to fail to have procedures in place that prevent such payments.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Recent years have seen an increasing number of investigations and other enforcement activities under these laws.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Although we have compliance programs in place with respect to these laws, which may be used as a defense to prove we had adequate procedures, no assurance can be given that a violation will not be found, and if found, the resulting penalties could adversely affect us and our business.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The stock market can be volatile and fluctuations in our quarterly sales and operating results as well as other factors could cause our financial guidance to vary from actual results and our stock price to decline.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	From time to time, the stock market experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P35_S1	This volatility can have a significant effect on the market prices of securities for reasons unrelated to underlying performance.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P35_S2	These broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect our stock price, regardless of our operating results.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P35_S3	In addition, the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in response to any of the other risk factors set out above and below, as well as a number of other factors, including the performance of comparable companies or the medical device industry, or changes in financial estimates and recommendations of securities analysts.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P36_S1	A high proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to significant selling, research and development, and manufacturing costs.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Thus, small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter, and the price of our common stock could fall.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Other factors that could affect our quarterly sales and operating results include:
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	our ability to expand our operations and the amount and timing of expansion-related expenditures.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The quarterly and full-year financial guidance we provide to investors and analysts with insight to our view of our future performance is based on assumptions about our sales and operating results.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Due to the nature of our business and the numerous factors that can impact our sales and operating performance, including those described above, our financial guidance may vary from actual results.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P38_S2	If we fail to meet any financial guidance that we provide, or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance during the year, the price of our common stock could decline.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The health care industry has been consolidating, and organizations such as GPOs, independent delivery networks, and large single accounts, such as the United States Veterans Administration, continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for many of our health care provider customers.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P40_S1	As a result, transactions with customers are larger and more complex, and tend to involve more long-term contracts.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P40_S2	The purchasing power of these larger customers has increased, and may continue to increase, causing downward pressure on product pricing.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P40_S3	If we are not one of the providers selected by one of these organizations, we may be precluded from making sales to its members or participants.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Even if we are one of the selected providers, we may be at a disadvantage relative to other selected providers that are able to offer volume discounts based on purchases of a broader range of medical equipment and supplies.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P40_S5	Further, we may be required to commit to pricing that has a material adverse effect on our revenues, profit margins, business, financial condition, and results of operations.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P40_S6	We expect that market demand, governmental regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide health care industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances, which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	If third-party payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or impose other cost containment measures to reduce reimbursement levels, our ability to profitably sell our products will be harmed.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We sell our products and technologies to hospitals and other health care providers, all of which receive reimbursement for the health care services provided to patients from third-party payors, such as government programs (both domestic and international), private insurance plans, and managed care programs.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P42_S1	The ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products from private and governmental third-party payors is critical to the success of medical technology companies.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P42_S2	The availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Reimbursement varies from country to country and can significantly impact acceptance of new products.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P43_S1	There can be no assurance that levels of reimbursement, if any, will not be decreased in the future, or that future legislation, regulation, or reimbursement policies of third-party payors will not otherwise adversely affect the demand for and price levels of our products.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The introduction of cost containment incentives, combined with closer scrutiny of health care expenditures by both private health insurers and employers, has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Hospitals or physicians may respond to such cost-containment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other therapies.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	care law could adversely affect reimbursement levels for our products, or otherwise adversely affect our product pricing and profitability.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs, including price regulation, are underway in several countries around the world.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P46_S1	In many countries, customers are reimbursed for our products under a government operated insurance system.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Under such a system, the government periodically reviews reimbursement levels and may limit patient access.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P46_S3	If a government were to decide to reduce reimbursement levels, our product pricing could be adversely affected.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods as determined by such third-party payors, or was used for an unapproved indication.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Third-party payors may also deny reimbursement for experimental procedures and devices.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We believe that many of our existing products are cost-effective, even though the one-time cost may be significant, because they are intended to improve quality of life and reduce overall health care costs over a long period of time.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P48_S1	We cannot be certain that these third-party payors will recognize these cost savings instead of merely focusing on the lower initial costs associated with competing therapies.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P48_S2	If our products are not considered cost-effective by third-party payors, our customers may not be reimbursed for them, resulting in lower sales of our products.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We may incur losses from product liability or other claims that could adversely affect our operating results.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, and marketing of medical devices.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Our products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P50_S2	In addition, many of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Component failures, manufacturing and assembly flaws, design defects, or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, patients.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Such problems could result in product liability, medical malpractice or other lawsuits and claims, safety alerts, or product recalls in the future, which, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and ability to attract and retain customers.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Product liability claims may be brought from time to time either by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P52_S1	We may incur charges related to such matters in excess of any established reserves and such charges, including the establishment of any such reserves, could have a material adverse impact on our net income and net cash flows.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Our inability to protect our intellectual property or failure to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of data or other sensitive company information, by cyber-attack or other event, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Our success and competitive position are dependent in part upon our proprietary intellectual property.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P54_S1	We rely on a combination of patents and trade secrets to protect our proprietary intellectual property, and we expect to continue to do so.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Although we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of means, we cannot guarantee that the protective steps we have taken are adequate to protect these rights.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged and held invalid.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P55_S1	In addition, as our patents expire, we may be unsuccessful in extending their protection through patent term extensions.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P55_S2	The expiration of, or the failure to maintain or extend our patents, could have a material adverse effect on us.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We also rely on confidentiality agreements with certain employees, consultants, and other third parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary information.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P56_S1	These agreements could be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for such a breach.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P56_S2	In addition, others could independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary information.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Our intellectual property, other proprietary technology, and other sensitive company information is dependent on sophisticated information technology systems and is potentially vulnerable to cyber-attacks, loss, damage, destruction from system malfunction, computer viruses, loss of data privacy, or misappropriation or misuse of it by those with permitted access, and other events.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P57_S1	While we have invested to protect our intellectual property and other information, and continue to work diligently to upgrade and enhance our systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns, breaches, cyber-attacks, or other events.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P57_S2	Such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, or results of operations.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We spend significant resources to enforce our intellectual property rights, sometimes resulting in litigation.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Intellectual property litigation is complex and can be expensive and time-consuming.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P58_S2	However, our efforts in this regard may not be successful.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P58_S3	We may not be able to detect infringement.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P58_S4	In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Patent litigation can result in substantial cost and diversion of effort.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P60_S0	may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, enabling our competitors to capture increased market position.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P60_S1	The invalidation of key intellectual property rights or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits filed to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or prospects.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P62_S0	During recent years, we and our competitors have been involved in substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P62_S1	From time to time, we have been and may in the future be forced to defend against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, and such intellectual property litigation is typically costly and time-consuming.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P62_S2	Adverse determinations in any such litigation could result in significant liabilities to third parties or injunctions that bar the sale of our products, or could require us to seek licenses from third parties and, if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms, prevent us from manufacturing, selling, or using certain products, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on us.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P62_S3	In addition, some licenses may be non-exclusive, which could provide our competitors access to the same technologies.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Third parties could also obtain patents that may require us to either redesign products or, if possible, negotiate licenses from such third parties.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Such licenses may materially increase our expenses.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P63_S2	If we are unable to redesign products or obtain a license, we might have to exit a particular product offering.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We and our customers are subject to rigorous governmental regulations and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products that are compatible with these regulations.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P64_S1	In addition, failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial sanctions which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P65_S0	The medical technologies we manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities, including regulations that cover the composition, labeling, testing, clinical study, design, sourcing, manufacturing, packaging, marketing, advertising, promotion, and distribution of our products.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P66_S0	We are required to register with the FDA as a device manufacturer.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P66_S1	As a result, we are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA's Quality System Regulation ("QSR") requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, design, quality control, and documentation procedures.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P66_S2	The FDA may also inspect our compliance with requirements related to adverse event reporting, recalls or corrections (field actions), the conduct of clinical studies, and other requirements.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P67_S0	In the European Union, we are required to maintain certain CE Mark and ISO certifications in order to sell our products, and are subject to periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P67_S1	If we or our suppliers fail to adhere to QSR, CE Mark, ISO, or similar requirements, this could delay or interrupt product production or sales and/or lead to fines, difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances, recalls, or other consequences, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or prospects.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Medical devices must receive FDA clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the United States.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P68_S1	In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of approved products that have been commercialized, and can prevent or limit further marketing of a product based upon the results of post-marketing programs.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P68_S2	In addition, the federal Medical Device Reporting regulations require us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P68_S3	Federal regulations also require us to report certain recalls or corrective actions to the FDA.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P68_S4	Furthermore, most major markets for medical devices outside the United States require clearance, approval, or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P68_S5	The process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device, particularly from the FDA and certain foreign governmental authorities, can be costly and time-consuming, and clearances or approvals may not be granted for products or product improvements on a timely basis, if at all.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P68_S6	Delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, clearances or approvals for products or product improvements could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations or prospects.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P69_S0	At any time after approval of a product for commercial sale, the FDA may conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with QSR requirements, and/or current Medical Device Reporting regulations, or other regulatory requirements.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Noncompliance with applicable requirements may subject us or responsible individuals to sanctions including civil money penalties, product seizure, injunction, or criminal prosecution.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P69_S2	In addition, the FDA may withhold or delay pre-market approval of our products until the noncompliance is resolved.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P69_S3	Product approvals by the FDA can also be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Regulatory agencies in the United States or other international geographies from time to time limit or ban the use of certain materials used in the manufacture of our products, require collection and disposal of products at the end of their lifecycle, and require disclosure of the origin of certain raw materials in our products.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P70_S1	Noncompliance with applicable requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P71_S0	The United States Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and similar laws in other jurisdictions, also impose reporting and disclosure requirements on device, pharmaceutical, and biologics companies for certain financial relationships with United States health care providers and teaching hospitals.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Failure to submit required information or submitting incorrect information may result in significant civil monetary penalties.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P72_S0	We are also subject to various United States and international laws pertaining to health care pricing, anti-corruption, and fraud and abuse, including prohibitions on kickbacks and the submission of false claims laws and restrictions on relationships with physicians and other referral sources.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P72_S1	These laws are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation, which could require us to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if we are found not to be in compliance.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P72_S2	Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions against us and our officers and employees, including substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in governmental health care programs.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Despite our implementation of robust compliance processes, we may be subject, from time to time, to inspections, investigations, and other enforcement actions by governmental authorities.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P73_S1	If we are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, the applicable governmental authority can impose fines, delay, suspend, or revoke regulatory clearances or approvals, institute proceedings to detain or seize our products, issue a recall, impose marketing or operating restrictions, enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against us or our officers or employees, and institute criminal prosecution.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P73_S2	Moreover, governmental authorities can ban or request the recall, repair, replacement, or refund of the cost of any device or product we manufacture or distribute.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P73_S3	Any of the foregoing actions could result in decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P73_S4	In addition to the sanctions for noncompliance described above, commencement of an enforcement proceeding, inspection, or investigation could divert substantial management attention from the operation of our business and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Our industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities, which may lead to greater governmental regulation in the future.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P75_S0	In recent years, the medical device industry has been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny, including by the FDA, numerous other federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities, as well as members of Congress.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P75_S1	This has included increased regulation, enforcement, inspections, and governmental investigations of the medical device industry and disclosure of financial relationships with health care professionals.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P75_S2	We anticipate that the government will continue to scrutinize our industry closely, and that additional regulation by governmental authorities, both foreign and domestic, may increase compliance costs, exposure to litigation, and other adverse effects to our operations.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We are subject to risks arising from concerns and/or regulatory actions relating to mad cow disease.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Certain of our products, including pericardial tissue valves, are manufactured using bovine tissue.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Concerns relating to the potential transmission of BSE, commonly known as "mad cow disease," from cows to humans may result in reduced acceptance of products containing bovine materials.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P78_S1	Certain medical device regulatory agencies have considered whether to continue to permit the sale of medical devices that incorporate bovine material.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P79_S0	We obtain bovine tissue only from closely controlled sources within the United States and Australia.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P79_S1	The bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valves is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility for the suspected BSE infectious agent.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P79_S2	We have not experienced any significant adverse impact on our sales as a result of concerns regarding BSE, but no assurance can be given that such an impact may not occur in the future.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Use of our products in unapproved circumstances could expose us to liabilities.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P81_S0	The marketing approval from the FDA and other regulators of certain of our products are, or are expected to be, limited to specific indications.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P81_S1	We are prohibited from marketing or promoting any unapproved use of our products.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P81_S2	Physicians, however, can use these products in ways or circumstances other than those strictly within the scope of the regulatory approval.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P81_S3	Although the product training we provide to physicians and other health care professionals is limited to approved uses or for clinical trials, no assurance can be given that claims might not be asserted against us if our products are used in ways or for procedures that are not approved.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Our operations are subject to environmental, health, and safety regulations that could result in substantial costs.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Our operations are subject to environmental, health, and safety laws, and regulations concerning, among other things, the generation, handling, transportation, and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes, the cleanup of hazardous substance releases, and emissions or discharges into the air or water.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P83_S1	We have incurred and may incur expenditures in the future in connection with environmental, health and safety laws, and regulations.
1099800_17_ITEM1A_P83_S2	New laws and regulations, violations of these laws or regulations, stricter enforcement of existing requirements, or the discovery of previously unknown contamination could require us to incur costs or could become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could be material.
1099800_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Dominican Republic lease expires in 2022; the Puerto Rico property has one lease that expires in 2017 and one that expires in 2018; the Costa Rica lease expires in 2021; the Horw, Switzerland lease expires in 2018; the Prague, Czech Republic lease expires in 2019; the Tokyo, Japan lease expires in 2018; the Shanghai, China lease expires in 2018; and Singapore has one land lease that expires in 2036 and one that expires in 2041.
1099800_17_ITEM2_P1_S0	We believe our properties have been well maintained, are in good operating condition, and are adequate for current needs.

1099800_17_ITEM5_P2_S1	Our current policy is to retain any future earnings for use in our business.
1099800_17_ITEM5_P3_S0	The difference between the total number of shares (or units) purchased and the total number of shares (or units) purchased as part of publicly announced plans or programs is due to shares withheld by us to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units issued to employees.
1099800_17_ITEM5_P4_S0	(b) On July 10, 2014, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to purchase on the open market, including pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan and in privately negotiated transactions, up to $750.0 million of our common stock.
1099800_17_ITEM5_P4_S1	On November 10, 2016, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program providing for an additional $1.0 billion of repurchases of our common stock.
1099800_17_ITEM5_P5_S0	In October 2016, our accelerated share repurchase ("ASR") agreement concluded and we received an additional 44 thousand shares of our common stock.
1099800_17_ITEM5_P5_S1	Shares purchased pursuant to the ASR agreement are presented in the table above in the periods in which they were received.

1099800_17_ITEM7_P0_S1	Also discussed is our financial position as of December 31, 2016 .
1099800_17_ITEM7_P0_S2	You should read this discussion in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	We are the global leader in patient-focused medical innovations for structural heart disease and critical care monitoring.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	Driven by a passion to help patients, we partner with the world's leading clinicians and researchers and aggressively invest in research and development to transform care for structural heart disease and critically ill patients.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P1_S2	We conduct operations worldwide and are managed in the following geographical regions: United States, Europe, Japan, and Rest of World.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P1_S3	Our products are categorized into the following main areas:
1099800_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy ("THVT"), Surgical Heart Valve Therapy ("SHVT"), and Critical Care.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	Our sales growth was led by our THVT products, which benefited from the launches of the Edwards SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve in the United States (July 2015), Europe (January 2014), and Japan (March 2016).
1099800_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	Our gross profit margin in 2016 was negatively impacted relative to 2015 by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, partially offset by an improved product mix, led by THVT products.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P3_S2	Our gross profit margin in 2015 benefited from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and an improved product mix, led by THVT products.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P3_S3	Our net income in 2016 increased compared to 2015 primarily due to increased sales, partially offset by an in-process research and development ("IPR D") charge for technology we acquired for use in our transcatheter heart valve programs.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P3_S4	Net income in 2014 benefited from the receipt of $750.0 million ($487.9 million, net of tax) for an upfront payment due under a litigation settlement agreement.

1099800_17_ITEM7_P4_S2	We are committed to developing new technologies and providing innovative patient care, and we are committed to defending our intellectual property in support of those developments.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P4_S3	In 2016 , we invested 15.0% of our net sales in research and development.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P4_S4	The following is a summary of important developments during 2016 :
1099800_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	we received FDA approval for an expanded indication study of the Edwards SAPIEN 3 valve.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	we received FDA approval to expand use of the Edwards SAPIEN XT transcatheter heart valve for pulmonic valve replacement procedures.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	we entered into an agreement to acquire Valtech, a privately held company based in Israel and developer of the Cardioband System for transcatheter repair of the mitral and tricuspid valves.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	We completed the acquisition on January 23, 2017.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P7_S2	We are dedicated to generating robust clinical, economic, and quality of life evidence increasingly expected by patients, clinicians, and payors in the current healthcare environment, with the goal of encouraging the adoption of innovative new medical therapies that demonstrate superior outcomes.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	International net sales include the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P8_S1	The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net sales is not necessarily indicative of the impact on net income due to the corresponding effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on international manufacturing and operating costs and our hedging activities.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	The increase in net sales of THVT products in the United States was due primarily to:
1099800_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	lower sales of the Edwards SAPIEN XT valve as customers converted to Edwards SAPIEN 3.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	The increase in international net sales of THVT products was due primarily to increased sales of the Edwards SAPIEN 3 valve, driven primarily by its launch in Europe in January 2014 and in Japan in March 2016.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	The increase in net sales of THVT products in the United States was due primarily to:
1099800_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	lower sales of the Edwards SAPIEN valve as customers converted to Edwards SAPIEN XT.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	The increase in international net sales of THVT products was due primarily to:
1099800_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $71.2 million, due primarily to the weakening of the Euro against the United States dollar.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	In March 2016, we received approval from the the FDA to expand use of the Edwards SAPIEN XT transcatheter heart valve for pulmonic valve replacement procedures.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P16_S1	The approval enables the treatment of adult and pediatric patients who suffer from either a narrowed pulmonary valve, or moderate or greater pulmonary regurgitation caused by congenital heart disease.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P16_S2	Also in March 2016, we received approval for SAPIEN 3 in Japan for the treatment of patients suffering from severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P16_S3	In August 2016, we received approval from the FDA, and in September 2016, we received CE Mark in Europe, to expand use of the Edwards SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve for the treatment of patients suffering from severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis who have been determined to be at intermediate risk for open-heart surgery.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P16_S4	In January 2017, we received FDA approval for EARLY-TAVR, our trial that will study patients diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis who have not yet developed symptoms.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P16_S5	Patients will be randomized to receive either transfemoral SAPIEN 3 or clinical surveillance.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	The decrease in net sales of SHVT products was due primarily to:
1099800_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which increased net sales by $2.2 million , due primarily to the strengthening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar, partially offset by the weakening of various currencies against the United States dollar.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	The decrease in net sales of SHVT products was due primarily to:
1099800_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	higher sales of (1) surgical heart valve products, driven by pericardial aortic tissue valves, primarily in Europe, Japan, and the United States, and (2) EDWARDS INTUITY Elite valves, primarily in Europe.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	In August 2016, the FDA approved our advanced EDWARDS INTUITY Elite Valve System , a rapid deployment device for surgical aortic valve replacement.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	In September 2016, we received CE Mark for our INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve, the first in a new class of resilient heart valves designed for potential future valve-in-valve procedures.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	The increase in net sales of Critical Care products was due primarily to:
1099800_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which increased net sales by $5.0 million due primarily to the strengthening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar, partially offset by the weakening of various currencies against the United States dollar.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	The decrease in net sales of Critical Care products was due primarily to:
1099800_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	higher sales of enhanced surgical recovery products in the United States, Europe, and Rest of World.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	In October 2016, we received CE Mark for our HPI, a technology that alerts clinicians to potential hypotension, or abnormally low blood pressure, in their surgical and critical care patients.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	HPI is enabled by the minimally invasive FloTrac IQ sensor, which also received CE Mark.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2016 was driven by:
1099800_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	a 1.6 percentage point increase in the United States, and a 0.5 percentage point increase in international markets, due to an improved product mix, driven by THVT products.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2015 was driven by:
1099800_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	multiple investments in our operations, including an increase in costs to improve our manufacturing processes.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	The increase in SG A expenses in 2016 resulted primarily from (1) higher sales and marketing expenses in the United States and Europe, mainly to support our THVT program, and (2) higher personnel-related costs.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P31_S1	These increases were partially offset by the suspension of the medical device excise tax in the United States, which was suspended for calendar years 2016 and 2017.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P31_S2	The decrease in SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2016 was due primarily to higher sales in the United States and Japan.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	The decrease in SG A expenses in 2015 resulted primarily from foreign currency, which reduced expenses by $61.1 million due primarily to the weakening of the Euro and the Japanese yen against the United States dollar.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	This decrease was partially offset by (1) higher sales and marketing expenses in Europe, the United States, and Japan, mainly to support our THVT program and (2) higher personnel-related costs.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P32_S2	The decrease in SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2015 was due primarily to higher sales in the United States, Europe, and Japan.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	The increase in R D expenses in 2016 was due primarily to mitral and aortic THVT product development efforts.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	The suspension of the United States medical device excise tax during 2016 provided additional flexibility to accelerate investments in structural heart initiatives.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	The increase in R D expenses in 2015 was due primarily to new THVT and SHVT product development efforts.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	These costs were partially offset by lower spending for THVT clinical trials.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	In May 2014, we entered into an agreement with Medtronic, Inc. ("Medtronic") to settle all outstanding patent litigation between the companies, and, pursuant to the agreement, we received an upfront payment from Medtronic in the amount of $750.0 million.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	We incurred external legal costs related to intellectual property litigation of $32.6 million , $7.0 million, and $9.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P36_S1	The increase in intellectual property litigation expenses in 2016 was due primarily to the first quarter resolution of an intellectual property litigation matter, and increased costs associated with ongoing litigation in the United States and Europe.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	Interest expense was $19.2 million , $17.2 million , and $17.2 million in 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P37_S1	The increase in interest expense for 2016 as compared to 2015 resulted primarily from higher average interest rates.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P37_S2	Interest expense for 2015 remained flat compared to 2014 as the impact of higher average interest rates was offset by a lower average debt balance compared to 2014.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	Interest income was $10.8 million , $7.9 million , and $6.4 million in 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P38_S1	The increase in interest income for 2016 resulted primarily from higher average interest rates.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P38_S2	The increase in interest income for 2015 resulted primarily from higher average investment balances and higher average interest rates.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	In March 2016, we contributed $5.0 million to the Edwards Lifesciences Foundation, a related-party not-for-profit organization intended to provide philanthropic support to health- and community-focused charitable organizations.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	The contribution was irrevocable and was recorded as an expense at the time of payment.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	The foreign exchange losses relate to the foreign currency fluctuations primarily in our intercompany receivable and payable balances, partially offset by the gains and losses on derivative instruments intended to hedge those exposures.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	The (gain) loss on investments represents our net share of gains and losses in investments accounted for under the equity method, and realized gains and losses on our available-for-sale and cost method investments.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	During 2014, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $3.5 million related to one of our cost method investments.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	In December 2014, we recorded a $4.0 million impairment charge related to a promissory note receivable because it was likely that we would be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the promissory note agreement.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	In March 2014, we recorded a $3.7 million insurance settlement gain related to inventory that was damaged in the fourth quarter of 2013.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	In September 2014, we committed to purchase our Draper, Utah facility under a purchase option provided in the lease agreement.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	Under the terms of the lease agreement, we accrued $1.0 million for certain lease contract termination costs.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	Our effective income tax rates for 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 were impacted as follows (in millions):
1099800_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the gross uncertain tax positions were $245.5 million and $216.1 million , respectively.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	We estimate that these liabilities would be reduced by $44.9 million and $40.6 million , respectively, from offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes, and timing adjustments.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P46_S2	The net amounts of $200.6 million and $175.5 million , respectively, if not required, would favorably affect our effective tax rate.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of uncertain tax positions, excluding interest, penalties, and foreign exchange, is as follows (in millions):
1099800_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , we had accrued $14.7 million (net of $10.8 million tax benefit) of interest related to uncertain tax positions, and as of December 31, 2015 , we had accrued $10.7 million (net of $7.6 million tax benefit) of interest related to uncertain tax positions.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P48_S2	During 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , we recognized interest expense, net of tax benefit, of $4.0 million , $3.9 million , and $2.3 million , respectively, in Provision for Income Taxes on the consolidated statements of operations.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	We strive to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P49_S1	While we have accrued for matters we believe are more likely than not to require settlement, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P49_S2	Furthermore, we may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise our right to appeal.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	The uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues, and issuance of new legislation, regulations, or case law.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P50_S1	Management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from our uncertain tax positions.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	At December 31, 2016 , all material state, local, and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2008.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has substantially completed its fieldwork for the 2009 through 2012 tax years.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P52_S1	However, the audits are currently in suspense pending a final determination with respect to a pending application for an Advance Pricing Agreement ("APA").
1099800_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	The IRS began its examination of the 2014 tax year during the fourth quarter of 2016.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	We have been pursuing an APA between the Switzerland and United States governments for the years 2009 through 2013 covering transfer pricing matters with the possibility of a roll-forward of the results to subsequent years.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P54_S1	These discussions remain ongoing as of December 31, 2016.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P54_S2	These transfer pricing matters are significant to our consolidated financial statements as the disputed amounts are material, and the final outcome is uncertain.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P54_S3	We continue to believe our positions are supportable.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2016, we received notification of preliminary agreement on methodology between the respective Competent Authorities for the requested APAs for 2015-2019 between the United States and Japan, Switzerland and Japan, and Singapore and Japan.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	These are expected to be formalized and executed during 2017.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	During 2014, we filed with the IRS a request for a pre-filing agreement associated with a tax return filing position on a portion of the litigation settlement payment received from Medtronic in May 2014.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P56_S1	During the first quarter of 2015, the IRS accepted the pre-filing agreement into the pre-filing agreement program.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P56_S2	The closing agreement for this matter was finalized during the fourth quarter of 2016.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P56_S3	There remains a disputed issue and we expect to enter the Fast-Track Appeals process during 2017.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P56_S4	We made an advance payment of tax in December 2015 solely to prevent the further accrual of interest on any potential deficiency, not to signify any potential agreement to a contrary position that may be taken by the IRS.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	Management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from our uncertain tax positions.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P57_S1	Based upon the information currently available and numerous possible outcomes, we cannot reasonably estimate what, if any, changes in our existing uncertain tax positions may occur in the next 12 months and thus have recorded the gross uncertain tax positions as a long-term liability.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P57_S2	However, if the APA and/or the appeals process related to the pre-filing agreement is finalized in the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that these events could result in a significant change in our uncertain tax positions within the next 12 months.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 was higher than the rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily because of fluctuations in the relative contribution of our foreign operations and United States operations to worldwide pre-tax income, offset by an increase in benefits from the federal and California research credits.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	We have received tax incentives in certain non-U.S. tax jurisdictions, the primary benefit of which will expire in 2024.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P59_S1	The tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rates were $77.4 million ( $0.32 per diluted share), $59.1 million ( $0.25 per diluted share), and $68.3 million ( $0.31 per diluted share) for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	Our DR branch receives tax incentives, including an exemption from paying DR income taxes, under a Free Trade Zone law.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P60_S1	Effective November 9, 2012, DR enacted a law which, among other tax provisions, would apply a 10% withholding tax on dividends or branch remittances from a Free Trade Zone company to its shareholder(s).
1099800_17_ITEM7_P60_S2	The DR withholding tax provision was, however, contingent upon certain future events.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P60_S3	On October 5, 2016, the DR Ministry of Finance published a notification confirming that the 10% withholding tax on branch remittances would be due and payable by DR Free Trade Zone companies for dividends and remittances paid on or after October 5, 2016.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P60_S4	As a result, we expect this action will increase our effective tax rate in 2017; however, the amount is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	Our sources of cash liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, amounts available under credit facilities, and cash from operations.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P61_S1	We believe that these sources are sufficient to fund the current requirements of working capital, capital expenditures, and other financial commitments for the next twelve months.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P61_S2	However, we periodically consider various financing alternatives and may, from time to time, seek to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held in the United States and outside the United States were $214.1 million and $1,057.0 million , respectively.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P62_S1	We believe that cash held in the United States, in addition to amounts available under credit facilities and cash from operations, are sufficient to fund our United States operating requirements for the next twelve months.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside the United States, the majority of which relates to undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, which are considered by us to be indefinitely reinvested, have historically been used to fund international operations and acquire businesses and assets outside of the United States.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	We consider making short-term loans of cash held outside the United States to the United States from time to time based on facts and circumstances.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P64_S1	The permanent repatriations of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside the United States are subject to restrictions in certain jurisdictions, and may be subject to withholding and other taxes.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P64_S2	The potential tax liability related to any repatriation would be dependent on the facts and circumstances that exist at the time such repatriation is made and the complexities of the tax laws of the United States and the respective foreign jurisdictions.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	On November 26, 2016, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger to acquire Valtech for approximately $340.0 million, subject to certain adjustments, in stock and cash to be paid at closing, with the potential for up to $350.0 million in additional pre-specified milestone-driven payments over the next 10 years.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P65_S1	Our acquisition of Valtech closed on January 23, 2017, and we issued an aggregate of approximately 2.8 million shares of our common stock, and paid approximately $84.3 million in cash to holders of Valtech securities.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P65_S2	Prior to the close of the transaction, Valtech spun off its early-stage transseptal mitral valve replacement technology program.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P65_S3	We have an option to acquire that program and its associated intellectual property for approximately $200.0 million, subject to certain adjustments.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	In December 2015, we purchased an exclusive option to acquire Harpoon Medical, Inc. ("Harpoon Medical") for up to $250.0 million, depending upon the achievement of certain milestones and regulatory approvals.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P66_S1	In December 2014, we purchased an exclusive option to acquire CardioKinetix, Inc. ("CardioKinetix") for up to $375.0 million, depending upon the achievement of certain milestones and regulatory approvals.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	On July 3, 2015, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger to acquire CardiAQ for an aggregate cash purchase price of $350.0 million, subject to certain adjustments, plus an additional $50.0 million if a certain European regulatory approval is obtained within 48 months of the acquisition closing date.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P67_S1	We closed the purchase in August 2015 with available cash on hand in the United States.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	We have a Five-Year Credit Agreement ("Credit Agreement") which provides up to an aggregate of $750.0 million in borrowings in multiple currencies.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P68_S1	We may increase the amount available under the Credit Agreement, subject to agreement of the lenders, by up to an additional $250.0 million in the aggregate.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P68_S2	As of December 31, 2016 , borrowings of $225.0 million were outstanding under the Credit Agreement, and have been classified as long-term obligations in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	In October 2013, we issued $600.0 million of 2.875% fixed-rate unsecured senior notes due October 15, 2018.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P69_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , the total carrying value of our long-term debt was $822.3 million .
1099800_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	We periodically repurchase shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P70_S1	We consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, expected dilution from stock plans, cash capacity, and the market price of our common stock.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P70_S2	During 2016 , under the Board authorized repurchase programs, we repurchased a total of 7.2 million shares at an aggregate cost of $646.5 million , including amounts purchased under accelerated share repurchase agreements, and as of December 31, 2016 , we had remaining authority to purchase $1,031.0 million of our common stock.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	Net cash flows provided by operating activities of $704.4 million for 2016 increased $154.7 million from 2015 due primarily to (1) improved operating performance and (2) lower supplier payments in 2016 compared to 2015, partially offset by (1) the impact of excess tax benefits from stock plans, primarily due to our increased stock price, and (2) an increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales, primarily in the United States.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	Net cash flows provided by operating activities of $549.7 million for 2015 decreased $472.6 million from 2014 due primarily to (1) the $750.0 million upfront payment received from Medtronic under a litigation settlement agreement, and (2) a higher bonus payout in 2015 associated with 2014 performance.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P72_S1	These decreases were partially offset by (1) income tax payments of $224.5 million made in 2014 related to the Medtronic settlement, (2) improved operating performance in 2015, and (3) the $50.0 million charitable contribution made in 2014 to the Edwards Lifesciences Foundation.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P73_S0	Net cash used in investing activities of $211.7 million in 2016 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $176.1 million and $41.3 million for the acquisition of intangible assets.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P74_S0	Net cash used in investing activities of $316.1 million in 2015 consisted primarily of a $320.1 million net payment associated with the acquisition of CardiAQ, and capital expenditures of $102.7 million , partially offset by net proceeds from investments of $119.6 million .
1099800_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	Net cash used in investing activities of $633.0 million in 2014 consisted primarily of net purchases of investments of $527.4 million and capital expenditures of $82.9 million.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	Net cash used in financing activities of $268.5 million in 2016 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of $662.3 million , partially offset by (1) net proceeds from the issuance of debt of $222.1 million , (2) proceeds from stock plans of $103.3 million , and (3) the excess tax benefit from stock plans of $64.3 million .
1099800_17_ITEM7_P77_S0	Net cash used in financing activities of $158.6 million in 2015 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of $280.1 million , partially offset by (1) proceeds from stock plans of $87.2 million , and (2) the excess tax benefit from stock plans of $41.3 million .
1099800_17_ITEM7_P78_S0	Net cash used in financing activities of $153.0 million in 2014 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of $300.9 million, partially offset by (1) proceeds from stock plans of $113.3 million, and (2) the excess tax benefit from stock plans of $49.4 million (including the realization of previously unrealized excess tax benefits).
1099800_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	A summary of all of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2016 were as follows (in millions):
1099800_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	The amount included in "Less Than 1 Year" reflects anticipated contributions to our various pension plans.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P80_S1	Anticipated contributions beyond one year are not determinable.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P80_S2	The total accrued benefit liability for our pension plans recognized as of December 31, 2016 was $50.1 million .
1099800_17_ITEM7_P80_S3	This amount is impacted by, among other items, pension expense funding levels, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and investment returns on plan assets.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P80_S4	Therefore, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid, and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P80_S5	See Note 12 to the " Consolidated Financial Statements " for further information.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	(b) Capital commitment obligations consist primarily of cash that we are obligated to pay to our limited partnership and limited liability corporation investees.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P81_S1	These investees make equity investments in various development stage biopharmaceutical and medical device companies, and it is not certain if and/or when these payments will be made.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	(c) As of December 31, 2016 , the gross liability for uncertain tax positions, including interest, was $271.0 million .
1099800_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	We have been pursuing an APA between the Switzerland and United States governments for the years 2009 through 2013 covering transfer pricing matters with the possibility of a roll-forward of the results to subsequent years.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P83_S1	These transfer pricing matters are significant to our consolidated financial statements, and the final outcome of the negotiations is uncertain.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P83_S2	Management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result for our uncertain tax positions.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P83_S3	We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid, and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	(d) We acquire assets still in development, enter into research and development arrangements, acquire businesses, and sponsor certain clinical trials that often require milestone, royalty, or other future payments to third-parties, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P84_S1	In situations where we have no ability to influence the achievement of the milestone or otherwise avoid the payment, we have included those payments in the table above.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P84_S2	However, we have excluded from the table contingent milestone payments and other contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payments or for which we can avoid making payment by unilaterally deciding to stop development of a product or cease progress of a clinical trial.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P84_S3	We estimate that these contingent payments could be up to approximately $510.0 million if all milestones or other contingent obligations were met.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P84_S4	Included in this amount is $350.0 million of contingent obligations related to our acquisition of Valtech, which may be paid through a combination of cash and issuance of common stock.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P84_S5	In addition, the Valtech acquisition closed in January 2017, and the consideration paid included the issuance of approximately 2.8 million shares of our common stock (fair value of $266.5 million) and cash of $84.3 million, which has not been included in the above table.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	Certain of our accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ("GAAP").
1099800_17_ITEM7_P85_S1	In evaluating our transactions, management assesses all relevant GAAP and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P86_S0	The application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P87_S0	Management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements, using historical experience and all available information.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P87_S1	We also use outside experts where appropriate.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P88_S0	We apply estimation methodologies consistently from year to year.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P89_S0	We believe the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P90_S0	When we recognize revenue from the sale of our products, we record an estimate of various sales returns and allowances which reduces product sales and accounts receivable.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P90_S1	These adjustments include estimates for rebates, returns, and other sales allowances.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P90_S2	These provisions are estimated based upon historical payment experience, historical relationship to revenues, estimated customer inventory levels, and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P90_S3	Product returns are not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P90_S4	If the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not approximate future activity, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be impacted.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P91_S0	In addition, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P91_S1	For these transactions, we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P91_S2	Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls, and variation in product utilization all affect the estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P92_S0	Our sales adjustment related to distributor rebates given to our United States distributors represents the difference between our sales price to the distributor (at our distributor "list price") and the negotiated price to be paid by the end-customer.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P92_S1	We validate the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from our distributors or an estimate of the distributor's inventory.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P92_S2	This distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P92_S3	We periodically monitor current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the credit for future distributor rebates is fairly stated.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P93_S0	The valuation of our inventory requires us to estimate excess, obsolete, and expired inventory.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P93_S1	We base our provisions for excess, obsolete, and expired inventory on our estimates of forecasted net sales.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P93_S2	A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional allowances for excess, obsolete, and expired inventory in the future.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P93_S3	In addition, our industry is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P93_S4	Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls, increasing levels of consigned inventory, and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess, obsolete, and expired inventory.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P94_S0	We acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations and asset purchases.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P94_S1	The acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value, which is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P94_S2	The determination of fair value requires significant estimates, including, but not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate used to discount those cash flows, the assessment of the asset's life cycle, including the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects, and the consideration of legal, technical, regulatory, economic, and competitive risks.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P95_S0	IPR D acquired in business combinations is reviewed for impairment annually, or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P95_S1	Additionally, management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and long-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P95_S2	The impairment reviews require significant estimates about fair value, including estimation of future cash flows, selection of an appropriate discount rate, and estimates of long-term growth rates.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P96_S0	We record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P96_S1	We determine the fair value of the contingent consideration based primarily on the following factors:
1099800_17_ITEM7_P97_S0	On a quarterly basis, we revalue these obligations and record changes in their fair value as an adjustment to earnings.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P97_S1	Changes to contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to discount rates, accretion of the discount rates due to the passage of time, changes in our estimates of the likelihood or timing of achieving development or commercial milestones, changes in the probability of certain clinical events, or changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P98_S0	The assumptions related to determining the value of contingent consideration include a significant amount of judgment, and any changes in the underlying estimates could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense recorded in any given period.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P99_S0	The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P99_S1	Realization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P99_S2	Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P100_S0	We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P100_S1	Our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P100_S2	These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income amongst various tax jurisdictions.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P100_S3	We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P100_S4	Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions, including estimating the ultimate resolution to intercompany pricing controversies between countries when there are numerous possible outcomes.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P100_S5	We review these tax uncertainties quarterly and adjust the liability as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as the progress of tax audits, lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues, and issuance of new legislation, regulations, or case law.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P101_S0	We measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards based on estimated fair values.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P102_S0	Stock-based awards consist of stock options, service-based restricted stock units, market-based restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units, and employee stock purchase subscriptions.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P102_S1	The fair value of each option award and employee stock purchase subscription is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P102_S2	The fair value of market-based restricted stock units is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which uses multiple input variables to determine the probability of satisfying the market condition requirements.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P102_S3	The Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo models require various highly judgmental assumptions, including stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected option term.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P102_S4	For performance-based restricted stock units, expense is recognized if and when we conclude that it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved, which requires judgment.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P103_S0	Stock-based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P103_S1	Judgment is required in estimating the stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited.
1099800_17_ITEM7_P103_S2	If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations would be impacted.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets, including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We manage these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Our investment strategy is focused on preserving capital and supporting our liquidity requirements, while earning a reasonable market return.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P1_S2	We invest in a variety of fixed-rate debt securities, primarily time deposits, commercial paper, U.S. government and agency securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, and municipal debt securities.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P1_S3	The market value of our investments may decline if current market interest rates rise.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P1_S4	As of December 31, 2016 , we had $839.2 million of investments in fixed-rate debt securities which had an average remaining term to maturity of approximately 1.1 years.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P1_S5	Taking into consideration the average maturity of our fixed-rate debt securities, a hypothetical 0.5% to 1.0% absolute increase in interest rates at December 31, 2016 would have resulted in a $4.8 million to $9.5 million decrease in the fair value of these investments.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P1_S6	Such a decrease would only result in a realized loss if we choose or are forced to sell the investments before the scheduled maturity, which we currently do not anticipate.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We are also exposed to interest rate risk on our debt obligations.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P2_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , we had $600.0 million of Notes outstanding that carry a fixed rate, and also had available a $750.0 million Credit Agreement that carries a variable interest rate based on the London interbank offered rate ("LIBOR").
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P2_S2	As of December 31, 2016 , borrowings of $225.0 million were outstanding under the Credit Agreement.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	To diversify our interest rate risk, we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300.0 million.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The critical terms of the swaps match the critical terms of $300.0 million of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, effectively converting that portion of the fixed-rate issue to a floating variable rate based on a 6-month LIBOR benchmark.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Based on our year end 2016 variable debt levels, a hypothetical 1.0% absolute increase in our floating market interest rates would increase our interest expense by approximately $5.3 million, most of which would be offset by increased returns on our short-term investments.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The impact on net interest would be immaterial to our financial condition and results of operations.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P5_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , a hypothetical 1.0% absolute increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of the fixed-rate debt by approximately $10.4 million.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P5_S1	This hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixed-rate debt.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P6_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P6_S1	These risks include the translation of local currency balances and results of our non-United States subsidiaries into United States dollars, currency gains and losses related to intercompany and third-party transactions denominated in currencies other than a location's functional currency, and currency gains and losses associated with intercompany loans.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P6_S2	Our principal currency exposures relate to the Euro and the Japanese yen.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P6_S3	Our objective is to minimize the volatility of our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and the use of derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options contracts.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P6_S4	The total notional amount of our derivative financial instruments entered into for foreign currency management purposes at December 31, 2016 was $949.7 million .
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P6_S5	A hypothetical 10% increase/decrease in the value of the United States dollar against all hedged currencies would increase/decrease the fair value of these derivative contracts by $66.0 million.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P6_S6	Any gains or losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions, so the net impact would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Derivative financial instruments involve credit risk in the event the financial institution counterparty should default.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P7_S1	It is our policy to execute such instruments with major financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P7_S2	At December 31, 2016 , all derivative financial instruments were with bank counterparties assigned investment grade ratings by national rating agencies.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P8_S0	We have not experienced a counterparty default and do not anticipate any non-performance by our current derivative counterparties.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P9_S0	We invest excess cash in a variety of fixed-rate debt securities, and diversify the investments between financial institutions.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P9_S1	Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P10_S0	In the normal course of business, we provide credit to customers in the health care industry, perform credit evaluations of these customers, and maintain allowances for potential credit losses, which have historically been adequate compared to actual losses.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P10_S1	In 2016 , we had no customers that represented 10% or more of our total net sales or accounts receivable, net.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P11_S0	We are exposed to investment risks related to changes in the underlying financial condition and credit capacity of certain of our investments.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P11_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , we had $839.2 million of investments in fixed-rate debt securities of various companies, of which $498.2 million were long-term.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P11_S2	In addition, we had $33.9 million of investments in equity instruments of public and private companies.
1099800_17_ITEM7A_P11_S3	Should these companies experience a decline in financial condition or credit capacity, or fail to meet certain development milestones, a decline in the investments' values may occur, resulting in unrealized or realized losses.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	For the Years Ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014:
1099800_17_ITEM8_P1_S0	Other schedules are not applicable and have not been submitted.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P2_S0	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Edwards Lifesciences Corporation:
1099800_17_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Edwards Lifesciences Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P3_S1	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1099800_17_ITEM8_P3_S2	The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting under Item 9A.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P3_S3	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P3_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1099800_17_ITEM8_P3_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P3_S6	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P3_S7	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P3_S8	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P3_S9	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P4_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P4_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P5_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P5_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1099800_17_ITEM8_P11_S2	The products and technologies provided by Edwards Lifesciences are categorized into the following main areas:
1099800_17_ITEM8_P11_S3	Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy, Surgical Heart Valve Therapy, and Critical Care.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P12_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Edwards Lifesciences and its majority-owned subsidiaries.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P12_S1	All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P13_S0	The Company reviews its investments in other entities to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity ("VIE").
1099800_17_ITEM8_P13_S1	The Company would be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, and would be required to consolidate the VIE, if it has the power to direct the significant activities of the entity and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entity that may be significant to the VIE.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P13_S2	Based on the Company's analysis, it determined it is not the primary beneficiary of any VIEs; however, future events may require VIEs to be consolidated if the Company becomes the primary beneficiary.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P14_S0	The consolidated financial statements of Edwards Lifesciences have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") which have been applied consistently in all material respects.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P14_S1	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P14_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P15_S0	When the local currency of the Company's foreign entities is the functional currency, all assets and liabilities are translated into United States dollars at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date.

1099800_17_ITEM8_P16_S0	The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P17_S0	Revenue is considered realized or realizable and earned upon delivery of the product, provided that an agreement of sale exists, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P17_S1	In the case of certain products where the Company maintains consigned inventory at customer locations, revenue is recognized at the time the customer has used the inventory.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P18_S0	The Company's principal sales terms provide for title and risk of loss transferring upon delivery to the customer, limited right of return, and no unusual provisions or conditions.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P18_S1	When the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products, an estimate of various sales returns and allowances is recorded which reduces product sales and accounts receivable.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P18_S2	These adjustments include estimates for rebates, returns, and other sales allowances.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P18_S3	These provisions are estimated and recorded at the time of sale based upon historical payment experience, historical relationship to revenues, estimated customer inventory levels, and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P18_S4	Other than in limited circumstances, product returns are not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P18_S5	In addition, the Company may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P18_S6	For these transactions, the Company defers recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount of product to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer.

1099800_17_ITEM8_P20_S0	The Company's sales adjustment related to distributor rebates given to the Company's United States distributors represents the difference between the Company's sales price to the distributor (at the Company's distributor "list price") and the negotiated price to be paid by the end-customer.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P20_S1	This distributor rebate is recorded by the Company as a reduction to sales and a reduction to the distributor's accounts receivable at the time of sale to a distributor.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P20_S2	The Company validates the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from its distributors or an estimate of its distributor's inventory.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P20_S3	This distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P20_S4	The Company periodically monitors current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the credit for future distributor rebates is fairly stated.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P21_S0	The Company also offers volume rebates to certain group purchasing organizations ("GPOs") and customers based upon target sales levels.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P21_S1	For volume rebates offered to GPOs, the rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and an obligation to the GPOs, as the Company expects to pay in cash.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P21_S2	For volume rebates offered to customers, the rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and accounts receivable, as the Company expects a net payment from the customer.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P21_S3	The provision for volume rebates is estimated based on customers' contracted rebate programs and historical experience of rebates paid.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P21_S4	The Company periodically monitors its customer rebate programs to ensure that the allowance and liability for accrued rebates is fairly stated.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P22_S0	The Company considers highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P22_S1	These investments are valued at cost, which approximates fair value.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P23_S0	The Company invests its excess cash in fixed-rate debt securities, including time deposits, commercial paper, U.S. government and agency securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, and municipal debt securities.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P23_S1	Investments with maturities of one year or less are classified as short-term, and investments with maturities greater than one year are classified as long-term.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P23_S2	Investments that the Company has the ability and intent to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P23_S3	The Company determines the appropriate classification of its investments in fixed-rate debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation at each balance sheet date.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P24_S0	The Company also has long-term equity investments in companies that are in various stages of development.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P24_S1	These investments are designated as available-for-sale.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P24_S2	Other investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for under the cost or the equity method of accounting, as appropriate.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P25_S0	The Company accounts for investments in limited partnerships or limited liability corporations, whereby the Company owns a minimum of 5% of the investee's outstanding voting stock, under the equity method of accounting.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P25_S1	These investments are recorded at the amount of the Company's investment and adjusted each period for the Company's share of the investee's income or loss, and dividends paid.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P25_S2	As investments accounted for under the cost method do not have readily determinable fair values, the Company only estimates fair value if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that could have a significant adverse effect on the investment's fair value.

1099800_17_ITEM8_P27_S0	The Company periodically reviews its investments for impairment.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P27_S1	When the fair value of an investment declines below cost, management uses the following criteria to determine if such a decline should be considered other-than-temporary and result in a recognized loss:

1099800_17_ITEM8_P29_S0	The Company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer-specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P29_S1	When evaluating its allowances for doubtful accounts related to receivables from customers in certain European countries that have historically paid beyond the stated terms, the Company's analysis considers a number of factors including evidence of the customer's ability to comply with credit terms, economic conditions, and procedures implemented by the Company to collect the historical receivables.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P29_S2	Additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances, if economic conditions are less favorable than the Company has anticipated, or for customer-specific circumstances, such as financial difficulty.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P29_S3	The allowance for doubtful accounts related to both short-term and long-term receivables was $12.8 million and $13.1 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P30_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market value.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P30_S1	Market value for raw materials is based on replacement costs, and for other inventory classifications is based on net realizable value.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P31_S0	A write-down for excess or slow moving inventory is recorded for inventory which is obsolete, nearing its expiration date (generally triggered at six months prior to expiration), is damaged, or slow moving (generally defined as quantities in excess of a two -year supply).
1099800_17_ITEM8_P31_S1	The allowance for excess and slow moving inventory was $29.1 million and $30.1 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.

1099800_17_ITEM8_P34_S0	Property, plant, and equipment are recorded at cost.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P34_S1	Depreciation is principally calculated for financial reporting purposes on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from 10 to 40 years for buildings and improvements, from 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment, and from 3 to 7 years for software.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P34_S2	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the related facility leases or the asset, whichever is shorter.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P34_S3	Straight-line and accelerated methods of depreciation are used for income tax purposes.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P35_S0	EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P36_S0	Depreciation expense for property, plant, and equipment was $63.6 million , $58.7 million , and $57.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P37_S0	Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P38_S0	The Company identifies its reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities, including existing goodwill, to those reporting units.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P38_S1	The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based on the Company's market capitalization and a market revenue multiple.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P38_S2	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, then the Company measures the amount of the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P38_S3	In 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , the Company did not record any impairment loss as the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its respective carrying value.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P39_S0	Indefinite-lived intangible assets relate to in-process research and development ("IPR D") acquired in business combinations.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P39_S1	The estimated fair values of IPR D projects acquired in a business combination which have not reached technological feasibility are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P39_S2	Upon successful completion of the project, the capitalized amount is amortized over its estimated useful life.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P39_S3	If the project is abandoned, all remaining capitalized amounts are written off immediately.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P40_S0	Indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually, or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P40_S1	An impairment loss is recognized when the asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P41_S0	IPR D projects acquired in an asset acquisition are expensed unless the project has an alternative future use.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P41_S1	In 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , the Company did not record any impairment loss related to its IPR D assets.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P42_S0	Management reviews the carrying amounts of other finite-lived intangible assets and long-lived tangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P42_S1	Impairment indicators include, among other conditions, cash flow deficits, historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit, and adverse legal or regulatory developments.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P42_S2	If it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable, based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization periods, their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P43_S0	Estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P43_S1	For the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment, long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P44_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P44_S1	The Company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and adjusting the amount, if necessary.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P44_S2	The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are both historical experience and the Company's forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P44_S3	Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the Company's effective tax rate on future earnings.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P45_S0	When assessing whether a windfall tax benefit relating to stock-based compensation has been realized, the Company follows the with and without approach, under which the windfall benefit is recognized only if an incremental benefit is provided after considering all other tax attributes presently available to the Company.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P45_S1	Consideration is given only to the direct impact of stock awards when calculating the amount of windfalls and shortfalls.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P46_S0	The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P46_S1	Significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company's uncertain tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes.

1099800_17_ITEM8_P48_S0	For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the relevant tax authority.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P49_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P50_S0	Research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P51_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average common shares outstanding during a period.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P51_S1	Employee equity share options, nonvested shares, and similar equity instruments granted by the Company are treated as potential common shares in computing diluted earnings per share.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P51_S2	Diluted shares outstanding include the dilutive effect of restricted stock units and in-the-money options.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P52_S0	The dilutive impact of the restricted stock units and in-the-money options is calculated based on the average share price for each fiscal period using the treasury stock method.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P52_S1	Under the treasury stock method, the amount that the employee must pay for exercising stock options, the amount of compensation expense for future service that the Company has not yet recognized, and the amount of tax benefits that would be recorded in " Additional Paid-in Capital " when the award becomes deductible are assumed to be used to repurchase shares.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P52_S2	Potential common share equivalents have been excluded where their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P53_S0	The table below presents the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (in millions, except for per share information):
1099800_17_ITEM8_P54_S0	Stock options and restricted stock units to purchase approximately 0.9 million , 1.4 million , and 4.8 million shares for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively, were outstanding, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P55_S0	The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based awards based on estimated fair values.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P56_S0	Stock-based awards consist of stock options, restricted stock units (service-based, market-based, and performance-based), and employee stock purchase subscriptions.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P56_S1	Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period (vesting period) on a straight-line basis.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P56_S2	For performance-based restricted stock units, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense if and when the Company concludes that it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved, net of estimated forfeitures.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P56_S3	The Company reassesses the probability of vesting at each quarter end and adjusts the stock-based compensation expense based on its probability assessment.

1099800_17_ITEM8_P59_S0	Upon exercise of stock options or vesting of restricted stock units, the Company issues common stock.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P60_S0	Total stock-based compensation expense was as follows (in millions):
1099800_17_ITEM8_P61_S0	Upon retirement, all unvested stock options and performance-based restricted stock units are immediately forfeited.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P61_S1	In addition, upon retirement, a participant will immediately vest in 25% of service-based restricted stock units for each full year of employment with the Company measured from the grant date.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P61_S2	All remaining unvested service-based restricted stock units are immediately forfeited.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P62_S0	For market-based restricted stock units, upon retirement and in certain other specified cases, a participant will receive a pro-rated portion of the shares that would ultimately be issued based on attainment of the performance goals as determined on the vesting date.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P62_S1	The pro-rated portion is based on the participant's whole months of service with the Company during the performance period prior to the date of termination.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P63_S0	The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate and foreign currency risks.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P63_S1	It is the Company's policy not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P64_S0	The Company uses interest rate swaps to convert a portion of its fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P64_S1	These interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges and meet the shortcut method requirements under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P64_S2	Accordingly, changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P64_S3	The Company uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the changes due to currency rate movements in the amount of future cash flows associated with intercompany transactions and certain local currency expenses expected to occur within the next 13 months .
1099800_17_ITEM8_P64_S4	These foreign currency forward exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedges.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P65_S0	Certain of the Company's locations have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies resulting principally from intercompany and local currency transactions.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P65_S1	The Company uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to offset the transaction gains and losses associated with certain of these assets and liabilities.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P65_S2	The Company also uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect its net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P65_S3	These foreign currency forward exchange contracts are designated as net investment hedges.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P66_S0	All foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency option contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries, principally the Euro and the Japanese yen.

1099800_17_ITEM8_P67_S1	For each derivative instrument that is designated and effective as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized immediately to earnings, and offsets the loss or gain on the underlying hedged item.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P67_S2	The gain or loss on fair value hedges is classified in net interest expense, as they hedge the interest rate risk associated with the Company's fixed-rate debt.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P68_S0	The Company reports in " Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss " the effective portion of the gain or loss on derivative financial instruments that are designated, and that qualify, as cash flow hedges.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P68_S1	The Company reclassifies these gains and losses into earnings in the same period in which the underlying hedged transactions affect earnings.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P68_S2	The effective portions of net investment hedges are reported in " Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss " as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment, and would be reclassified into earnings if the underlying net investment is sold or substantially liquidated.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P68_S3	The ineffective portions of cash flow hedges and net investment hedges are recorded in current period earnings.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P68_S4	During 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , the Company did not record any gains or losses due to hedge ineffectiveness.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P68_S5	The gains and losses on derivative financial instruments for which the Company does not elect hedge accounting treatment are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in each period based upon the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument.

1099800_17_ITEM8_P72_S0	In September 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an update to the guidance on business combinations.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P72_S1	The new guidance requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P72_S2	The guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P72_S3	The adoption of this guidance did not impact the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P73_S0	In April 2015, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting guidance on the presentation of debt issuance costs.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P73_S1	The guidance requires an entity to present debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt, consistent with debt discounts.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P73_S2	In August 2015, the FASB clarified that for a line-of-credit arrangement, a company can continue to defer and present debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortize the debt issuance costs over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, whether or not there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P73_S3	The guidance was effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2015 and interim periods within those periods, and must be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P73_S4	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P74_S0	In January 2017, the FASB issued an amendment to the guidance on intangible assets.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P74_S1	The amendment simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P75_S0	Step 2 measures a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P75_S1	Instead, under this amendment, an entity performs its goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P75_S2	The guidance is effective for annual or interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P75_S3	Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P75_S4	The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance will impact its consolidated financial statements.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P76_S0	In January 2017, the FASB issued an amendment to the guidance on business combinations.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P76_S1	The amendment clarifies the definition of a business and provides a screen to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities is not a business.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P76_S2	The screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P76_S3	The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P77_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued an amendment to the guidance on the statement of cash flows.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P77_S1	The standard addresses eight specific cash flow issues, and is intended to reduce the diversity in practice around how certain transactions are classified within the statement of cash flows.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P77_S2	The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P77_S3	This guidance will impact how the Company classifies contingent consideration payments made after a business combination.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P77_S4	Contingent consideration payments that are not made soon after the acquisition date will be classified as a financing activity up to the amount of the contingent consideration liability recognized at the acquisition date, with any excess classified as an operating activity.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P77_S5	The Company does not expect the adoption of the other provisions of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

1099800_17_ITEM8_P79_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued an amendment to the guidance on stock compensation.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P79_S1	The amendment simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P79_S2	The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P79_S3	The Company anticipates that adoption of this guidance will introduce more volatility to its effective tax rate, generally reducing the rate.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P80_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued an amendment to the guidance on leases.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P80_S1	The amendment improves transparency and comparability among companies by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and by disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P80_S2	The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P80_S3	The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P81_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued an update to the accounting guidance on revenue recognition.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P81_S1	The new guidance provides a comprehensive, principles-based approach to revenue recognition, and supersedes most previous revenue recognition guidance.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P82_S0	The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P82_S1	The guidance also requires improved disclosures on the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P82_S2	In August 2015, the FASB issued an update to the guidance to defer the effective date by one year, such that the new standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods therein.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P82_S3	The new guidance can be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented, or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of the change recognized at the date of the initial application.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P82_S4	The Company is assessing all of the potential impacts of the revenue recognition guidance and has not yet selected an adoption method.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P82_S5	The Company will adopt the new guidance effective January 1, 2018.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P83_S0	Although the Company has not yet completed its assessment of the new revenue recognition guidance, the Company's analysis of contracts related to the sale of its heart valve therapy products under the new revenue recognition guidance supports the recognition of revenue at a point-in-time, which is consistent with its current revenue recognition model.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P83_S1	Heart valve therapy sales accounted for approximately 80% of the Company's sales for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P83_S2	The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of the guidance on contracts related to the sale of its critical care products, specifically sales outside of the United States.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P84_S0	In May 2014, the Company entered into an agreement with Medtronic, Inc. and its affiliates ("Medtronic") to settle all outstanding patent litigation between the companies, including all cases related to transcatheter heart valves.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P84_S1	Pursuant to the agreement, all pending cases or appeals in courts and patent offices worldwide have been dismissed, and the parties will not litigate patent disputes with each other in the field of transcatheter valves for the eight -year term of the agreement.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P84_S2	Under the terms of a patent cross-license that is part of the agreement, Medtronic made a one-time, upfront payment to the Company for past damages in the amount of $750.0 million .
1099800_17_ITEM8_P84_S3	In addition, Medtronic will pay the Company quarterly license royalty payments through April 2022.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P84_S4	For sales in the United States, subject to certain conditions, the royalty payments will be based on a percentage of Medtronic's sales of transcatheter aortic valves, with a minimum annual payment of $40.0 million and a maximum annual payment of $60.0 million .
1099800_17_ITEM8_P84_S5	A separate royalty payment will be calculated based on sales of Medtronic transcatheter aortic valves manufactured in the United States but sold elsewhere.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P85_S0	The Company accounted for the settlement agreement as a multiple-element arrangement and allocated the total consideration to the identifiable elements based upon their relative fair value.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P85_S1	The consideration assigned to each element was as follows (in millions):
1099800_17_ITEM8_P86_S0	EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 3.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P87_S0	The Company recognized the upfront payment of $750.0 million in " Intellectual Property Litigation Expenses (Income), net " during the second quarter of 2014.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P87_S1	The accounting guidance limits the amount to be recognized upfront to the amount of cash received.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P87_S2	The remaining fair value associated with the past damages element, as well as the license agreement and the covenant not to sue, will be recognized in " Net Sales " over the term of the license agreement as delivery occurs since the Company considers the future royalties to be part of its revenue-earning activities that constitute its ongoing major or central operations.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P88_S0	The Company incurred external legal costs related to intellectual property litigation of $32.6 million , $7.0 million , and $9.6 million during 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P88_S1	The increase in intellectual property litigation expenses in 2016 was primarily due to the resolution of an intellectual property litigation matter, and the increased costs associated with ongoing litigation in the United States and Europe.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P89_S0	In May 2016, the Company entered into two separate agreements to acquire technologies for use in its transcatheter heart valve programs.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P89_S1	In connection with these agreements, the Company recorded an IPR D charge totaling $34.5 million .
1099800_17_ITEM8_P89_S2	The acquired technologies are in the early stages of development and have no alternative uses.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P89_S3	Additional design developments, bench testing, pre-clinical studies, and human clinical studies must be successfully completed prior to selling any product using these technologies.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P90_S0	In December 2014, the Company acquired technology for use in its transcatheter mitral valve program.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P90_S1	In connection with this acquisition, the Company recorded a $10.2 million IPR D charge, including related expenses.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P90_S2	The acquired technology has no alternative uses.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P90_S3	Additional design developments, bench testing, pre-clinical studies, and human clinical studies must be successfully completed prior to selling any product.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P90_S4	Under the terms of the purchase agreement, the Company must pay an additional $10.0 million if, within 9 years of the acquisition closing date, the Company receives CE Mark for a transcatheter mitral valve repair or replacement product that incorporates the acquired technology.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P91_S0	In June 2014, the Company contributed $50.0 million to the Edwards Lifesciences Foundation, a related-party not-for-profit organization intended to provide philanthropic support to health- and community-focused charitable organizations.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P91_S1	The contribution was irrevocable and was recorded as an expense at the time of payment.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P92_S0	In March 2014, the Company recorded a $7.5 million charge to settle past and future obligations related to one of its intellectual property agreements.

1099800_17_ITEM8_P94_S0	In September 2014, due to a strategic shift of the Company's investment initiatives, the Company decided to refocus resources from its automated glucose monitoring program.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P94_S1	As a result, the Company recorded a charge of $3.0 million to write down an intangible asset and fixed assets, and to record severance costs.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P94_S2	In addition, the Company recorded a $2.0 million charge to " Cost of Sales ," primarily related to the disposal of inventory and equipment held by customers.

1099800_17_ITEM8_P100_S0	The Company has a number of equity investments in privately and publicly held companies.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P100_S1	Investments in these unconsolidated affiliates are recorded in " Long-term Investments " on the consolidated balance sheets, and are as follows:
1099800_17_ITEM8_P101_S0	In December 2015, the Company made a $1.5 million investment in Harpoon Medical, Inc. ("Harpoon Medical").
1099800_17_ITEM8_P101_S1	As part of the agreement, the Company also paid $11.5 million , included in " Other Assets ," for an exclusive option to acquire Harpoon Medical for up to $250.0 million , depending upon the achievement of certain milestones and regulatory approvals.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P102_S0	Harpoon Medical is developing a surgical device for minimally invasive mitral valve repair and the treatment of mitral valve regurgitation that is currently in the clinical testing phase, and is financed primarily through equity investments.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P103_S0	In December 2014, the Company made a $10.0 million investment in one of its existing cost method investees, CardioKinetix, Inc. ("CardioKinetix"), for a total investment carrying value of $14.4 million .
1099800_17_ITEM8_P103_S1	As part of the agreement, the Company also paid $15.0 million , included in " Other Assets, " for an exclusive option to acquire CardioKinetix for up to $375.0 million , depending upon the achievement of certain milestones and regulatory approvals.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P104_S0	CardioKinetix is pioneering a catheter-based treatment for heart failure that is currently in the clinical testing phase, and is financed primarily through equity investments.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P105_S0	Harpoon Medical and CardioKinetix are VIEs; however, the Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs since the Company does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact their economic performance.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P105_S1	The Company made this determination based on the development stage of the VIEs' products; the Company's inability to exercise influence over the VIEs, based on the Company's ownership percentage and voting rights, as well as its lack of involvement in day-to-day operations and management decisions; and the fact that the option to acquire each of the VIEs is currently significantly out of the money.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P105_S2	Accordingly, the Company accounts for these investments as cost method investments.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P105_S3	The Company's maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with CardioKinetix and Harpoon Medical is limited to the carrying amount of its investment and the cost of the option to acquire each of these entities.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P106_S0	During 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , the gross realized gains or losses from sales of available-for-sale investments were not material.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P107_S0	On November 26, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger to acquire Valtech Cardio Ltd. ("Valtech") for approximately $340.0 million , subject to certain adjustments, with the potential for up to an additional $350.0 million in pre-specified milestone-driven payments over the next 10 years.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P107_S1	The transaction closed on January 23, 2017, and the consideration paid included the issuance of approximately 2.8 million shares of the Company's common stock (fair value of $266.5 million ) and cash of $84.3 million .
1099800_17_ITEM8_P107_S2	Acquisition-related costs of $4.1 million were recorded in Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P107_S3	Prior to the close of the transaction, Valtech spun off its early-stage transseptal mitral valve replacement technology program.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P107_S4	Concurrent with the closing, the Company entered into an agreement for an exclusive option to acquire that program and its associated intellectual property for approximately $200.0 million , subject to certain adjustments.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P107_S5	The option expires 2 years after the closing date of the transaction, but can be extended by up to a year depending on the results of certain clinical trials.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P107_S6	The initial purchase accounting for this transaction has not yet been completed given the short period of time between the acquisition date and the issuance of these financial statements.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P108_S0	Valtech is a developer of a transcatheter mitral and tricuspid valve repair system.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P108_S1	The Company plans to add this technology to its portfolio of mitral and tricuspid repair products.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P108_S2	The acquisition will be accounted for as a business combination, and is expected to consist primarily of goodwill, developed technology, and in-process research and development.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P108_S3	The Company is in the process of evaluating the potential impact of the business combination on its consolidated financial statements.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P109_S0	On July 3, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger to acquire CardiAQ Valve Technologies, Inc. ("CardiAQ") for an aggregate cash purchase price of $350.0 million , subject to certain adjustments.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P109_S1	The transaction closed on August 26, 2015, and the cash purchase price after the adjustments was $348.0 million .
1099800_17_ITEM8_P109_S2	In addition, the Company agreed to pay an additional $50.0 million if a certain European regulatory approval is obtained within 48 months of the acquisition closing date.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P109_S3	The Company recognized in " Other Long-term Liabilities " a $30.3 million liability for the estimated fair value of this contingent milestone payment.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P109_S4	The fair value of the contingent milestone payment will be remeasured each quarter, with changes in the fair value recognized within operating expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P109_S5	For further information on the fair value of the contingent milestone payment, see Note 10.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P110_S0	In connection with the acquisition, the Company placed $30.0 million of the purchase price into escrow to satisfy any claims for indemnification made in accordance with the merger agreement.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P110_S1	Pending resolution of an outstanding claim under the agreement and plan of merger, any remaining funds will be disbursed to CardiAQ s former shareholders.

1099800_17_ITEM8_P112_S2	The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P112_S3	Tangible and intangible assets acquired were recorded based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P112_S4	The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired was recorded to goodwill.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P112_S5	The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed (in millions):
1099800_17_ITEM8_P113_S0	Goodwill includes expected synergies and other benefits the Company believes will result from the acquisition.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P113_S1	Goodwill was assigned to the Company s United States segment and is not deductible for tax purposes.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P113_S2	IPR D has been capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and will be assessed for impairment in subsequent periods.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P114_S0	The fair value of the IPR D was determined using the income approach.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P114_S1	This approach determines fair value based on cash flow projections which are discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted rate of return.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P114_S2	The discount rate used to determine the fair value of the IPR D was 16.5% .
1099800_17_ITEM8_P115_S0	Completion of successful design developments, bench testing, pre-clinical studies and human clinical studies are required prior to selling any product.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P115_S1	The risks and uncertainties associated with completing development within a reasonable period of time include those related to the design, development, and manufacturability of the product, the success of pre-clinical and clinical studies, and the timing of regulatory approvals.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P115_S2	The valuation assumed $97.7 million of additional research and development expenditures would be incurred prior to the date of product introduction, and the Company does not currently anticipate significant changes to forecasted research and development expenditures associated with the CardiAQ program.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P115_S3	The Company's valuation model also assumed net cash inflows would commence in late 2018, if successful clinical trial experiences lead to a CE mark approval.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P116_S0	Upon completion of development, the underlying research and development intangible asset will be amortized over its estimated useful life.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P116_S1	The Company disclosed in early February 2017 that it had voluntarily paused enrollment in its clinical trials for the Edwards-CardiAQ valve to perform further design validation testing on a feature of the valve.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P116_S2	This testing has been completed and, in collaboration with clinical investigators, the Company has decided to resume screening patients for enrollment in its clinical trials.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P117_S0	The results of operations for CardiAQ have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P117_S1	Pro forma results have not been presented as the results of CardiAQ are not material in relation to the consolidated financial statements of the Company.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P118_S0	On July 3, 2015, the Company acquired CardiAQ (see Note 7).
1099800_17_ITEM8_P118_S1	This transaction resulted in an increase to goodwill of $258.9 million and IPR D of $190.0 million .

1099800_17_ITEM8_P121_S0	Goodwill and IPR D resulting from purchase business combinations are not subject to amortization.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P121_S1	Other acquired intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P122_S0	The Company expenses costs incurred to renew or extend the term of acquired intangible assets.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P123_S0	Amortization expense related to other intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 was $7.6 million , $7.1 million , and $8.4 million , respectively.

1099800_17_ITEM8_P215_S0	During 2016 , net deferred tax assets increased $24.2 million , including items that were recorded to stockholders' equity and which did not impact the Company's income tax provision.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P216_S0	The valuation allowance of $47.7 million as of December 31, 2016 reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P216_S1	This allowance primarily relates to the net operating loss carryforwards of certain United States and non-United States subsidiaries, and to the deferred tax assets established for impairment losses on certain investments and for certain non-United States credit carryforwards.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P217_S0	A valuation allowance of $2.6 million has been provided for other-than-temporary impairments and unrealized losses related to certain investments that may not be recognized due to the uncertainty of the ready marketability of certain impaired investments.

1099800_17_ITEM8_P221_S0	The Company has $76.6 million of California research expenditure tax credits it expects to use in future periods.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P221_S1	The credits may be carried forward indefinitely.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P221_S2	Based upon anticipated future taxable income, the Company expects that it is more likely than not that all California research expenditure tax credits will be utilized, although the utilization of the full benefit is expected to occur over a number of years and into the distant future.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P221_S3	Accordingly, no valuation allowance has been provided.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P222_S0	The United States state net operating loss carryforwards include $6.0 million of losses attributable to windfall stock option deductions.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P222_S1	A net benefit of $0.3 million will be recorded to " Additional Paid-in Capital " when realized as a reduction to income taxes payable.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P223_S0	Approximately $9.0 million of the California research expenditure tax credit carryforwards are attributable to windfall stock option deductions and will be recorded as a benefit to " Additional Paid-in Capital " when realized as a reduction to income taxes payable.

1099800_17_ITEM8_P224_S1	It is not practicable to calculate the deferred taxes associated with these earnings because of the variability of multiple factors that would need to be assessed at the time of any assumed repatriation; however, foreign tax credits would likely be available to reduce federal income taxes in the event of distribution.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P224_S2	In making this assertion, the Company evaluates, among other factors, the profitability of its United States and foreign operations and the need for cash within and outside the United States, including cash requirements for capital improvement, acquisitions, market expansion, and stock repurchase programs.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P224_S3	The Company does not expect any earnings for certain of its other foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and records the tax impact in net income currently.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P225_S0	The Company has received tax incentives in certain non-U.S. tax jurisdictions, the primary benefit of which will expire in 2024.

1099800_17_ITEM8_P227_S0	A reconciliation of the United States federal statutory income tax rate to the Company's effective income tax rate is as follows (in millions):
1099800_17_ITEM8_P228_S0	The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 was higher than the rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily because of fluctuations in the relative contribution of the Company's foreign operations and United States operations to worldwide pre-tax income, offset by an increase in benefits from the federal and California research credits.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P229_S0	The effective income tax rate for December 31, 2014 included (1) $262.1 million of tax expense associated with a $750.0 million litigation settlement payment received in May 2014 (see Note 3) and (2) $4.8 million of tax benefits from the remeasurement of uncertain tax positions.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P230_S0	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the gross uncertain tax positions were $245.5 million and $216.1 million , respectively.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P230_S1	The Company estimates that these liabilities would be reduced by $44.9 million and $40.6 million , respectively, from offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes, and timing adjustments.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P230_S2	The net amounts of $200.6 million and $175.5 million , respectively, if not required, would favorably affect the Company's effective tax rate.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P231_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of uncertain tax positions, excluding interest, penalties, and foreign exchange, is as follows (in millions):
1099800_17_ITEM8_P232_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P232_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , the Company had accrued $14.7 million (net of $10.8 million tax benefit) of interest related to uncertain tax positions, and as of December 31, 2015 , the Company had accrued $10.7 million (net of $7.6 million tax benefit) of interest related to uncertain tax positions.

1099800_17_ITEM8_P235_S0	The Company strives to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P235_S1	While the Company has accrued for matters it believes are more likely than not to require settlement, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P235_S2	Furthermore, the Company may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise its right to appeal.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P235_S3	The uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues, and issuance of new legislation, regulations, or case law.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P235_S4	Management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from these uncertain tax positions.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P236_S0	At December 31, 2016 , all material state, local, and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2008.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P237_S0	The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has substantially completed its fieldwork for the 2009 through 2012 tax years.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P237_S1	However, the audits are currently in suspense pending a final determination with respect to a pending application for an Advance Pricing Agreement ("APA").
1099800_17_ITEM8_P238_S0	The IRS began its examination of the 2014 tax year during the fourth quarter of 2016.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P239_S0	The Company has been pursuing an APA between the Switzerland and United States governments for the years 2009 through 2013 covering transfer pricing matters with the possibility of a roll-forward of the results to subsequent years.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P239_S1	These discussions remain ongoing as of December 31, 2016.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P239_S2	These transfer pricing matters are significant to the Company's consolidated financial statements as the disputed amounts are material, and the final outcome is uncertain.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P239_S3	The Company continues to believe its positions are supportable.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P240_S0	During 2014, the Company filed with the IRS a request for a pre-filing agreement associated with a tax return filing position on a portion of the litigation settlement payment received in May 2014 (see Note 3).
1099800_17_ITEM8_P240_S1	During the first quarter of 2015, the IRS accepted the Company's request into the pre-filing agreement program.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P240_S2	The closing agreement for this matter was finalized during the fourth quarter of 2016.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P240_S3	There remains a disputed issue and the Company expects to enter the Fast-Track Appeals process during 2017.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P240_S4	The Company made an advance payment of tax in December 2015 to prevent the further accrual of interest on any potential deficiency only and not to signify any potential agreement to a contrary position that may be taken by the IRS.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P241_S0	The Company believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from its uncertain tax positions.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P241_S1	Based upon the information currently available and numerous possible outcomes, the Company cannot reasonably estimate what, if any, changes in its existing uncertain tax positions may occur in the next 12 months and thus have recorded the gross uncertain tax positions as a long-term liability.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P241_S2	However, if the APA and/or the appeals process related to the pre-filing agreement is finalized in the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that these events could result in a significant change in the Company's uncertain tax positions within the next 12 months.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P242_S0	On October 30, 2015, Boston Scientific Scimed, Inc., a subsidiary of Boston Scientific Corporation ("Boston Scientific"), filed a lawsuit in the district court in D sseldorf, Germany against Edwards Lifesciences and its German subsidiary, Edwards Lifesciences Services GmbH, alleging that Edwards Lifesciences SAPIEN 3 heart valve infringes certain claims of a Boston Scientific German national patent arising from EP 2 749 254 B1 (the "'254 patent") related to paravalvular sealing technology.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P242_S1	On February 26, 2016, Boston Scientific added the German national patent arising from EP 2 926 766 (the "'766 Patent") to the infringement allegations.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P242_S2	On April 8, 2016, Boston Scientific filed a similar patent infringement action in district court in Paris, France relating to these patents.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P242_S3	The complaints seek unspecified money damages and injunctive relief.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P242_S4	The Company intends to defend itself vigorously in these matters.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P242_S5	Trial in the German matter was held in February 2017 and the German district court's decision is expected in the first quarter of 2017.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P242_S6	The French suit has been stayed pending the outcome of validity proceedings on the '766 and '254 patents.

1099800_17_ITEM8_P244_S1	Edwards Lifesciences later added Boston Scientific s UK national patent corresponding to the '766 patent to this invalidity lawsuit.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P245_S0	The Boston Scientific subsidiaries filed counterclaims against Edwards Lifesciences and three of its European subsidiaries alleging that the SAPIEN 3 heart valve infringes certain claims of the same patents and seeking unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P245_S1	Trial on the U.K. matter was held in January 2017 and a decision is expected in the first half of 2017.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P246_S0	On November 23, 2015, Edwards Lifesciences PVT, Inc., a U.S. subsidiary of Edwards Lifesciences, filed a lawsuit in the district court in D sseldorf, Germany for patent infringement against Boston Scientific and a German subsidiary, Boston Scientific Medizintechnik GmbH, alleging that the Lotus heart valve infringes certain claims of Edwards Lifesciences German national patents EP 1 441 672 B1 and 2 255 753 B1 related to prosthetic valve and delivery system technology.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P246_S1	Edwards Lifesciences later added its German national patent EP 2 399 550 to this suit.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P247_S0	The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P247_S1	Trial in the German matter was held in February 2017 and the German district court's decision is expected in the first quarter of 2017.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P248_S0	O n April 19, 2016, Boston Scientific filed a lawsuit against Edwards Lifesciences in the Federal District Court in the District of Delaware alleging that the SAPIEN 3 heart valve infringes certain claims of Boston Scientific s U.S. Patent 8,992,608 (the "'608 patent") related to paravalvular sealing technology and seeking unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P248_S1	On June 9, 2016, Edwards Lifesciences LLC and Edwards Lifesciences PVT, Inc. filed counterclaims alleging that Boston Scientific s Lotus heart valve infringes Edwards Lifesciences U.S. Patents 9,168,133; 9,339,383; and 7,510,575 related to prosthetic valve technology.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P248_S2	Trial is scheduled for July 2018.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P249_S0	On October 12, 2016, Edwards Lifesciences filed an Inter Partes Review ("IPR") request with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office challenging the validity of Boston Scientific s '608 patent.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P250_S0	Also on April 19, 2016, Boston Scientific filed a lawsuit against Edwards Lifesciences in the Federal District Court in the Central District of California alleging that five of its transcatheter heart valve delivery systems and a valve crimper infringe certain claims of eight Boston Scientific U.S. patents.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P250_S1	The complaints seek unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P250_S2	Trial is scheduled for May 2018.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P250_S3	The Company intends to defend itself vigorously in these matters and has filed an IPR request related to the crimping device patent.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P251_S0	Because the ultimate outcome of the above matters involve judgments, estimates and inherent uncertainties, and cannot be predicted with certainty, charges related to such matters could have a material adverse impact on Edwards Lifesciences' financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P251_S1	In addition, Edwards Lifesciences is or may be a party to, or may otherwise be responsible for, pending or threatened lawsuits related primarily to products and services currently or formerly manufactured or performed, as applicable, by Edwards Lifesciences (the "Other Lawsuits").
1099800_17_ITEM8_P251_S2	The Other Lawsuits raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the facts and circumstances of each particular case or claim, the jurisdiction in which each suit is brought, and differences in applicable law.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P251_S3	Management does not believe that any charge relating to the Other Lawsuits would have a material adverse effect on Edwards Lifesciences overall financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P251_S4	However, the resolution of one or more of the Other Lawsuits in any reporting period, could have a material adverse impact on Edwards Lifesciences' net income or cash flows for that period.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P251_S5	The Company is not able to estimate the amount or range of any loss for legal contingencies for which there is no reserve or additional loss for matters already reserved.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P252_S0	Edwards Lifesciences is subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside of the United States.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P253_S0	The operations of Edwards Lifesciences, like those of other medical device companies, involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P253_S1	While it is difficult to quantify the potential impact of continuing compliance with environmental protection laws, management believes that such compliance will not have a material impact on Edwards Lifesciences' financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P254_S0	Edwards Lifesciences conducts operations worldwide and is managed in the following geographical regions: United States, Europe, Japan, and Rest of World.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P254_S1	All regions sell products that are used to treat advanced cardiovascular disease.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P255_S0	The Company's geographic segments are reported based on the financial information provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (the Chief Executive Officer).
1099800_17_ITEM8_P255_S1	The Company evaluates the performance of its geographic segments based on net sales and income before provision for income taxes ("pre-tax income").
1099800_17_ITEM8_P255_S2	The accounting policies of the segments are substantially the same as those described in Note 2.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P256_S0	Segment net sales and segment pre-tax income are based on internally derived standard foreign exchange rates, which may differ from year to year, and do not include inter-segment profits.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P256_S1	Because of the interdependence of the reportable segments, the operating profit as presented may not be representative of the geographical distribution that would occur if the segments were not interdependent.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P257_S0	Net sales by geographic area are based on the location of the customer.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P258_S0	Certain items are maintained at the corporate level and are not allocated to the segments.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P258_S1	The non-allocated items include net interest expense, global marketing expenses, corporate research and development expenses, manufacturing variances, corporate headquarters costs, special gains and charges, stock-based compensation, foreign currency hedging activities, certain litigation costs, and most of the Company's amortization expense.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P258_S2	Although most of the Company's depreciation expense is included in segment pre-tax income, due to the Company's methodology for cost build-up, it is impractical to determine the amount of depreciation expense included in each segment, and, therefore, a portion is maintained at the corporate level.
1099800_17_ITEM8_P259_S0	The Company neither discretely allocates assets to its operating segments, nor evaluates the operating segments using discrete asset information.

1099800_18_ITEM1_P40_S0	The CENTERA valve is designed to offer a low profile, repositionable self-expanding technology that is stable during valve deployment and delivered via a motorized handle.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P41_S0	We are also making significant investments in the development of transcatheter heart valve technologies designed to treat mitral and tricuspid valve diseases and other structural heart conditions.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P41_S1	We are developing potential products for mitral replacement and for mitral and tricuspid repair.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P41_S2	In January 2017, we completed the acquisition of Valtech Cardio Ltd. ("Valtech"), which included the Cardioband technologies for mitral and tricuspid repair.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P41_S3	In addition, we have made investments in several companies that are independently developing less-invasive technologies to treat mitral regurgitation and left ventricular dysfunction.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P42_S0	Our Surgical Heart Valve Therapy development programs include innovative platforms for patients who will continue to be treated surgically, specifically more active patients with more complex combined procedures.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P42_S1	We are also making internal and external investments in the surgical treatment of mitral valve disease, including the December 2017 acquisition of Harpoon Medical, Inc., which is developing beating-heart mitral surgical repair technologies.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P43_S0	In our Critical Care product line, we are pursuing the development of a variety of decision support solutions for our clinicians.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P43_S1	This includes next-generation noninvasive and minimally invasive hemodynamic monitoring systems, and a next-generation monitor platform.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P43_S2	We are also developing a decision support software suite with advanced algorithms for proactive hemodynamic management, including an algorithm that predicts the risk of a patient developing hypotension, and a semi-closed loop system for standardized management of patient fluid levels.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P44_S0	Our research and development activities are conducted primarily in facilities located in the United States and Israel.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P44_S1	Our experienced research and development staff is focused on product design and development, quality, clinical research, and regulatory compliance.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P44_S2	To pursue primary research efforts, we have developed alliances with several leading research institutions and universities, and also work with leading clinicians around the world in conducting scientific studies on our existing and developing products.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P45_S0	Patents, trademarks, and other proprietary rights are important to the success of our business.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P45_S1	We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing innovations, and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P46_S0	We own more than 3,600 issued United States patents, pending United States patent applications, issued foreign patents, and pending foreign patent applications.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P46_S1	We also have licensed various United States and foreign patents and patent applications that relate to aspects of the technology incorporated in certain of our products, including our heart valves and annuloplasty rings.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P46_S2	We also own or have rights in United States and foreign patents and patent applications in the field of transcatheter heart valve repair and replacement.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P46_S3	In addition, we own or have rights in United States and foreign patents and patent applications that cover catheters, systems and methods for hemodynamic monitoring, and vascular access products, among others.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P47_S0	We are a party to several license agreements with unrelated third parties pursuant to which we have obtained, for varying terms, the exclusive or non-exclusive rights to certain patents held by such third parties in consideration for cross-licensing rights and/or royalty payments.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P47_S1	We have also licensed certain patent rights to others.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	We monitor the products of our competitors for possible infringement of our owned and licensed patents.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P48_S1	Litigation has been necessary to enforce certain patent rights held by us, and we plan to continue to defend and prosecute our rights with respect to such patents.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P49_S0	We own certain United States registered trademarks used in our business.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P49_S1	Many of our trademarks have also been registered for use in certain foreign countries where registration is available and where we have determined it is commercially advantageous to do so.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P50_S0	Our products and facilities are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA, European Community Notified Bodies, and the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, to confirm compliance with the various laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, and distribution of our products.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P50_S1	We are also governed by federal, state, local, and international laws of general applicability, such as those regulating employee health and safety, and the protection of the environment.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P50_S2	Overall, the amount and scope of domestic and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our business has increased over time.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P51_S0	In the United States, the FDA has responsibility for regulating medical devices.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P51_S1	The FDA regulates design, development, testing, clinical studies, manufacturing, labeling, promotion, and record keeping for medical devices, and reporting of adverse events, recalls, or other field actions by manufacturers and users to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P51_S2	Many of the devices that we develop and market are in a category for which the FDA has implemented stringent clinical investigation and pre-market clearance or approval requirements.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P52_S0	The process of obtaining FDA clearance or approval to market a product is resource intensive, lengthy, and costly.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P52_S1	FDA review may involve substantial delays that adversely affect the marketing and sale of our products.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P52_S2	A number of our products are pending regulatory clearance or approval to begin commercial sales in various markets.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P52_S3	Ultimately, the FDA may not authorize the commercial release of a medical device if it determines the device is not safe and effective or does not meet other standards for clearance.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P52_S4	Additionally, even if a product is cleared or approved, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of these products once commercialized.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P53_S0	The FDA has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order the repair, replacement, or refund of the costs of such devices, or preclude the importation of devices that are or appear violative.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P53_S1	The FDA also conducts inspections to determine compliance with the quality system regulations concerning the manufacturing and design of devices and current medical device reporting regulations, recall regulations, clinical testing regulations, and other requirements.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P53_S2	The FDA may withdraw product clearances or approvals due to failure to comply with regulatory standards, or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval, and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P53_S3	Additionally, the failure to comply with FDA or comparable regulatory standards or the discovery of previously unknown product problems could result in fines, delays, or suspensions of regulatory clearances or approvals, seizures, injunctions, recalls, refunds, civil money penalties, or criminal prosecution.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P53_S4	Our compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P53_S5	Moreover, the FDA and several other United States agencies administer controls over the export of medical devices from the United States and the import of devices into the United States, which could also subject us to sanctions for noncompliance.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P54_S0	We are also subject to additional laws and regulations that govern our business operations, products, and technologies, including:
1099800_18_ITEM1_P55_S0	the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which can be used to prosecute companies in the United States for arrangements with foreign government officials or other parties outside the United States.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P56_S0	Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal liability, significant fines or penalties, negative publicity, and substantial costs and expenses associated with investigation and enforcement activities.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P57_S0	To assist in our compliance efforts, we adhere to many codes of ethics and conduct regarding our sales and marketing activities in the United States and other countries in which we operate.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P57_S1	In addition, we have in place a dedicated team to improve our internal business compliance programs and policies.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P58_S0	Internationally, the regulation of medical devices is complex.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P58_S1	In Europe, our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P58_S2	The regulatory regime in the European Union for medical devices became mandatory in June 1998.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P58_S3	It requires that medical devices may only be placed on the market if they do not compromise safety and health when properly installed, maintained, and used in accordance with their intended purpose.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P59_S0	National laws conforming to the European Union's legislation regulate our products under the medical devices regulatory system.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P59_S1	Although the more variable national requirements under which medical devices were formerly regulated have been substantially replaced by the European Union Medical Devices Directive, individual nations can still impose unique requirements that may require supplemental submissions.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P60_S0	The European Union medical device laws require manufacturers to declare that their products conform to the essential regulatory requirements after which the products may be placed on the market bearing the CE Mark.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P60_S1	Manufacturers' quality systems for products in all but the lowest risk classification are also subject to certification and audit by an independent notified body.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P61_S0	In Europe, particular emphasis is being placed on more sophisticated and faster procedures for the reporting of adverse events to the competent authorities.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P62_S0	In May 2017, the European Union implemented a new regulatory scheme for medical devices under the Medical Device Regulation ("MDR").
1099800_18_ITEM1_P62_S1	The MDR becomes fully effective in 2020 and will bring significant new requirements for many medical devices, including enhanced requirements for clinical evidence and documentation, increased focus on device identification and traceability, and additional postmarket surveillance and vigilance.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P62_S2	Compliance with the MDR will require re-certification of many of our products to the enhanced standards.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P63_S0	In Japan, pre-market approval and clinical studies are required as is governmental pricing approval for medical devices.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P63_S1	Clinical studies are subject to a stringent "Good Clinical Practices" standard.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P63_S2	Approval time frames from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare vary from simple notifications to review periods of one or more years, depending on the complexity and risk level of the device.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P63_S3	In addition, importation of medical devices into Japan is subject to the "Good Import Practices" regulations.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P63_S4	As with any highly regulated market, significant changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect future sales.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P64_S0	In many of the other foreign countries in which we market our products, we may be subject to regulations affecting, among other things:
1099800_18_ITEM1_P65_S0	Many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the FDA.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P65_S1	In some regions, the level of government regulation of medical devices is increasing, which can lengthen time to market and increase registration and approval costs.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P66_S0	In many countries, the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed and considered eligible for reimbursement.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P67_S0	Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs, including price regulation and competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness reviews, technology assessments, increasing evidentiary demands, and managed-care arrangements, are continuing in many countries where we do business, including the United States, Europe, and Japan.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P67_S1	As a result of these changes, the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical therapies.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P67_S2	For example, government programs, private health care insurance, and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by restricting coverage and limiting the level of reimbursement for procedures or treatments, and some third-party payors require their pre-approval before new or innovative devices or therapies are utilized by patients.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P67_S3	These various initiatives have created increased price sensitivity over medical products generally and may impact demand for our products and technologies.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P68_S0	The delivery of our products is subject to regulation by the Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") in the United States and comparable state and foreign agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P68_S1	Foreign governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P69_S0	Reimbursement schedules regulate the amount the United States government will reimburse hospitals and doctors for the inpatient care of persons covered by Medicare.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P69_S1	HHS' Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services may also review whether and/or under what circumstances a procedure or technology is reimbursable for Medicare beneficiaries.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P69_S2	Changes in current coverage and reimbursement levels could have an adverse effect on market demand and our pricing flexibility.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P70_S0	Health care cost containment efforts have also prompted domestic hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P70_S1	The medical technology industry has also experienced some consolidation, partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P70_S2	As a result, transactions with customers are larger, more complex, and tend to involve more long-term contracts than in the past.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P70_S3	These larger customers, due to their enhanced purchasing power, may attempt to increase the pressure on product pricing.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P71_S0	In 2010, significant reforms to the health care system were adopted as law in the United States as part of the Affordable Care Act ("ACA").
1099800_18_ITEM1_P71_S1	The law included provisions that, among other things, created programs to encourage a shift to value-based care, required all individuals to have health insurance (with limited exceptions), and imposed increased taxes.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P71_S2	The law requires the medical technology industry to pay a 2.3% excise tax on United States sales of most medical devices.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P71_S3	The excise tax, which increased our operating expenses, was suspended for calendar years 2016 through 2019.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P71_S4	Most recently, in December 2017, Public Law 115-97, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "2017 Tax Act"), was enacted and includes several healthcare provisions, including the repeal of the individual insurance mandate.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P71_S5	We do not anticipate that the repeal of the mandate will materially affect our business.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P72_S0	In 2015, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 ("MACRA") was signed into law incentivizing participation in alternative payment models that incentivize high value care.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P72_S1	The long term impact of the provisions in MACRA and the ensuing regulations remains uncertain to us as these programs continue to evolve.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P72_S2	However, we continue to believe that our portfolio is positioned well as the United States healthcare system shifts to value-based care.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P73_S0	In late 2016, legislation was signed into law that, among other things, increases funding for medical research and eases the development and approval of breakthrough treatments.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P73_S1	Known as the 21 st Century Cures Act, the law also provides new funding for the National Institutes of Health and the FDA.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P73_S2	Although it will take some time to be fully implemented, the 21 st Century Cures Act could help accelerate the discovery, development, and delivery of medical advancements to ensure more timely access to new treatments and cures for patients in need.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P74_S0	These laws or any future legislation, including deficit reduction legislation, could impact medical procedure volumes, reimbursement for our products, and demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P75_S0	Our quarterly net sales are influenced by many factors, including new product introductions, acquisitions, regulatory approvals, patient and physician holiday schedules, and other factors.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P75_S1	Net sales in the third quarter are typically lower than other quarters of the year due to the seasonality of the United States and European markets, where summer vacation schedules normally result in fewer medical procedures.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P76_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , we had approximately 12,200 employees worldwide, the majority of whom were located in the United States, Singapore, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P76_S1	Other major concentrations of employees are located in Europe and Japan.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P77_S0	We emphasize competitive compensation, benefits, equity participation, and a positive and attractive work environment in our efforts to attract and retain qualified personnel, and employ a rigorous talent management system.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P77_S1	None of our North American employees are represented by a labor union.
1099800_18_ITEM1_P77_S2	In various countries outside of North America, we interact with trade unions and work councils that represent a limited number of employees.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our business and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	An investor should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P0_S3	If any of these events or circumstances occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be materially harmed.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P0_S4	In that case, the value of our securities could decline and an investor could lose part or all of his or her investment.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P0_S5	In addition, forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws that are contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in our other filings or statements may be subject to the risks described below as well as other risks and uncertainties.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P0_S6	Please read the cautionary notice regarding forward-looking statements in Part 1 above.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our products may become obsolete and our operating results may suffer.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The cardiovascular products industry is characterized by technological changes, frequent new product introductions, and evolving industry standards.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Without the timely introduction of new and improved products, our products could become technologically obsolete or more susceptible to competition and our revenue and operating results would suffer.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Even if we are able to develop new or improved products, our ability to market them could be limited by the need for regulatory clearance, restrictions imposed on approved indications, entrenched patterns of clinical practice, uncertainty over third-party reimbursement, or other factors.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P2_S3	We devote significant financial and other resources to our research and development activities; however, the research and development process is prolonged and entails considerable uncertainty.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Accordingly, products we are currently developing may not complete the development process or obtain the regulatory or other approvals required to market such products in a timely manner or at all.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Technical innovations often require substantial time and investment before we can determine their commercial viability.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We may not have the financial resources necessary to fund all of these projects.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P3_S2	In addition, even if we are able to successfully develop new or improved products, they may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development, and they may be rendered obsolete or less competitive by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products with newer technologies or features or other factors.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We may experience supply interruptions that could harm our ability to manufacture products.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We use a broad range of raw and organic materials and other items from third party vendors in the design and manufacture of our products.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our Surgical and Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy products are manufactured from treated natural animal tissue and man-made materials.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Our non-implantable products are manufactured from man-made raw materials including resins, chemicals, electronics, and metals.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P5_S3	We purchase certain of the materials and components used in the manufacture of our products from external suppliers, and we purchase certain supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance, cost-effectiveness, availability, or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P5_S4	We also contract with third parties for important services related to infrastructure and information technology.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P5_S5	General economic conditions could adversely affect the financial viability of our suppliers, resulting in their inability to provide materials and components used in the manufacture of our products.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P5_S6	While we work closely with suppliers to monitor their financial viability, assure continuity of supply, and maintain high quality and reliability, these efforts may not be successful.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P5_S7	In addition, due to the rigorous regulations and requirements of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products (including the need for approval of any change in supply arrangements), we may have difficulty establishing additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or at all if the need arises.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P5_S8	Certain suppliers may also elect to no longer service medical technology companies due to the high amount of requirements and regulation.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P5_S9	Although alternative supplier options are considered and identified, we typically do not pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships and the time and expense associated with the regulatory validation process.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P5_S10	A change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to product performance or incorporate unique technology, and the loss of any existing supply contract could have a material adverse effect on us.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Regulatory agencies in the United States or other international geographies from time to time have limited or banned the use of certain materials used in the manufacture of our products.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In these circumstances, transition periods typically provide time to arrange for alternative materials.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	In addition, the SEC enacted disclosure rules regarding products that may contain certain minerals that originate from conflict areas in and around the Democratic Republic of Congo.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P6_S3	If we find that certain minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of our products directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups, we may need to source components from alternative suppliers.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P6_S4	If we are unable to identify alternative materials or suppliers and secure approval for their use in a timely manner, our business could be harmed.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Some of our suppliers are located outside the United States.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	As a result, trade or regulatory embargoes imposed by foreign countries or the United States could result in delays or shortages that could harm our business.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	If we or one of our suppliers or logistics partners encounters manufacturing, logistics, or quality problems, including as a result of natural disasters, our business could suffer.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls, due in part to rigorous regulatory requirements.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	In addition, quality is extremely important due to the serious and costly consequences of a product failure.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Problems can arise during the manufacturing process for a number of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow protocols and procedures, raw material problems, software problems, or human error.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Although closely managed, disruptions can occur during implementation of new equipment and systems to replace aging equipment, as well as during production line transfers and expansions.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P9_S4	As we expand into new markets, we may face unanticipated surges in demand which could strain our production capacity.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P9_S5	If these problems arise or if we otherwise fail to meet our internal quality standards or those of the FDA or other applicable regulatory body, which include detailed record-keeping requirements, our reputation could be damaged, we could become subject to a safety alert or a recall, we could incur product liability and other costs, product approvals could be delayed, and our business could otherwise be adversely affected.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	In addition, our manufacturing and warehousing facilities, as well as those of our suppliers and logistics partners, could be materially damaged by earthquakes, hurricanes, volcanoes, fires, and other natural disasters or catastrophic circumstances.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	While we believe that our exposure to significant losses from a catastrophic disaster could be partially mitigated by our ability to manufacture, store, and distribute some of our products at other facilities, the losses could have a material adverse effect on our business for an indeterminate period of time before this transition is complete and operates without significant disruption.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We may be required, from time to time, to recognize charges in connection with the write-down of our assets or dispositions of business operations or for other reasons.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	From time to time, we identify operations and products that are underperforming or not a fit with our longer term business strategy.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We may seek to dispose of these underperforming operations or products.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We may also seek to dispose of other operations or products for strategic or other business reasons.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P12_S3	If we cannot dispose of an operation or product on acceptable terms, we may voluntarily cease operations related to that product.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Any of these events could result in charges, which could be substantial and which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We may not successfully identify and complete acquisitions or strategic alliances on favorable terms or achieve anticipated synergies relating to any acquisitions or alliances, and such acquisitions could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, require significant management resources, and require significant charges or write-downs.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We regularly explore potential acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies, services, or products, as well as potential strategic alliances.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates or appropriate partners with which to form alliances.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Even if we identify appropriate acquisition or alliance candidates, we may be unable to complete the acquisitions or alliances on favorable terms, if at all.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P14_S3	In addition, the process of integrating an acquired business, technology, service, or product into our existing operations could result in unforeseen difficulties and expenditures.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Integration of an acquired company often requires significant expenditures as well as significant management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our other businesses.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Moreover, we may not realize the anticipated financial or other benefits of an acquisition or alliance.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We may be required to take charges or write-downs in connection with acquisitions.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In particular, acquisitions of businesses engaged in the development of new products may give rise to in-process research and development ("IPR D") assets.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P15_S2	To the extent that the value of these assets declines, we may be required to write down the value of the assets.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Also, in connection with certain asset acquisitions, we may be required to take an immediate charge related to acquired IPR D. Either of these situations could result in substantial charges, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Future acquisitions could also involve the issuance of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization of expenses related to other intangible assets, any of which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	In addition, equity or debt financing required for such acquisitions may not be available.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We face intense competition, and if we do not compete effectively, our business will be harmed.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The cardiovascular medical technology industry is highly competitive.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We compete with many companies, some of which are larger, better brand or name recognition, and broader product offerings.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Our customers consider many factors when selecting a product, including product reliability, breadth of product line, clinical outcomes, product availability, price, availability and rate of reimbursement, and services provided by the manufacturer.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P18_S3	In addition, our ability to compete will depend in large part on our ability to develop and acquire new products and technologies, anticipate technology advances, and keep pace with other developers of cardiovascular therapies and technologies.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Our sales, technical, and other key personnel play an integral role in the development, marketing, and selling of new and existing products.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	If we are unable to recruit, hire, develop, and retain a talented, competitive workforce, our ability to compete may be adversely affected.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Our competitive position can also be adversely affected by product problems, physician advisories, and safety alerts, reflecting the importance of quality in the medical technology industry.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Our position can shift as a result of any of these factors.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P19_S3	In addition, given the trend toward value-based healthcare, if we are not able to continue to demonstrate the full value of our products to healthcare providers and payors, our competitive position could be adversely affected.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P19_S4	See " Competition " under " Business " included herein.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Unsuccessful clinical trials or procedures relating to products under development could have a material adverse effect on our prospects.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The regulatory approval process for new products and new indications for existing products requires extensive clinical trials and procedures, including early clinical feasibility and regulatory studies.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from current or future clinical trials or procedures conducted by us, our competitors, or third parties, or perceptions regarding this clinical data, could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary approvals and the market's view of our future prospects.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Such clinical trials and procedures are inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that these trials or procedures will be completed in a timely or cost-effective manner or result in a commercially viable product or expanded indication.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Failure to successfully complete these trials or procedures in a timely and cost-effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our prospects.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Further, preliminary results from clinical trials or procedures may be contradicted by subsequent clinical analysis.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	In addition, results from our clinical trials or procedures may not be supported by actual long-term studies or clinical experience.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P22_S2	If preliminary clinical results are later contradicted, or if initial results cannot be supported by actual long-term studies or clinical experience, our business could be adversely affected.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Clinical trials or procedures may be delayed, suspended, or terminated by us, the FDA, or other regulatory authorities at any time if it is believed that the trial participants face unacceptable health risks or any other reasons.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The success of many of our products depends upon strong relationships with certain key physicians.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The development, marketing, and sale of many of our products requires us to maintain working relationships with physicians upon whom we rely to provide considerable knowledge and experience.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	These physicians may assist us as researchers, marketing consultants, product trainers and consultants, inventors, and as public speakers.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	If new laws, regulations, or other developments limit our ability to maintain strong relationships with these professionals or to continue to receive their advice and input, the development and marketing of our products could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	General economic and political conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	External factors can affect our profitability and financial condition.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Such external factors include general domestic and global economic conditions, such as interest rates, tax rates, and factors affecting global economic stability, and the political environment regarding health care in general.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P26_S2	The strength and timing of the current economic recovery remains uncertain, and we cannot predict to what extent the global economic conditions may negatively impact our business.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P26_S3	For example, negative conditions in the credit and capital markets could impair our ability to access the financial markets for working capital or other funds, and could negatively impact our ability to borrow.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P26_S4	An increase in interest rates could result in an increase in our borrowing costs and could otherwise restrict our ability to access the capital markets.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P26_S5	Such conditions could result in decreased liquidity and impairments in the carrying value of our investments, and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P26_S6	These and other conditions could also adversely affect our customers, and may impact their ability or decision to purchase our products or make payments on a timely basis.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Various laws, including the Affordable Care Act, Public Law 115-97, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("the 2017 Tax Act"), the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, and the 21st Century Cures Act, or any future legislation, including deficit reduction legislation, could impact medical procedure volumes, reimbursement for our products, and demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	For more information about these laws as they relate to our business, see the section entitled Health Care Legislation in Part I, Item 1, Business.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	In addition, the 2017 Tax Act has resulted in significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	These changes include a federal statutory rate reduction from 35% to 21%, the elimination or reduction of certain domestic deductions and credits, and limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P28_S2	The 2017 Tax Act also transitions international taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system and includes base erosion prevention measures on non-U.S. earnings, which has the effect of subjecting certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to U.S. taxation as global intangible low-taxed income.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P28_S3	These changes are effective beginning in 2018.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The 2017 Tax Act also includes the Transition Toll Tax, which is a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign subsidiaries' previously untaxed foreign earnings.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The Transition Toll Tax will be paid over an eight-year period, starting in 2018, and will not accrue interest.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Our preliminary estimate of the Transition Toll Tax and the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities is subject to the finalization of management's analysis related to certain matters, such as developing interpretations of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act, changes to certain estimates and amounts related to the earnings and profits of certain subsidiaries, and the filing of our tax returns.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P29_S3	U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions interpreting the 2017 Tax Act may require further adjustments and changes in our estimates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial conditions.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P29_S4	The final determination of the Transition Toll Tax and the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities will be completed as additional information becomes available, but no later than one year from the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our business is subject to economic, political, and other risks associated with international sales and operations, including risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Because we sell our products in a number of countries, our business is subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including risks associated with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Our net sales originating outside the United States, as a percentage of total net sales, were 44% in 2017 .
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P31_S2	We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P31_S3	In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the United States.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Substantially all of our sales outside of the United States are denominated in local currencies, principally in Europe (and primarily denominated in the Euro) and in Japan.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	The United States dollar value of our international sales varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Decreases in the value of the United States dollar to the Euro or the Japanese yen, as well as other currencies, have the effect of increasing our reported revenues even when the volume of international sales has remained constant.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Increases in the value of the United States dollar relative to the Euro or the Japanese yen, as well as other currencies, have the opposite effect.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P32_S4	Significant increases or decreases in the value of the United States dollar could have a material effect on our revenues, cost of sales, and results of operations.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P32_S5	We have a hedging program for certain currencies that attempts to manage currency exchange rate risks to an acceptable level based on management's judgment of the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity, and cost; however, this hedging program does not completely eliminate the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act, and similar laws in other jurisdictions contain prohibitions against bribery and other illegal payments, and make it an offense to fail to have procedures in place that prevent such payments.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Recent years have seen an increasing number of investigations and other enforcement activities under these laws.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Although we have compliance programs in place with respect to these laws, which may be used as a defense to prove we had adequate procedures, no assurance can be given that a violation will not be found, and if found, the resulting penalties could adversely affect us and our business.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The stock market can be volatile and fluctuations in our quarterly sales and operating results as well as other factors could cause our financial guidance to vary from actual results and our stock price to decline.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	From time to time, the stock market experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P35_S1	This volatility can have a significant effect on the market prices of securities for reasons unrelated to underlying performance.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P35_S2	These broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect our stock price, regardless of our operating results.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P35_S3	In addition, the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in response to any of the other risk factors set out above and below, as well as a number of other factors, including the performance of comparable companies or the medical technology industry, or changes in financial estimates and recommendations of securities analysts.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	A high proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to significant selling, research and development, and manufacturing costs.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Thus, small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter, and the price of our common stock could fall.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Other factors that could affect our quarterly sales and operating results include:
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	our ability to expand our operations and the amount and timing of expansion-related expenditures.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The quarterly and full-year financial guidance we provide to investors and analysts with insight to our view of our future performance is based on assumptions about our sales and operating results.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Due to the nature of our business and the numerous factors that can impact our sales and operating performance, including those described above, our financial guidance may vary from actual results.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P38_S2	If we fail to meet any financial guidance that we provide, or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance during the year, the price of our common stock could decline.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The health care industry has been consolidating, and organizations such as GPOs, independent delivery networks, and large single accounts, such as the United States Veterans Administration, continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for many of our health care provider customers.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P40_S1	As a result, transactions with customers are larger and more complex, and tend to involve more long-term contracts.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P40_S2	The purchasing power of these larger customers has increased, and may continue to increase, causing downward pressure on product pricing.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P40_S3	If we are not one of the providers selected by one of these organizations, we may be precluded from making sales to its members or participants.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Even if we are one of the selected providers, we may be at a disadvantage relative to other selected providers that are able to offer volume discounts based on purchases of a broader range of medical equipment and supplies.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P40_S5	Further, we may be required to commit to pricing that has a material adverse effect on our revenues, profit margins, business, financial condition, and results of operations.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P40_S6	We expect that market demand, governmental regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide health care industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances, which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	If third-party payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or impose other cost containment measures to reduce reimbursement levels, our ability to profitably sell our products will be harmed.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We sell our products and technologies to hospitals and other health care providers, all of which receive reimbursement for the health care services provided to patients from third-party payors, such as government programs (both domestic and international), private insurance plans, and managed care programs.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P42_S1	The ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products from private and governmental third-party payors is critical to the success of medical technology companies.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P42_S2	The availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Reimbursement varies from country to country and can significantly impact acceptance of new products.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P43_S1	There can be no assurance that levels of reimbursement, if any, will not be decreased in the future, or that future legislation, regulation, or reimbursement policies of third-party payors will not otherwise adversely affect the demand for and price levels of our products.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The introduction of cost containment incentives, combined with closer scrutiny of health care expenditures by both private health insurers and employers, has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Hospitals or physicians may respond to such cost-containment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other therapies.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs, including price regulation, are underway in several countries around the world.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P45_S1	In many countries, customers are reimbursed for our products under a government operated insurance system.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Under such a system, the government periodically reviews reimbursement levels and may limit patient access.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P45_S3	If a government were to decide to reduce reimbursement levels, our product pricing could be adversely affected.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods as determined by such third-party payors, or was used for an unapproved indication.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Third-party payors may also deny reimbursement for experimental procedures and devices.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We believe that many of our existing products are cost-effective, even though the one-time cost may be significant, because they are intended to improve quality of life and reduce overall health care costs over a long period of time.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P47_S1	We cannot be certain that these third-party payors will recognize these cost savings instead of merely focusing on the lower initial costs associated with competing therapies.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P47_S2	If our products are not considered cost-effective by third-party payors, our customers may not be reimbursed for them, resulting in lower sales of our products.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We may incur losses from product liability or other claims that could adversely affect our operating results.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, and marketing of medical technologies.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Our products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P49_S2	In addition, many of the devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Component failures, manufacturing and assembly flaws, design defects, or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, patients.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Such problems could result in product liability, medical malpractice or other lawsuits and claims, safety alerts, or product recalls in the future, which, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and ability to attract and retain customers.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We may incur charges related to such matters in excess of any established reserves and such charges, including the establishment of any such reserves, could have a material adverse impact on our net income and net cash flows.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Our inability to protect our intellectual property or failure to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of data or other sensitive company information, by cyber-attack or other event, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Our success and competitive position are dependent in part upon our proprietary intellectual property.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P53_S1	We rely on a combination of patents and trade secrets to protect our proprietary intellectual property, and we expect to continue to do so.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Although we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of means, we cannot guarantee that the protective steps we have taken are adequate to protect these rights.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged and held invalid.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P54_S1	In addition, as our patents expire, we may be unsuccessful in extending their protection through patent term extensions.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P54_S2	The expiration of, or the failure to maintain or extend our patents, could have a material adverse effect on us.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We also rely on confidentiality agreements with certain employees, consultants, and other third parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary information.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P55_S1	These agreements could be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for such a breach.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P55_S2	In addition, others could independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary information.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Our intellectual property, other proprietary technology, and other sensitive company information is dependent on sophisticated information technology systems and is potentially vulnerable to cyber-attacks, loss, damage, destruction from system malfunction, computer viruses, loss of data privacy, or misappropriation or misuse of it by those with permitted access, and other events.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P56_S1	While we have invested to protect our intellectual property and other information, and continue to work diligently to upgrade and enhance our systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns, breaches, cyber-attacks, or other events.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, or results of operations.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We spend significant resources to enforce our intellectual property rights, sometimes resulting in litigation.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Intellectual property litigation is complex and can be expensive and time-consuming.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P57_S2	However, our efforts in this regard may not be successful.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P57_S3	We may not be able to detect infringement.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P57_S4	In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Patent litigation can result in substantial cost and diversion of effort.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Intellectual property protection may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, enabling our competitors to capture increased market position.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P58_S2	The invalidation of key intellectual property rights or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits filed to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or prospects.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P60_S0	During recent years, we and our competitors have been involved in substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical technology industry.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P60_S1	From time to time, we have been and may in the future be forced to defend against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, and such intellectual property litigation is typically costly and time-consuming.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Adverse determinations in any such litigation could result in significant liabilities to third parties or injunctions that bar the sale of our products, or could require us to seek licenses from third parties and, if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms, prevent us from manufacturing, selling, or using certain products, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on us.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P60_S3	In addition, some licenses may be non-exclusive, which could provide our competitors access to the same technologies.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Third parties could also obtain patents that may require us to either redesign products or, if possible, negotiate licenses from such third parties.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Such licenses may materially increase our expenses.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P61_S2	If we are unable to redesign products or obtain a license, we might have to exit a particular product offering.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We and our customers are subject to rigorous governmental regulations and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products that are compatible with these regulations.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P62_S1	In addition, failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial sanctions which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P63_S0	The medical technologies we manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities, including regulations that cover the composition, labeling, testing, clinical study, design, sourcing, manufacturing, packaging, marketing, advertising, promotion, and distribution of our products.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We are required to register with the FDA as a device manufacturer.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P64_S1	As a result, we are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA's Quality System Regulation ("QSR") requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, design, quality control, and documentation procedures.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P64_S2	The FDA may also inspect our compliance with requirements related to adverse event reporting, recalls or corrections (field actions), the conduct of clinical studies, and other requirements.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P65_S0	In the European Union, we are required to maintain certain CE Mark and ISO certifications in order to sell our products, and are subject to periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P65_S1	If we or our suppliers fail to adhere to QSR, CE Mark, ISO, or similar requirements, this could delay or interrupt product production or sales and/or lead to fines, difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances, recalls, or other consequences, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or prospects.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Medical devices must receive FDA clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the United States.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P66_S1	In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of approved products that have been commercialized, and can prevent or limit further marketing of a product based upon the results of post-marketing programs.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P66_S2	In addition, the federal Medical Device Reporting regulations require us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P66_S3	Federal regulations also require us to report certain recalls or corrective actions to the FDA.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P66_S4	Furthermore, most major markets for medical devices outside the United States require clearance, approval, or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P66_S5	The process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device, particularly from the FDA and certain foreign governmental authorities, can be costly and time-consuming, and clearances or approvals may not be granted for products or product improvements on a timely basis, if at all.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P66_S6	Delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, clearances or approvals for products or product improvements could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations or prospects.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P67_S0	At any time after approval of a product for commercial sale, the FDA may conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with QSR requirements, and/or current Medical Device Reporting regulations, or other regulatory requirements.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Noncompliance with applicable requirements may subject us or responsible individuals to sanctions including civil money penalties, product seizure, injunction, or criminal prosecution.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P67_S2	In addition, the FDA may withhold or delay pre-market approval of our products until the noncompliance is resolved.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P67_S3	Product approvals by the FDA can also be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Regulatory agencies in the United States or other international geographies from time to time limit or ban the use of certain materials used in the manufacture of our products, require collection and disposal of products at the end of their lifecycle, and require disclosure of the origin of certain raw materials in our products.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Noncompliance with applicable requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P69_S0	The United States Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and similar laws in other jurisdictions, also impose reporting and disclosure requirements on device, pharmaceutical, and biologics companies for certain financial relationships with United States health care providers and teaching hospitals.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Failure to submit required information or submitting incorrect information may result in significant civil monetary penalties.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P70_S0	We are also subject to various United States and international laws pertaining to health care pricing, anti-corruption, and fraud and abuse, including prohibitions on kickbacks and the submission of false claims laws and restrictions on relationships with physicians and other referral sources.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P70_S1	These laws are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation, which could require us to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if we are found not to be in compliance.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P70_S2	Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions against us and our officers and employees, including substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in governmental health care programs.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Despite our implementation of robust compliance processes, we may be subject, from time to time, to inspections, investigations, and other enforcement actions by governmental authorities.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P71_S1	If we are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, the applicable governmental authority can impose fines, delay, suspend, or revoke regulatory clearances or approvals, institute proceedings to detain or seize our products, issue a recall, impose marketing or operating restrictions, enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against us or our officers or employees, and institute criminal prosecution.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P71_S2	Moreover, governmental authorities can ban or request the recall, repair, replacement, or refund of the cost of any device or product we manufacture or distribute.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P71_S3	Any of the foregoing actions could result in decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P71_S4	In addition to the sanctions for noncompliance described above, commencement of an enforcement proceeding, inspection, or investigation could divert substantial management attention from the operation of our business and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Our industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities, which may lead to greater governmental regulation in the future.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P73_S0	In recent years, the medical technology industry has been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny, including by the FDA, numerous other federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities, as well as members of Congress.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P73_S1	This has included increased regulation, enforcement, inspections, and governmental investigations of the medical technology industry and disclosure of financial relationships with health care professionals.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P73_S2	We anticipate that the government will continue to scrutinize our industry closely, and that additional regulation by governmental authorities, both foreign and domestic, may increase compliance costs, exposure to litigation, and other adverse effects to our operations.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P74_S0	We are subject to risks arising from concerns and/or regulatory actions relating to mad cow disease.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Certain of our products, including pericardial tissue valves, are manufactured using bovine tissue.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Concerns relating to the potential transmission of BSE, commonly known as "mad cow disease," from cows to humans may result in reduced acceptance of products containing bovine materials.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P76_S1	Certain medical device regulatory agencies have considered whether to continue to permit the sale of medical devices that incorporate bovine material.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P77_S0	We obtain bovine tissue only from closely controlled sources within the United States and Australia.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P77_S1	The bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valves is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility for the suspected BSE infectious agent.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P77_S2	We have not experienced any significant adverse impact on our sales as a result of concerns regarding BSE, but no assurance can be given that such an impact may not occur in the future.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Use of our products in unapproved circumstances could expose us to liabilities.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P79_S0	The marketing approval from the FDA and other regulators of certain of our products are, or are expected to be, limited to specific indications.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P79_S1	We are prohibited from marketing or promoting any unapproved use of our products.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P79_S2	Physicians, however, can use these products in ways or circumstances other than those strictly within the scope of the regulatory approval.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P79_S3	Although the product training we provide to physicians and other health care professionals is limited to approved uses or for clinical trials, no assurance can be given that claims might not be asserted against us if our products are used in ways or for procedures that are not approved.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Our operations are subject to environmental, health, and safety regulations that could result in substantial costs.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Our operations are subject to environmental, health, and safety laws, and regulations concerning, among other things, the generation, handling, transportation, and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes, the cleanup of hazardous substance releases, and emissions or discharges into the air or water.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P81_S1	We have incurred and may incur in the future expenditures in connection with environmental, health and safety laws, and regulations.
1099800_18_ITEM1A_P81_S2	New laws and regulations, violations of these laws or regulations, stricter enforcement of existing requirements, or the discovery of previously unknown contamination could require us to incur costs or could become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could be material.
1099800_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Dominican Republic lease expires in 2022; the Puerto Rico property has two leases that expire in 2018; the Costa Rica lease expires in 2021; the Horw, Switzerland lease expires in 2018; the Prague, Czech Republic lease expires in 2019; the Tokyo, Japan lease expires in 2018; the Shanghai, China lease expires in 2018; and Singapore has one land lease that expires in 2036 and one that expires in 2041.
1099800_18_ITEM2_P1_S0	We believe our properties have been well maintained, are in good operating condition, and are adequate for current needs.
1099800_18_ITEM2_P1_S1	We plan to renew all leases that expire in 2018, other than the Horw, Switzerland lease, which will be terminated due to the planned closure of our manufacturing plant at that location.
1099800_18_ITEM3_P0_S0	For a description of our material pending legal proceedings, please see Note 17 to the " Consolidated Financial Statements " of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated by reference.
1099800_18_ITEM5_P0_S0	The principal market for our common stock is the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE").
1099800_18_ITEM5_P0_S1	The table below sets forth, for the calendar quarters indicated, the high and low prices of our common stock, as reported by the NYSE.
1099800_18_ITEM5_P1_S0	On January 31, 2018 , there were 10,576 stockholders of record of our common stock.
1099800_18_ITEM5_P2_S0	We have never paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends.
1099800_18_ITEM5_P2_S1	Our current policy is to retain any future earnings for use in our business.
1099800_18_ITEM5_P3_S0	The difference between the total number of shares (or units) purchased and the total number of shares (or units) purchased as part of publicly announced plans or programs is due to shares withheld by us to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units issued to employees.
1099800_18_ITEM5_P4_S0	(b) On November 10, 2016, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to purchase on the open market, including pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan and in privately negotiated transactions, up to $1.0 billion of our common stock.
1099800_18_ITEM5_P4_S1	On November 15, 2017, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program providing for an additional $1.0 billion of repurchases of our common stock.
1099800_18_ITEM5_P5_S0	In November 2017, we paid $150.0 million under our accelerated share repurchase ("ASR") agreement and received an initial delivery of 1.1 million shares of our common stock, representing approximately 80 percent of the total contract value.
1099800_18_ITEM5_P5_S1	In December 2017, the ASR agreement concluded and we received an additional 0.2 million shares.
1099800_18_ITEM5_P6_S0	Shares purchased pursuant to the ASR agreement are presented in the table above in the periods in which they were received.
1099800_18_ITEM5_P7_S0	The following graph compares the performance of our common stock with that of the S P 500 Index and the S P 500 Healthcare Equipment Index.
1099800_18_ITEM5_P7_S1	The cumulative total return listed below assumes an initial investment of $100 at the market close on December 30, 2012 and reinvestment of dividends.
1099800_18_ITEM6_P0_S0	The above results include special charges of $59.9 million during 2017 and $34.5 million during 2016 .
1099800_18_ITEM6_P0_S1	In addition, in 2017, the above results reflect a $262.0 million tax expense related to the implementation of U.S. tax law changes.
1099800_18_ITEM6_P0_S2	Also, the above results include a $112.5 million ($70.3 million, net of tax) litigation payment received in 2017 and $750.0 million ($487.9 million, net of tax) received in 2014 under a litigation settlement.
1099800_18_ITEM6_P0_S3	See Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations " and Note 3, Note 4 and Note 16 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information.
1099800_18_ITEM6_P1_S0	(b) In October 2013, we issued $600.0 million of 2.875% fixed-rate unsecured senior notes due October 15, 2018 (the "Notes").
1099800_18_ITEM6_P1_S1	At December 31, 2017, the Notes were classified as short-term obligations as these obligations were due within one year.
1099800_18_ITEM6_P2_S0	Amounts outstanding under our Five-Year Credit Agreement ("Credit Agreement") have been classified as long-term obligations in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis presents the factors that had a material effect on our results of operations during the three years ended December 31, 2017 .
1099800_18_ITEM7_P0_S1	Also discussed is our financial position as of December 31, 2017 .
1099800_18_ITEM7_P0_S2	You should read this discussion in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	We are the global leader in patient-focused medical innovations for structural heart disease and critical care monitoring.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	Driven by a passion to help patients, we partner with the world's leading clinicians and researchers and invest in research and development to transform care for those impacted by structural heart disease or require hemodynamic monitoring during surgery and in intensive care.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P1_S2	We conduct operations worldwide and are managed in the following geographical regions: United States, Europe, Japan, and Rest of World.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P1_S3	Our products are categorized into the following main areas:
1099800_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy ("THVT"), Surgical Heart Valve Therapy ("SHVT"), and Critical Care.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	Our sales growth was led by our THVT products, primarily due to increased sales of the Edwards SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve in the United States, Japan, and Europe.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	Our gross profit margin in 2017 was positively impacted by an improved product mix, led by THVT products.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P3_S2	Our gross profit margin in 2016 was negatively impacted relative to 2015 by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, partially offset by an improved product mix, led by THVT products.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P3_S3	The increase in our net income in 2017 was primarily driven by our increased sales and a gain from our successful litigation related to the theft of trade secrets, partially offset by increased tax expenses due to the implementation of U.S. tax law changes.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P3_S4	Our net income in 2016 increased compared to 2015 primarily due to increased sales, partially offset by an in-process research and development ("IPR D") charge for technology we acquired for use in our transcatheter heart valve programs.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	The medical technology industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P4_S1	Our success is measured both by the development of innovative products and the value we bring to our stakeholders.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P4_S2	We are committed to developing new technologies and providing innovative patient care, and we are committed to defending our intellectual property in support of those developments.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P4_S3	In 2017 , we invested 16.1% of our net sales in research and development.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P4_S4	The following is a summary of important developments during 2017 :
1099800_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	we received FDA approval for the HemoSphere advanced monitoring platform.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	we received CE mark for Harpoon , our newly acquired beating heart mitral valve repair system.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	We are dedicated to generating robust clinical, economic, and quality of life evidence increasingly expected by patients, clinicians, and payors in the current healthcare environment, with the goal of encouraging the adoption of innovative new medical therapies that demonstrate superior outcomes.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	International net sales include the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net sales is not necessarily indicative of the impact on net income due to the corresponding effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on international manufacturing and operating costs, and our hedging activities.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	The increase in net sales of THVT products in the United States was due primarily to:
1099800_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	the Edwards SAPIEN 3 valve, driven by strong therapy adoption.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	The increase in international net sales of THVT products was due primarily to:
1099800_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	lower sales of the Edwards SAPIEN XT valve as customers converted to Edwards SAPIEN 3.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	The increase in net sales of THVT products in the United States was due primarily to:
1099800_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	lower sales of the Edwards SAPIEN XT valve as customers converted to Edwards SAPIEN 3.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	The increase in international net sales of THVT products was due primarily to increased sales of the Edwards SAPIEN 3 valve, driven primarily by its launch in Europe in January 2014 and in Japan in March 2016.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	In June 2017, we received FDA approval for aortic and mitral valve-in-valve procedures using the Edwards SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve for patients at high risk for a subsequent open-heart surgery to replace their bioprosthetic valve.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	In February 2018, we received CE Mark for our self-expanding CENTERA valve for severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis patients at high risk of open-heart surgery.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	The increase in net sales of SHVT products was due primarily to:
1099800_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	mitral tissue valves, due to increased sales in Rest of World, primarily China.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	The decrease in net sales of SHVT products was due primarily to:
1099800_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which increased net sales by $2.2 million, due primarily to the strengthening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar, partially offset by the weakening of various currencies against the United States dollar.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	In July 2017, we received FDA approval for our INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve, the first in a new class of resilient heart valves.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	In December 2017, we received CE Mark for Harpoon , our newly acquired beating heart mitral valve repair system.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	The increase in net sales of Critical Care products was due primarily to enhanced surgical recovery products and core hemodynamic products, primarily in the United States and Rest of World.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	The increase in net sales of Critical Care products was due primarily to:
1099800_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which increased net sales by $5.0 million due primarily to the strengthening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar, partially offset by the weakening of various currencies against the United States dollar.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	In April 2017, we received FDA clearance for our HemoSphere advanced monitoring platform.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	This technology provides clinicians with clarity on a patient s hemodynamics, or the factors that manage blood flow, to help them make proactive, timely clinical decisions.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2017 compared to 2016 was driven by:
1099800_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	expenses associated with flooding from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico and the planned closure of our manufacturing plant in Switzerland.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2016 compared to 2015 was driven by:
1099800_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	a 1.6 percentage point increase in the United States, and a 0.5 percentage point increase in international markets, due to an improved product mix, driven by THVT products.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	The increase in SG A expenses in 2017 compared to 2016 was due primarily to higher sales and marketing expenses in the United States and Europe, mainly to support the THVT program, and higher personnel-related costs.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	The decrease in SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2017 was due primarily to leverage from our higher THVT sales in the United States and Japan.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	The increase in SG A expenses in 2016 compared to 2015 resulted primarily from higher sales and marketing expenses in the United States and Europe, mainly to support our THVT program, and higher personnel-related costs.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P30_S1	These increases were partially offset by the suspension of the medical device excise tax in the United States for 2016 through 2019.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P30_S2	The decrease in SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2016 was due primarily to higher sales in the United States and Japan.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	The increase in R D expenses in 2017 compared to 2016 was due primarily to mitral, aortic, and tricuspid THVT product development efforts, including development expenses associated with the Cardioband Reconstruction System.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	The increase in R D expenses in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to mitral and aortic THVT product development efforts.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	The suspension of the United States medical device excise tax provided additional flexibility to accelerate investments in structural heart initiatives.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	In November 2017, we recorded a $112.5 million litigation gain related to the theft of trade secrets.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	We incurred external legal costs related to intellectual property litigation of $39.2 million , $32.6 million and $7.0 million during 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	The change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities resulted in income of $9.9 million , net, for the year ended December 31, 2017, and expense of $1.1 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P34_S1	The contingent consideration liability related to one of our previous business acquisitions was reduced by $19.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2017 due to delays in product development, which reduced the probability of milestone achievement.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P34_S2	This gain was partially offset by a $10.0 million expense in 2017 due to changes in the fair value of the liabilities resulting primarily from adjustments to discount rates and accretion of the discount rates due to the passage of time.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	Interest expense was $23.2 million , $19.2 million , and $17.2 million in 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P35_S1	The increase in interest expense for 2017 as compared to 2016 resulted primarily from a higher average debt balance, partially offset by lower average interest rates.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P35_S2	The increase in interest expense for 2016 as compared to 2015 resulted primarily from higher average interest rates.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	Interest income was $20.3 million , $10.8 million , and $7.9 million in 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	The increase in interest income for 2017 and 2016 resulted primarily from higher average interest rates.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	The net foreign exchange losses relate primarily to the foreign currency fluctuations in our global trade and intercompany receivable and payable balances, offset by the gains and losses on derivative instruments intended as an economic hedge of those exposures.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	The loss (gain) on investments primarily represents our net share of gains and losses in investments accounted for under the equity method and realized gains and losses on our available-for-sale money market and cost method investments.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	In March 2016, we contributed $5.0 million to the Edwards Lifesciences Foundation, a related-party not-for-profit organization intended to provide philanthropic support to health- and community-focused charitable organizations.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P39_S1	The contribution was irrevocable and was recorded as an expense at the time of payment.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	Our effective income tax rates for 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 were impacted as follows (in millions):
1099800_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	On December 22, 2017, Public Law 115-97, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("the 2017 Act"), was signed into law.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P41_S1	The 2017 Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, requires companies to pay a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on the cumulative earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, accelerates federal tax depreciation and creates new taxes on certain foreign earnings in future years.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	On December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118") was issued to address the application of GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 Act.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	In accordance with SAB 118, we have estimated provisional amounts for $3.3 million of tax benefits in connection with the remeasurement of certain tax assets and liabilities, and $327.4 million of current tax expense (discussed below) recorded in connection with the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on cumulative earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P42_S2	Additionally, as a result of a revenue procedure issued by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") on February 13, 2018, approximately $32.3 million of tax benefits associated with a tax reform related restructuring may need to be adjusted.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	The changes included in the 2017 Act are broad and complex.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	The final transition impacts of the 2017 Act may differ from the above estimate, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations of the 2017 Act, any further legislative or regulatory actions that arise because of the 2017 Act, any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the 2017 Act, or any updates or changes to the estimates we have utilized to calculate the transition impacts.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P43_S2	Any subsequent adjustment to these amounts will be recorded to current tax expense in the quarter of 2018 when the analysis is complete.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	We did not identify items for which a reasonable estimate of the income tax effects of the 2017 Act could not be determined as of December 31, 2017.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	As mentioned above, the 2017 Act requires a mandatory deemed repatriation of post-1986 cumulative undistributed foreign earnings and profits.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P45_S1	The rate applied for the mandatory deemed repatriation varies depending on whether the earnings and profits are held in liquid or non-liquid assets.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P45_S2	A proportional deduction on the deemed repatriation results in a repatriation toll charge of effectively 15.5% for liquid assets and 8% for non-liquid assets.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	At the election of the taxpayer, the repatriation tax can be paid in installments over eight years.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	We provisionally intend to elect to pay the repatriation tax in installments over eight years.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P47_S1	The deemed repatriation results in a provisional $327.4 million tax obligation which, when offset by the correlative effects of uncertain tax positions of $30.0 million , results in a provisional net increase in tax expense of $297.4 million .
1099800_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	Factors impacting our effective tax rate in 2017 included the one-time impact of the mandatory taxation of previously unrepatriated earnings, partially offset by the revaluation of tax-related balance sheet items due to U.S. tax rate changes.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	In addition, the effective tax rate for 2017 was favorably impacted by the adoption of the new accounting standard for the tax benefit of employee shared-based compensation (see Note 2).
1099800_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , the gross uncertain tax positions were $225.6 million and $245.5 million , respectively.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P49_S1	We estimate that these liabilities would be reduced by $94.0 million and $44.9 million , respectively, from offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes, and timing adjustments.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P49_S2	The net amounts of $131.6 million and $200.6 million , respectively, if not required, would favorably affect our effective tax rate.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of uncertain tax positions, excluding interest, penalties, and foreign exchange, is as follows (in millions):
1099800_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	During 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , we recognized interest expense (benefit), net of tax benefit, of $(7.3) million , $4.0 million , and $3.9 million , respectively, in Provision for Income Taxes on the consolidated statements of operations.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	We strive to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P53_S1	While we have accrued for matters we believe are more likely than not to require settlement, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P53_S2	Furthermore, we may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise our right to appeal.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	The uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues, and issuance of new legislation, regulations, or case law.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P54_S1	We believe that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from our uncertain tax positions.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	At December 31, 2017 , all material state, local, and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2008.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	The IRS has substantially completed its fieldwork for the 2009 through 2012 tax years.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P56_S1	However, the audits have been in suspense pending a final determination with respect to the application for an Advance Pricing Agreement ("APA") discussed below.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P56_S2	As a result of the partial agreement discussed below, the IRS will now be able to finalize their audits of the 2009 through 2011 tax years.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	The IRS began its examination of the 2014 tax year during the fourth quarter of 2016.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	We had been pursuing an APA between the Switzerland and United States governments for the years 2009 through 2013 covering transfer pricing matters with the possibility of a roll-forward of the results to subsequent years.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P58_S1	During December 2017, the U.S. and Swiss Competent Authorities agreed on the terms of several of the transactions covered by the APA, including a rollforward of some of the results through 2020.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P58_S2	The remaining terms of transactions not covered by the final bilateral agreement will be reviewed by the IRS as part of the traditional exam process for the tax years beyond 2011.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P58_S3	These transfer pricing matters are significant to our consolidated financial statements as the disputed amounts are material, and the final outcome is uncertain.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P58_S4	We continue to believe our positions are supportable.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P58_S5	As a result of the bilateral agreement, a reclassification of $73.7 million was made from the long-term liability for uncertain tax positions to current taxes payable, and a $15.2 million tax benefit was recorded during the quarter.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	During 2014, we filed with the IRS a request for a pre-filing agreement associated with a tax return filing position on a portion of the litigation settlement payment received in May 2014.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P59_S1	During the first quarter of 2015, the IRS accepted our request into the pre-filing agreement program.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P59_S2	The closing agreement for this matter was finalized during the fourth quarter of 2016.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P59_S3	There remained a disputed issue and we were accepted into the Fast-Track Appeals process in July 2017.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P59_S4	We met with the Fast-Track Appeals team in October 2017 and were unable to reach an agreement.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P59_S5	We intend to revert to the regular Appeals process on this issue.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P59_S6	We made an advance payment of tax in December 2015 to prevent the further accrual of interest on any potential deficiency.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	We believe that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from our uncertain tax positions.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P60_S1	Based upon the information currently available and numerous possible outcomes, we cannot reasonably estimate what, if any, changes in our existing uncertain tax positions may occur in the next 12 months and thus have recorded the gross uncertain tax positions as a long-term liability.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P60_S2	However, if the appeals process related to the pre-filing agreement or transfer pricing matters is finalized in the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that these events could result in a significant change in our uncertain tax positions within the next 12 months.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	We have received tax incentives in certain non-U.S. tax jurisdictions, the primary benefit of which will expire in 2024.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P61_S1	The tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rates were $81.0 million ( $0.39 per diluted share), $78.7 million ( $0.32 per diluted share), and $60.4 million ( $0.25 per diluted share) for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	Our Dominican Republic branch receives tax incentives, including an exemption from paying Dominican Republic income taxes, under a Free Trade Zone law.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P62_S1	Effective November 9, 2012, the Dominican Republic enacted a law which, among other tax provisions, would apply a 10% withholding tax on dividends or branch remittances from a Free Trade Zone company to its shareholder(s).
1099800_18_ITEM7_P62_S2	The Dominican Republic withholding tax provision was, however, contingent upon certain future events.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P62_S3	On October 5, 2016, the Dominican Republic Ministry of Finance published a notification confirming that the 10% withholding tax on branch remittances would be due and payable by Dominican Republic Free Trade Zone companies for dividends and remittances paid on or after October 5, 2016.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	The impact of this withholding tax has been reflected in our income tax provision.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	Our sources of cash liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, amounts available under credit facilities, and cash from operations.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P64_S1	We believe that these sources are sufficient to fund the current requirements of working capital, capital expenditures, and other financial commitments for the next twelve months from the financial statement issuance date.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P64_S2	However, we periodically consider various financing alternatives and may, from time to time, seek to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	On December 22, 2017, Public Law 115-97, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Act), was signed into law.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P65_S1	The legislation includes extensive changes to the international tax regime.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	The 2017 Act requires a deemed repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign earnings and profits.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P66_S1	The deemed repatriation resulted in a provisional $327.4 million tax obligation.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P66_S2	The one-time transition tax liability will be payable in eight annual installments, as outlined in the contractual obligations table below.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P66_S3	See Note 16 to the " Consolidated Financial Statements " for additional information about the one-time transition tax.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held in the United States and outside the United States were $142.3 million and $1.2 billion , respectively.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	Prior to the 2017 Act, we asserted that the accumulated earnings of most of our foreign subsidiaries would be permanently invested.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P68_S1	However, as a result of the 2017 Act, substantially all of the $1.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside the United States will be available for use in the United States without incurring additional United States federal income taxes.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	As we evaluate the impact of U.S. tax legislation and the future cash needs of our global operations, we may revise the amount of foreign earnings considered to be permanently reinvested outside the United States.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	On December 1, 2017, we acquired all the outstanding shares of Harpoon Medical, Inc. for an aggregate cash purchase price of $119.5 million .
1099800_18_ITEM7_P70_S1	In addition, we agreed to pay up to an additional $150.0 million in pre-specified milestone-driven payments over the next 10 years.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	On November 26, 2016, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger to acquire Valtech for approximately $340.0 million , subject to certain adjustments, in stock and cash to be paid at closing, with the potential for up to $350.0 million in additional pre-specified milestone-driven payments over the next 10 years.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P71_S1	Our acquisition of Valtech closed on January 23, 2017, and we issued an aggregate of approximately 2.8 million shares of our common stock, and paid approximately $86.2 million in cash to holders of Valtech securities.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P71_S2	Prior to the close of the transaction, Valtech spun off its early-stage transseptal mitral valve replacement technology program.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P71_S3	We have an option to acquire that program and its associated intellectual property for approximately $200.0 million , subject to certain adjustments, plus an additional $50.0 million if a certain European regulatory approval is obtained within 10 years of the acquisition closing date.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	On July 3, 2015, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger to acquire CardiAQ for an aggregate cash purchase price of $350.0 million, subject to certain adjustments, plus an additional $50.0 million if a certain European regulatory approval is obtained within 48 months of the acquisition closing date.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	We have a Five-Year Credit Agreement ("Credit Agreement") which provides up to an aggregate of $750.0 million in borrowings in multiple currencies.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P73_S1	We may increase the amount available under the Credit Agreement, subject to agreement of the lenders, by up to an additional $250.0 million in the aggregate.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P73_S2	As of December 31, 2017 , borrowings of $438.4 million were outstanding under the Credit Agreement, and have been classified as long-term obligations in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	In October 2013, we issued $600.0 million of 2.875% fixed-rate unsecured senior notes due October 15, 2018.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P74_S1	We plan to issue new notes in 2018 to partially replace the maturing senior notes.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P74_S2	We expect that we will be able to pay the remaining principal and any accrued interest on the senior notes by one or a combination of the following: refinancing such indebtedness, using available cash resources, or using amounts available under our Credit Agreement.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P74_S3	As of December 31, 2017 , the total carrying value of our unsecured senior notes was $598.0 million , which has been classified as short-term debt.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	We periodically repurchase shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P75_S1	We consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, expected dilution from stock plans, cash capacity, and the market price of our common stock.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	amounts purchased under accelerated share repurchase agreements.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P76_S1	As of December 31, 2017 , we had remaining authority to purchase $1.3 billion of our common stock.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P77_S0	Net cash flows provided by operating activities of $1.0 billion for 2017 increased $296.3 million from 2016 due primarily to improved operating performance and receipt of a litigation payment, partially offset by higher working capital needs associated with growth in the business and the timing of tax payments.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P78_S0	Net cash flows provided by operating activities of $704.4 million for 2016 increased $154.7 million from 2015 due primarily to (1) improved operating performance and (2) lower supplier payments in 2016 compared to 2015, partially offset by (1) the impact of excess tax benefits from stock plans, primarily due to our increased stock price, and (2) an increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales, primarily in the United States.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	Net cash used in investing activities of $647.2 million in 2017 consisted primarily of net purchases of investments of $235.7 million , capital expenditures of $168.1 million , a $100.0 million net cash payment associated with the acquisition of Harpoon Medical, Inc., and an $81.9 million net cash payment associated with the acquisition of Valtech.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	Net cash used in investing activities of $211.7 million in 2016 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $176.1 million and $41.3 million for the acquisition of intangible assets.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P81_S0	Net cash used in investing activities of $316.1 million in 2015 consisted primarily of a $320.1 million net payment associated with the acquisition of CardiAQ, and capital expenditures of $102.7 million, partially offset by net proceeds from investments of $119.6 million.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P82_S0	Net cash used in financing activities of $473.2 million in 2017 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of $763.3 million , partially offset by (1) net proceeds from the issuance of debt of $176.3 million and (2) proceeds from stock plans of $113.8 million .
1099800_18_ITEM7_P83_S0	Net cash used in financing activities of $268.5 million in 2016 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of $662.3 million , partially offset by (1) net proceeds from the issuance of debt of $222.1 million, (2) proceeds from stock plans of $103.3 million , and (3) the excess tax benefit from stock plans of $64.3 million .
1099800_18_ITEM7_P84_S0	Net cash used in financing activities of $158.6 million in 2015 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of $280.1 million, partially offset by (1) proceeds from stock plans of $87.2 million, and (2) the excess tax benefit from stock plans of $41.3 million.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P85_S0	A summary of all of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2017 were as follows (in millions):
1099800_18_ITEM7_P86_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ (a) As of December 31, 2017 , we had recorded $327.1 million of income tax liabilities related to the one-time transition tax that resulted from the enactment of the the 2017 Act, which will be payable in eight annual installments.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P86_S1	The first installment is classified as a current income tax payable on our consolidated balance sheet.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P86_S2	The remaining installment amounts will be equal to 8% of the total liability, payable in fiscal years 2019 through 2023, 15% in fiscal year 2024, 20% in fiscal year 2025, and 25% in fiscal year 2026.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P86_S3	See Note 16 to the " Consolidated Financial Statements " for additional information about the one-time transition tax.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P87_S0	(b) The amount included in "Less Than 1 Year" reflects anticipated contributions to our various pension plans.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P87_S1	Anticipated contributions beyond one year are not determinable.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P87_S2	The total accrued benefit liability for our pension plans recognized as of December 31, 2017 was $43.7 million .
1099800_18_ITEM7_P87_S3	This amount is impacted by, among other items, pension expense funding levels, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and investment returns on plan assets.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P87_S4	Therefore, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid, and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P87_S5	See Note 12 to the " Consolidated Financial Statements " for further information.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P88_S0	(c) Capital commitment obligations consist primarily of cash that we are obligated to pay to our limited partnership and limited liability corporation investees.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P88_S1	These investees make equity investments in various development stage biopharmaceutical and medical device companies, and it is not certain if and/or when these payments will be made.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P89_S0	(d) As of December 31, 2017 , the gross liability for uncertain tax positions, including interest, was $235.9 million .
1099800_18_ITEM7_P90_S0	We had been pursuing an APA between the Switzerland and United States governments for the years 2009 through 2013, with the possibility of a roll-forward of the results to subsequent years.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P90_S1	During December 2017, U.S. and Swiss Competent Authorities agreed on the terms of several of the transactions covered by the APA, including a roll-forward of some of the results through 2020.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P90_S2	The remaining terms of transactions not covered by the final bilateral agreement will be reviewed by the IRS as part of the traditional exam process for the tax years beyond 2011.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P90_S3	These transfer pricing matters are significant to our consolidated financial statements, and the final outcome of the negotiations is uncertain.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P90_S4	Management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result for our uncertain tax positions.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P90_S5	We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid, and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P91_S0	(e) We acquire assets still in development, enter into research and development arrangements, acquire businesses, and sponsor certain clinical trials that often require milestone, royalty, or other future payments to third-parties, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P91_S1	In situations where we have no ability to influence the achievement of the milestone or otherwise avoid the payment, we have included those payments in the table above.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P91_S2	However, we have excluded from the table contingent milestone payments and other contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payments or for which we can avoid making payment by unilaterally deciding to stop development of a product or cease progress of a clinical trial.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P91_S3	We estimate that these contingent payments could be up to approximately $680.0 million if all milestones or other contingent obligations were met.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P91_S4	This amount includes certain milestone-based contingent obligations that may be paid through a combination of cash and issuance of common stock.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P92_S0	Certain of our accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under GAAP.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P92_S1	In evaluating our transactions, management assesses all relevant GAAP and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P93_S0	The application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P93_S1	These matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain, and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P93_S2	Management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements, using historical experience and all available information.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P93_S3	We also use outside experts where appropriate.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P94_S0	We apply estimation methodologies consistently from year to year.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P95_S0	We believe the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P96_S0	When we recognize revenue from the sale of our products, we record an estimate of various sales returns and allowances which reduces product sales and accounts receivable.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P96_S1	These adjustments include estimates for rebates, returns, and other sales allowances.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P96_S2	These provisions are estimated based upon historical payment experience, historical relationship to revenues, estimated customer inventory levels, and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P96_S3	Product returns are not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P96_S4	If the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not approximate future activity, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be impacted.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P97_S0	In addition, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P97_S1	For these transactions, we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P97_S2	Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls, and variation in product utilization all affect the estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P98_S0	Our sales adjustment related to distributor rebates given to our United States distributors represents the difference between our sales price to the distributor (at our distributor "list price") and the negotiated price to be paid by the end-customer.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P98_S1	We validate the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from our distributors or an estimate of the distributor's inventory.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P98_S2	This distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P98_S3	We periodically monitor current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the credit for future distributor rebates is fairly stated.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P99_S0	The valuation of our inventory requires us to estimate excess, obsolete, and expired inventory.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P99_S1	We base our provisions for excess, obsolete, and expired inventory on our estimates of forecasted net sales.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P99_S2	A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional allowances for excess, obsolete, and expired inventory in the future.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P99_S3	In addition, our industry is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P99_S4	Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls, increasing levels of consigned inventory, and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess, obsolete, and expired inventory.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P100_S0	We acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations and asset purchases.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P100_S1	The acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value, which is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P100_S2	The determination of fair value requires significant estimates, including, but not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate used to discount those cash flows, the assessment of the asset's life cycle, including the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects, and the consideration of legal, technical, regulatory, economic, and competitive risks.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P101_S0	IPR D acquired in business combinations is reviewed for impairment annually, or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P102_S0	carrying amounts of other intangible and long-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P102_S1	The impairment reviews require significant estimates about fair value, including estimation of future cash flows, selection of an appropriate discount rate, and estimates of long-term growth rates.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P103_S0	We record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P103_S1	We determine the fair value of the contingent consideration based primarily on the following factors:
1099800_18_ITEM7_P104_S0	On a quarterly basis, we revalue these obligations and record changes in their fair value as an adjustment to earnings.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P104_S1	Changes to contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to discount rates, accretion of the discount rates due to the passage of time, changes in our estimates of the likelihood or timing of achieving development or commercial milestones, changes in the probability of certain clinical events, or changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P105_S0	The assumptions related to determining the value of contingent consideration include a significant amount of judgment, and any changes in the underlying estimates could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense recorded in any given period.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P106_S0	The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P106_S1	Realization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P106_S2	Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P107_S0	Due to the complexity of the new provisions of Public Law 115-97, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("the 2017 Act"), we are still evaluating whether we will recognize the U.S. tax effects of global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") as a component of income tax expense in the period the tax arises (the "period cost method") or account for GILTI in the measurement of deferred taxes (the "deferred method").
1099800_18_ITEM7_P107_S1	We have not yet elected a method and will only do so after our completion of the analysis of the GILTI provisions.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P108_S0	We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P108_S1	Our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P108_S2	These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income amongst various tax jurisdictions.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P108_S3	We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P108_S4	Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions, including estimating the ultimate resolution to intercompany pricing controversies between countries when there are numerous possible outcomes.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P108_S5	We review these tax uncertainties quarterly and adjust the liability as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as the progress of tax audits, lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues, and issuance of new legislation, regulations, or case law.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P109_S0	We measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards based on estimated fair values.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P110_S0	Stock-based awards consist of stock options, service-based restricted stock units, market-based restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units, and employee stock purchase subscriptions.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P110_S1	The fair value of each option award and employee stock purchase subscription is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P110_S2	The fair value of market-based restricted stock units is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which uses multiple input variables to determine the probability of satisfying the market condition requirements.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P110_S3	The Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo models require various highly judgmental assumptions, including stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected option term.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P111_S0	performance-based restricted stock units, expense is recognized if and when we conclude that it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved, which requires judgment.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P111_S1	Stock-based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P111_S2	Judgment is required in estimating the stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited.
1099800_18_ITEM7_P111_S3	If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations would be impacted.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets, including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We manage these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Our investment strategy is focused on preserving capital and supporting our liquidity requirements, while earning a reasonable market return.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P1_S2	We invest in a variety of fixed-rate debt securities, primarily time deposits, commercial paper, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, and municipal debt securities.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P1_S3	The market value of our investments may decline if current market interest rates rise.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P1_S4	As of December 31, 2017 , we had $1.1 billion of investments in fixed-rate debt securities which had an average remaining term to maturity of approximately 0.9 years.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P1_S5	Taking into consideration the average maturity of our fixed-rate debt securities, a hypothetical 0.5% to 1.0% absolute increase in interest rates at December 31, 2017 would have resulted in a $4.9 million to $9.7 million decrease in the fair value of these investments.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P1_S6	Such a decrease would only result in a realized loss if we choose or are forced to sell the investments before the scheduled maturity, which we currently do not anticipate.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We are also exposed to interest rate risk on our debt obligations.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P2_S1	As of December 31, 2017 , we had $600.0 million of Notes outstanding that carry a fixed rate, and also had available a $750.0 million Credit Agreement that carries a variable interest rate based on the London interbank offered rate ("LIBOR").
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P2_S2	As of December 31, 2017 , borrowings of $438.4 million were outstanding under the Credit Agreement.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	To diversify our interest rate risk, we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300.0 million.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The critical terms of the swaps matched the critical terms of $300.0 million of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, effectively converting that portion of the fixed-rate issue to a floating variable rate based on a 6-month LIBOR benchmark.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P3_S2	In December 2017, the interest rate swap was settled.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Based on our December 31, 2017 variable debt levels, a hypothetical 1.0% absolute increase in our floating market interest rates would increase our interest expense by approximately $4.4 million, most of which would be offset by increased returns on our short-term investments.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The impact on net interest would be immaterial to our financial condition and results of operations.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P5_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , a hypothetical 1.0% absolute increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of the fixed-rate debt by approximately $4.6 million.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P5_S1	This hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixed-rate debt.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P6_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P6_S1	These risks include the translation of local currency balances and results of our non-United States subsidiaries into United States dollars, currency gains and losses related to intercompany and third-party transactions denominated in currencies other than a location's functional currency, and currency gains and losses associated with intercompany loans.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P6_S2	Our principal currency exposures relate to the Euro and the Japanese yen.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P6_S3	Our objective is to minimize the volatility of our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and the use of derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options contracts.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P6_S4	The total notional amount of our derivative financial instruments entered into for foreign currency management purposes at December 31, 2017 was $979.8 million .
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P6_S5	A hypothetical 10% increase/decrease in the value of the United States dollar against all hedged currencies would increase/decrease the fair value of these derivative contracts by $66.1 million.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P6_S6	Any gains or losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions, so the net impact would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Derivative financial instruments involve credit risk in the event the financial institution counterparty should default.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P7_S1	It is our policy to execute such instruments with major financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P7_S2	At December 31, 2017 , all derivative financial instruments were with bank counterparties assigned investment grade ratings by national rating agencies.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P7_S3	We further diversify our derivative financial instruments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P7_S4	We have not experienced a counterparty default and do not anticipate any non-performance by our current derivative counterparties.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P8_S0	We invest excess cash in a variety of fixed-rate debt securities, and diversify the investments between financial institutions.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P8_S1	Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P9_S0	In the normal course of business, we provide credit to customers in the health care industry, perform credit evaluations of these customers, and maintain allowances for potential credit losses, which have historically been adequate compared to actual losses.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P9_S1	In 2017 , we had no customers that represented 10% or more of our total net sales or accounts receivable, net.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P10_S0	We are exposed to investment risks related to changes in the underlying financial condition and credit capacity of certain of our investments.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P10_S1	As of December 31, 2017 , we had $1.1 billion of investments in fixed-rate debt securities of various companies, of which $552.2 million were long-term.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P10_S2	In addition, we had $14.8 million of investments in equity instruments of public and private companies.
1099800_18_ITEM7A_P10_S3	Should these companies experience a decline in financial condition or credit capacity, or fail to meet certain development milestones, a decline in the investments' values may occur, resulting in unrealized or realized losses.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	For the Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015:
1099800_18_ITEM8_P1_S0	Other schedules are not applicable and have not been submitted.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P2_S0	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Edwards Lifesciences Corporation:
1099800_18_ITEM8_P3_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Edwards Lifesciences Corporation and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ).
1099800_18_ITEM8_P3_S1	We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1099800_18_ITEM8_P4_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P4_S1	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P5_S0	The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, appearing under Item 9A.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P5_S1	Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P5_S2	We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P6_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P6_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P7_S0	Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P7_S1	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P7_S2	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P7_S3	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P7_S4	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P7_S5	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P8_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P8_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P9_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P9_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P10_S0	We have served as the Company s auditor since 1999.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P11_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P12_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P13_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P14_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P15_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P16_S0	Edwards Lifesciences Corporation ("Edwards Lifesciences" or the "Company") conducts operations worldwide and is managed in the following geographical regions: United States, Europe, Japan, and Rest of World.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P16_S1	Edwards Lifesciences is focused on technologies that treat structural heart disease and critically ill patients.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P16_S2	The products and technologies provided by Edwards Lifesciences are categorized into the following main areas:
1099800_18_ITEM8_P16_S3	Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy, Surgical Heart Valve Therapy, and Critical Care.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P17_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Edwards Lifesciences and its majority-owned subsidiaries.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P17_S1	All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P18_S0	The Company reviews its investments in other entities to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity ("VIE").
1099800_18_ITEM8_P18_S1	The Company would be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, and would be required to consolidate the VIE, if it has the power to direct the significant activities of the entity and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entity that may be significant to the VIE.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P18_S2	Based on the Company's analysis, it determined it is not the primary beneficiary of any VIEs; however, future events may require VIEs to be consolidated if the Company becomes the primary beneficiary.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P19_S0	The consolidated financial statements of Edwards Lifesciences have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") which have been applied consistently in all material respects.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P19_S1	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P19_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P20_S0	When the local currency of the Company's foreign entities is the functional currency, all assets and liabilities are translated into United States dollars at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P20_S1	Income and expense items are translated at the weighted-average exchange rate prevailing during the period.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P21_S0	The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P22_S0	Revenue is considered realized or realizable and earned upon delivery of the product, provided that an agreement of sale exists, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.

1099800_18_ITEM8_P23_S0	The Company's principal sales terms provide for title and risk of loss transferring upon delivery to the customer, limited right of return, and no unusual provisions or conditions.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P23_S1	When the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products, an estimate of various sales returns and allowances is recorded which reduces product sales and accounts receivable.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P23_S2	These adjustments include estimates for rebates, returns, and other sales allowances.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P23_S3	These provisions are estimated and recorded at the time of sale based upon historical payment experience, historical relationship to revenues, estimated customer inventory levels, and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P23_S4	Other than in limited circumstances, product returns are not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P23_S5	In addition, the Company may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P23_S6	For these transactions, the Company defers recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount of product to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer.

1099800_18_ITEM8_P25_S0	The Company's sales adjustment related to distributor rebates given to the Company's United States distributors represents the difference between the Company's sales price to the distributor (at the Company's distributor "list price") and the negotiated price to be paid by the end-customer.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P25_S1	This distributor rebate is recorded by the Company as a reduction to sales and a reduction to the distributor's accounts receivable at the time of sale to a distributor.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P25_S2	The Company validates the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from its distributors or an estimate of its distributor's inventory.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P25_S3	This distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P25_S4	The Company periodically monitors current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the credit for future distributor rebates is fairly stated.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P26_S0	The Company also offers volume rebates to certain group purchasing organizations ("GPOs") and customers based upon target sales levels.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P26_S1	For volume rebates offered to GPOs, the rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and an obligation to the GPOs, as the Company expects to pay in cash.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P26_S2	For volume rebates offered to customers, the rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and accounts receivable, as the Company expects a net payment from the customer.

1099800_18_ITEM8_P34_S0	The Company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer-specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P34_S1	When evaluating its allowances for doubtful accounts related to receivables from customers in certain European countries that have historically paid beyond the stated terms, the Company's analysis considers a number of factors including evidence of the customer's ability to comply with credit terms, economic conditions, and procedures implemented by the Company to collect the historical receivables.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P34_S2	Additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances, if economic conditions are less favorable than the Company has anticipated, or for customer-specific circumstances, such as financial difficulty.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P34_S3	The allowance for doubtful accounts related to both short-term and long-term receivables was $13.7 million and $12.8 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.

1099800_18_ITEM8_P42_S0	Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P43_S0	The Company identifies its reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities, including existing goodwill, to those reporting units.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P43_S1	The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based on the Company's market capitalization and a market revenue multiple.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P43_S2	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, then the Company measures the amount of the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P43_S3	In 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , the Company did not record any impairment loss as the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its respective carrying value.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P44_S0	Indefinite-lived intangible assets relate to in-process research and development ("IPR D") acquired in business combinations.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P44_S1	The estimated fair values of IPR D projects acquired in a business combination which have not reached technological feasibility are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P44_S2	Upon successful completion of the project, the capitalized amount is amortized over its estimated useful life.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P44_S3	If the project is abandoned, all remaining capitalized amounts are written off immediately.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P45_S0	Indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually, or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P45_S1	An impairment loss is recognized when the asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P46_S0	IPR D projects acquired in an asset acquisition are expensed unless the project has an alternative future use.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P46_S1	In 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , the Company did not record any impairment loss related to its IPR D assets.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P47_S0	Management reviews the carrying amounts of other finite-lived intangible assets and long-lived tangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P47_S1	Impairment indicators include, among other conditions, cash flow deficits, historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit, and adverse legal or regulatory developments.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P47_S2	If it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable, based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization periods, their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P48_S0	Estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P48_S1	For the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment, long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P49_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P49_S1	The Company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and adjusting the amount, if necessary.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P49_S2	The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are both historical experience and the Company's forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P49_S3	Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the Company's effective tax rate on future earnings.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P50_S0	Due to the complexity of the new provisions of Public Law 115-97, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Company is still evaluating whether it will recognize the U.S. tax effects of global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") as a component of income tax expense in the period the tax arises (the "period cost method") or account for GILTI in the measurement of deferred taxes (the "deferred method").
1099800_18_ITEM8_P50_S1	The Company has not yet elected a method and will only do so after its completion of the analysis of the GILTI provisions.

1099800_18_ITEM8_P57_S1	Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period calculated using the treasury stock method.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P57_S2	Dilutive potential common shares include employee equity share options, nonvested shares, and similar equity instruments granted by the Company.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P57_S3	Potential common share equivalents have been excluded where their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P58_S0	The table below presents the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (in millions, except for per share information):
1099800_18_ITEM8_P59_S0	Stock options, restricted stock units, and market-based restricted stock units to purchase approximately 1.9 million , 0.9 million , and 1.4 million shares for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively, were outstanding, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P60_S0	The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based awards based on estimated fair values.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P61_S0	Stock-based awards consist of stock options, restricted stock units (service-based, market-based, and performance-based), and employee stock purchase subscriptions.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P61_S1	Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period (vesting period) on a straight-line basis.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P61_S2	For performance-based restricted stock units, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense if and when the Company concludes that it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved, net of estimated forfeitures.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P61_S3	The Company reassesses the probability of vesting at each quarter end and adjusts the stock-based compensation expense based on its probability assessment.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P62_S0	Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

1099800_18_ITEM8_P66_S2	All remaining unvested service-based restricted stock units are immediately forfeited.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P67_S0	For market-based restricted stock units, upon retirement and in certain other specified cases, a participant will receive a pro-rated portion of the shares that would ultimately be issued based on attainment of the performance goals as determined on the vesting date.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P67_S1	The pro-rated portion is based on the participant's whole months of service with the Company during the performance period prior to the date of termination.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P68_S0	The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate and foreign currency risks.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P68_S1	It is the Company's policy not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P69_S0	Derivative financial instruments involve credit risk in the event the counterparty should default.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P69_S1	It is the Company's policy to execute such instruments with global financial institutions that the Company believes to be creditworthy.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P69_S2	The Company diversifies its derivative financial instruments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P69_S3	The Company also uses International Swap Dealers Association master-netting agreements.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P69_S4	The master-netting agreements provide for the net settlement of all contracts through a single payment in a single currency in the event of default, as defined by the agreements.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P70_S0	The Company uses interest rate swaps to convert a portion of its fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P70_S1	These interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges and meet the shortcut method requirements under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P70_S2	Accordingly, changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P71_S0	The Company uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage foreign currency risks.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P71_S1	These contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries, principally the Euro and the Japanese yen.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P71_S2	The Company uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the changes due to currency rate movements in the amount of future cash flows associated with intercompany transactions and certain local currency expenses expected to occur within the next 13 months .

1099800_18_ITEM8_P73_S1	For each derivative instrument that is designated and effective as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized immediately to earnings, and offsets the loss or gain on the underlying hedged item.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P73_S2	The gain or loss on fair value hedges is classified in net interest expense, as they hedge the interest rate risk associated with the Company's fixed-rate debt.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P74_S0	The Company reports in " Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss " the effective portion of the gain or loss on derivative financial instruments that are designated, and that qualify, as cash flow hedges.

1099800_18_ITEM8_P76_S3	The gains and losses on derivative financial instruments for which the Company does not elect hedge accounting treatment are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in each period based upon the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P76_S4	Cash flows from net investment hedges are reported as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows, and cash flows from all other derivative financial instruments are reported as operating activities.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P77_S0	In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an amendment to the guidance on stock compensation.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P77_S1	The amendment simplified several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P77_S2	The guidance was effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P77_S3	The Company adopted this standard effective January 1, 2017.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P77_S4	The impact of the standard was as follows:
1099800_18_ITEM8_P78_S0	the Company recorded excess tax benefits of $53.4 million as a reduction to the provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 .
1099800_18_ITEM8_P79_S0	the new standard eliminates the requirement that excess tax benefits be realized through a reduction in income taxes payable before a company can recognize them.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P80_S0	in the diluted earnings per share calculation, when applying the treasury stock method for shares that could be repurchased, the assumed proceeds no longer include the amount of excess tax benefit.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P81_S0	the new standard requires that excess tax benefits be reported as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P81_S1	Previously, these cash flows were included in financing activities.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P82_S0	the new standard requires that employee taxes paid when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes be reported as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P83_S0	the Company elected not to change its policy on accounting for forfeitures, and continued to estimate forfeitures expected to occur to determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized each period.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P84_S0	In January 2017, the FASB issued an amendment to the guidance on intangible assets.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P84_S1	The amendment simplified how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P85_S0	Step 2 measures a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P85_S1	Instead, under this amendment, an entity performs its goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P85_S2	The guidance was effective for annual or interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.

1099800_18_ITEM8_P208_S0	In November 2017, Edwards entered into an ASR agreement to repurchase $150.0 million of the Company's common stock based on the volume-weighted average price ("VWAP") of the Company's common stock during the term of the agreement, less a discount.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P208_S1	Upon entering into the agreement, Edwards received an initial delivery of 1.1 million shares.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P208_S2	The initial shares were valued at $109.86 per share based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of the agreement, and represented approximately 80% of the total contract value.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P208_S3	In December 2017, the ASR agreement concluded at a VWAP less discount per share price of $114.85 , and the Company received an additional 0.2 million shares under that agreement.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P209_S0	In February 2016, Edwards entered into ASR agreements to repurchase $325.0 million of the Company's common stock based on the VWAP of the Company's common stock during the term of the agreements, less a discount.

1099800_18_ITEM8_P210_S0	The ASR agreements were accounted for as two separate transactions: (a) the value of the initial delivery of shares was recorded as shares of common stock acquired in a treasury stock transaction on the acquisition date and (b) the remaining amount of the purchase price paid was recorded as a forward contract indexed to the Company's own common stock and was recorded in " Additional Paid-in Capital " on the consolidated balance sheets.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P211_S0	The initial delivery of shares resulted in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted-average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P211_S1	The Company determined that the forward contract indexed to the Company's common stock met all the applicable criteria for equity classification and, therefore, was not accounted for as a derivative instrument.

1099800_18_ITEM8_P242_S0	The valuation allowance of $41.6 million as of December 31, 2017 reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized.

1099800_18_ITEM8_P247_S0	The Company has $90.2 million of California research expenditure tax credits it expects to use in future periods.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P247_S1	The credits may be carried forward indefinitely.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P247_S2	Based upon anticipated future taxable income, the Company expects that it is more likely than not that all California research expenditure tax credits will be utilized, although the utilization of the full benefit is expected to occur over a number of years and into the distant future.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P247_S3	Accordingly, no valuation allowance has been provided.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P248_S0	The Company adopted the new accounting standard for employee share-based compensation effective January 1, 2017 (see Note 2).
1099800_18_ITEM8_P248_S1	The new standard eliminates the requirement that excess tax benefits be realized through a reduction in income taxes payable before a company can recognize them.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P248_S2	Upon adoption, the Company recorded a cumulative-effect benefit of $9.3 million in retained earnings for excess tax benefits not previously recognized.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P249_S0	On December 22, 2017, Public Law 115-97, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("the 2017 Act"), was signed into law.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P249_S1	The 2017 Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, requires companies to pay a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on the cumulative earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, accelerates federal tax depreciation and creates new taxes on certain foreign earnings in future years.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P250_S0	On December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118") was issued to address the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 Act.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P250_S1	In accordance with SAB 118, the Company has estimated provisional amounts for $3.3 million of tax benefits in connection with the remeasurement of certain tax assets and liabilities, and $327.4 million of current tax expense (discussed below) recorded in connection with the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on cumulative earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P250_S2	Additionally, as a result of a revenue procedure issued by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") on February 13, 2018, approximately $32.3 million of tax benefits associated with a tax reform related restructuring may need to be adjusted.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P251_S0	The changes included in the 2017 Act are broad and complex.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P251_S1	The final transition impacts of the 2017 Act may differ from the above estimate, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations of the 2017 Act, any further legislative or regulatory actions that arise because of the 2017 Act, any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the 2017 Act, or any updates or changes to the estimates the Company has utilized to calculate the transition impacts.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P251_S2	Any subsequent adjustment to these amounts will be recorded to current tax expense in the quarter of 2018 when the analysis is complete.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P252_S0	The Company did not identify items for which a reasonable estimate of the income tax effects of the 2017 Act could not be determined as of December 31, 2017.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P253_S0	As mentioned above, the 2017 Act requires a mandatory deemed repatriation of post-1986 cumulative undistributed foreign earnings and profits.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P253_S1	The rate applied varies depending on whether the earnings and profits are held in liquid or non-liquid assets.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P253_S2	A proportional deduction on the deemed repatriation results in a repatriation toll charge of effectively 15.5% for liquid assets and 8% for non-liquid assets.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P254_S0	At the election of the taxpayer, the repatriation tax can be paid in installments over eight years .
1099800_18_ITEM8_P255_S0	The Company provisionally intends to elect to pay the repatriation tax in installments over eight years.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P255_S1	The deemed repatriation results in a provisional $327.4 million tax obligation which, when offset by the correlative effects of uncertain tax positions of $30.0 million , results in a provisional net increase in tax expense of $297.4 million .

1099800_18_ITEM8_P257_S0	Prior to the 2017 Act, the Company asserted that accumulated earnings of most of its foreign subsidiaries would be indefinitely reinvested.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P257_S1	However, as a result of the 2017 Act, all of the accumulated earnings of its foreign subsidiaries were subjected to United States federal income tax.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P257_S2	In light of the 2017 Act, the Company's analysis is incomplete at this time with respect to its investment intentions for its accumulated foreign earnings.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P257_S3	During the period prescribed by SAB 118, the Company will evaluate, among other factors, the profitability of its United States and foreign operations and the need for cash within and outside the United States, legal entity capitalization requirements, cash controls imposed in foreign jurisdictions, withholding taxes and the availability to offset with foreign tax credits, cash requirements for capital improvements, acquisitions, market expansion, and stock repurchase programs in determining its investment assertion on its accumulated foreign earnings.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P258_S0	The Company has received tax incentives in certain non-U.S. tax jurisdictions, the primary benefit of which will expire in 2024.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P258_S1	The tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rates were $81.0 million ( $0.39 per diluted share), $78.7 million ( $0.32 per diluted share), and $60.4 million ( $0.25 per diluted share) for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P259_S0	A reconciliation of the United States federal statutory income tax rate to the Company's effective income tax rate is as follows (in millions):
1099800_18_ITEM8_P260_S0	Factors impacting the Company's effective tax rate in 2017 included the one-time impact of the mandatory taxation of previously unrepatriated earnings, partially offset by the revaluation of tax-related balance sheet items due to U.S. tax rate changes required by the 2017 Act.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P260_S1	In addition, the effective tax rate for 2017 was favorably impacted by the adoption of the new accounting standard for the tax benefit of employee shared-based compensation (see Note 2).
1099800_18_ITEM8_P261_S0	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , the gross uncertain tax positions were $225.6 million and $245.5 million , respectively.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P261_S1	The Company estimates that these liabilities would be reduced by $94.0 million and $44.9 million , respectively, from offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes, and timing adjustments.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P261_S2	The net amounts of $131.6 million and $200.6 million , respectively, if not required, would favorably affect the Company's effective tax rate.

1099800_18_ITEM8_P264_S1	As of December 31, 2017 , the Company had accrued $7.4 million (net of $2.9 million tax benefit) of interest related to uncertain tax positions, and as of December 31, 2016 , the Company had accrued $14.7 million (net of $10.8 million tax benefit) of interest related to uncertain tax positions.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P264_S2	During 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , the Company recognized interest expense (benefit), net of tax benefit, of $(7.3) million , $4.0 million , and $3.9 million , respectively, in " Provision for Income Taxes " on the consolidated statements of operations.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P265_S0	The Company strives to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P265_S1	While the Company has accrued for matters it believes are more likely than not to require settlement, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P265_S2	Furthermore, the Company may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise its right to appeal.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P265_S3	The uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues, and issuance of new legislation, regulations, or case law.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P265_S4	Management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from these uncertain tax positions.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P266_S0	At December 31, 2017 , all material state, local, and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2008.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P267_S0	The IRS has substantially completed its fieldwork for the 2009 through 2012 tax years.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P267_S1	However, the audits have been in suspense pending a final determination with respect to the application for an Advance Pricing Agreement ("APA") discussed below.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P267_S2	As a result of the partial agreement discussed below, the IRS will now be able to finalize their audits of the 2009 through 2011 tax years.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P268_S0	The IRS began its examination of the 2014 tax year during the fourth quarter of 2016.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P269_S0	The Company had been pursuing an APA between the Switzerland and United States governments for the years 2009 through 2013 covering transfer pricing matters with the possibility of a roll-forward of the results to subsequent years.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P269_S1	During December 2017, the U.S. and Swiss Competent Authorities agreed on the terms of several of the transactions covered by the APA, including a rollforward of some of the results through 2020.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P269_S2	The remaining terms of transactions not covered by the final bilateral agreement will be reviewed by the IRS as part of the traditional exam process for the tax years beyond 2011.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P269_S3	These transfer pricing matters are significant to the Company's consolidated financial statements as the disputed amounts are material, and the final outcome is uncertain.

1099800_18_ITEM8_P273_S0	The Company believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from its uncertain tax positions.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P273_S1	Based upon the information currently available and numerous possible outcomes, the Company cannot reasonably estimate what, if any, changes in its existing uncertain tax positions may occur in the next 12 months and thus have recorded the gross uncertain tax positions as a long-term liability.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P273_S2	However, if the appeals process related to the pre-filing agreement or transfer pricing matters is finalized in the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that these events could result in a significant change in the Company's uncertain tax positions within the next 12 months.

1099800_18_ITEM8_P276_S0	The Boston Scientific subsidiaries filed counterclaims against Edwards Lifesciences and three of its European subsidiaries alleging that the SAPIEN 3 heart valve infringes certain claims of the same patents and seeking unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief.

1099800_18_ITEM8_P281_S1	On June 9, 2016, Edwards Lifesciences LLC and Edwards Lifesciences PVT, Inc. filed counterclaims alleging that Boston Scientific s Lotus heart valve infringes Edwards Lifesciences U.S. Patents 9,168,133; 9,339,383; and 7,510,575 related to prosthetic valve technology.

1099800_18_ITEM8_P287_S0	Because the ultimate outcome of the above matters involve judgments, estimates and inherent uncertainties, and cannot be predicted with certainty, charges related to such matters could have a material adverse impact on Edwards Lifesciences' financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P288_S0	In addition, Edwards Lifesciences is or may be a party to, or may otherwise be responsible for, pending or threatened lawsuits related primarily to products and services currently or formerly manufactured or performed, as applicable, by Edwards Lifesciences (the "Other Lawsuits").
1099800_18_ITEM8_P288_S1	The Other Lawsuits raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the facts and circumstances of each particular case or claim, the jurisdiction in which each suit is brought, and differences in applicable law.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P288_S2	Management does not believe that any charge relating to the Other Lawsuits would have a material adverse effect on Edwards Lifesciences overall financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P288_S3	However, the resolution of one or more of the Other Lawsuits in any reporting period, could have a material adverse impact on Edwards Lifesciences' net income or cash flows for that period.

1099800_18_ITEM8_P290_S1	While it is difficult to quantify the potential impact of continuing compliance with environmental protection laws, management believes that such compliance will not have a material impact on Edwards Lifesciences' financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P291_S0	Edwards Lifesciences conducts operations worldwide and is managed in the following geographical regions: United States, Europe, Japan, and Rest of World.

1099800_18_ITEM8_P292_S0	The Company's geographic segments are reported based on the financial information provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (the Chief Executive Officer).

1099800_18_ITEM8_P292_S2	The accounting policies of the segments are substantially the same as those described in Note 2.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P293_S0	Segment net sales and segment pre-tax income are based on internally derived standard foreign exchange rates, which may differ from year to year, and do not include inter-segment profits.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P293_S1	Because of the interdependence of the reportable segments, the operating profit as presented may not be representative of the geographical distribution that would occur if the segments were not interdependent.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P294_S0	Net sales by geographic area are based on the location of the customer.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P295_S0	Certain items are maintained at the corporate level and are not allocated to the segments.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P295_S1	The non-allocated items include net interest expense, global marketing expenses, corporate research and development expenses, manufacturing variances, corporate headquarters costs, special gains and charges, stock-based compensation, foreign currency hedging activities, certain litigation costs, and most of the Company's amortization expense.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P295_S2	Although most of the Company's depreciation expense is included in segment pre-tax income, due to the Company's methodology for cost build-up, it is impractical to determine the amount of depreciation expense included in each segment, and, therefore, a portion is maintained at the corporate level.
1099800_18_ITEM8_P296_S0	The Company neither discretely allocates assets to its operating segments, nor evaluates the operating segments using discrete asset information.
