1138118_11_ITEM1_P0_S0	CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc. (which may be referred to in this Form 10-K as the company , we , us and our ) is the world s largest commercial real estate services firm, based on 2010 revenue, with leading full-service operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P0_S1	We offer a full range of services to occupiers, owners, lenders and investors in office, retail, industrial, multi-family and other types of commercial real estate.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P0_S2	As of December 31, 2010, we operated more than 300 offices worldwide, excluding affiliate offices, with approximately 31,000 employees providing commercial real estate services under the CB Richard Ellis and CBRE brand names and development services under the Trammell Crow brand name.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P0_S3	Our business is focused on several competencies, including commercial property and corporate facilities management, tenant representation, property/agency leasing, property sales, valuation, real estate investment management, commercial mortgage origination and servicing, capital markets (equity and debt) solutions, development services and proprietary research.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P0_S4	We generate revenues from contractual management fees and on a per project or transactional basis.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P0_S5	Our contractual, fee-for-services businesses, which generally involve facilities management, property management and mortgage loan servicing, as well as asset management provided by CB Richard Ellis Investors, L.L.C. and its global affiliates, which we also refer to as CBRE Investors, represented approximately 38% of our 2010 revenue.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P0_S6	During the year ended December 31, 2010, we generated revenue from a well-balanced, highly diversified base of clients that includes nearly 80 of the Fortune 100 companies.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P0_S7	We estimate that the following client types accounted for the highest proportion of revenue in 2010: corporations (44%), insurance companies and banks (19%) and pension funds and advisors (10%).
1138118_11_ITEM1_P0_S8	In addition, individuals and partnerships accounted for 7% of revenue, government agencies accounted for 5%, real estate investment trusts, or REITs, accounted for 4% and other types of clients accounted for the remainder.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P0_S9	Many of our clients continue to consolidate their commercial real estate-related needs with fewer providers and, as a result, are awarding their business to providers that have a strong presence in important markets and the ability to provide a complete range of services worldwide.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P0_S10	As a result of this trend and our ability to deliver comprehensive integrated solutions for our clients needs across a wide range of markets, we believe we are well positioned to capture a growing share of our clients commercial real estate services needs.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P0_S11	Since 2006, we have been the only commercial real estate services company included in the S P 500.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P0_S12	In every year since 2008, we have been the only commercial real estate services firm to be included in the Fortune 500 .
1138118_11_ITEM1_P0_S13	Additionally, the International Association of Outsourcing Professionals has included us among the top 100 global outsourcing companies across all industries for four consecutive years, including in 2010 when we ranked 13th overall.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P0_S14	In 2010, we were named the premier real estate services provider globally by a number of institutions, including The Financial Times , Euromoney and the International Property Awards, sponsored by Bloomberg.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	CB Richard Ellis History CB Richard Ellis marked its 104 th year of continuous operations in 2010, tracing our origins to a company founded in San Francisco in the aftermath of the 1906 earthquake.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P1_S1	From those humble beginnings, we have grown into the largest global commercial real estate services firm (in terms of 2010 revenue) through organic growth and a series of strategic acquisitions in the United States and the United Kingdom.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P1_S2	In December 2006, we completed the acquisition of Trammell Crow Company, our largest acquisition to date, which deepened our outsourcing services offerings for corporate and institutional clients, especially project and facilities management, strengthened our ability to provide integrated account management solutions across geographies, and established resources and expertise to offer real estate development services throughout the United States.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	On February 15, 2011, we announced that we had entered into definitive agreements to acquire the majority of the real estate investment management business of Netherlands-based ING Group N.V. (ING) for approximately $940 million in cash.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	Management operations in Europe and Asia, as well as Clarion Real Estate Securities (CRES), its U.S.-based global real estate listed securities business (collectively, ING REIM).
1138118_11_ITEM1_P3_S1	The ING REIM operations being acquired are expected to become part of our Global Investment Management segment (whose business is conducted through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE Investors), which will continue to be an independently operated business segment upon completion of the acquisitions.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P3_S2	CBRE Investors has primarily focused on value-add funds and separate accounts.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P3_S3	ING REIM has primarily focused on core funds and global listed real estate securities funds, except in Asia, where ING REIM manages value-add funds and opportunity funds.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P3_S4	There is expected to be little overlap in the companies client bases, with a majority of CBRE Investors clients being U.S.-based and a majority of ING REIM s clients based in Europe.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P3_S5	We also expect to acquire approximately $55 million of CRES co-investments from ING and potentially additional interests in other funds managed by ING REIM Europe and ING REIM Asia.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P3_S6	In addition, we expect to incur transaction costs relating to the acquisitions of approximately $150 million (pre-tax), including financing, retention and integration costs.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P3_S7	These acquisitions, which we refer to as the REIM Acquisitions, are expected to close in the second half of 2011 and are subject to approval by certain stakeholders, including regulatory agencies in the United States, Europe and Asia.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the assets under management, or AUM, in the ING REIM portfolio we are acquiring totaled approximately $59.8 billion.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P4_S1	CBRE Investors assets under management totaled $37.6 billion as of December 31, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	The methodologies used by the ING REIM business units and CBRE Investors to determine their respective AUM are not the same and, accordingly, the reported AUM of ING REIM would be different if calculated using a methodology consistent with that of CBRE Investors methodology.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P5_S1	To the extent applicable, ING REIM s reported AUM was converted from Euros to U.S. dollars using an exchange rate of $1.3379 per 1.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	ING REIM, when combined with our existing Global Investment Management operations, will provide us with a significantly enhanced ability to meet the needs of institutional investors across global markets with a full spectrum of investment programs and strategies.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P6_S1	We have historically also supplemented our global capabilities through the acquisition of regional and specialty-niche firms that are leaders in their areas of concentration or in their local markets, including regional firms with which we had previous affiliate relationships.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P6_S2	These in-fill acquisitions remain an integral part of our long-term strategy.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	Our Regions of Operation and Principal Services CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc. is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its indirect subsidiaries.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P7_S1	CB Richard Ellis Services, Inc., our direct wholly-owned subsidiary, is also generally a holding company and is the primary obligor or issuer with respect to most of our long-term indebtedness.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P7_S2	We report our operations through the following segments: (1) Americas, (2) EMEA, (3) Asia Pacific, (4) Global Investment Management and (5) Development Services.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P7_S3	Information regarding revenue and operating income or loss, attributable to each of our segments, is included in Segment Operations within the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section and within Note 20 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by reference.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P7_S4	Information concerning the identifiable assets of each of our business segments is also set forth in Note 20 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	The Americas The Americas segment is our largest segment of operations and provides a comprehensive range of services throughout the United States and in the largest metropolitan regions in Canada and selected parts of Latin America through both wholly-owned operations as well as independent affiliated offices.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P8_S1	Our agreements with these independent affiliate offices include licenses to use the CB Richard Ellis name in the relevant territory in return for payments of annual royalty fees to us.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P8_S2	In addition, these agreements also include business cross-referral arrangements between us and our affiliates.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	Most of our advisory services and outsourcing services operations are conducted through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary CB Richard Ellis, Inc.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P9_S1	Our mortgage loan origination and servicing operations are conducted exclusively through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary operating under the name CBRE Capital Markets and its subsidiaries.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P9_S2	Our operations in Canada are conducted through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary CB Richard Ellis Limited.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	Our Americas segment accounted for 62.9% of our 2010 revenue, 62.3% of our 2009 revenue and 62.6% of our 2008 revenue.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P10_S1	Within our Americas segment, we organize our services into the following business areas:
1138118_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	Our advisory services businesses offer occupier/tenant and investor/owner services that meet the full spectrum of marketplace needs, including (1) real estate services, (2) capital markets and (3) valuation.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P11_S1	Our advisory services business line accounted for 35.0% of our 2010 consolidated worldwide revenue, 30.8% of our 2009 consolidated worldwide revenue and 34.6% of our 2008 consolidated worldwide revenue.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P11_S2	Within advisory services, our major service lines are the following:
1138118_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	We provide strategic advice and execution to owners, investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with leasing, disposition and acquisition of property.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P12_S1	Our years of strong local market presence have allowed us to develop significant repeat business from existing clients, including approximately 57% of our revenues from existing U.S. real estate sales and leasing clients in 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P12_S2	This includes referrals associated with our contractual fee-for-services businesses, which generally involve facilities management, property management and mortgage loan servicing, as well as asset management provided by CBRE Investors.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P12_S3	Our real estate services professionals are particularly adept at aligning real estate strategies with client business objectives, serving as advisors as well as transaction executors.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P12_S4	We believe we are a market leader for the provision of sales and leasing real estate services in most top U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau), including Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York and Philadelphia.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P12_S5	Our real estate services professionals are compensated primarily through commission-based programs, which are payable upon completion of an assignment.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P12_S6	Therefore, as compensation is our largest expense, this cost structure gives us flexibility to mitigate the negative effect on our operating margins during difficult market conditions.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	Due to the low barriers to entry and significant competition for quality employees, we strive to retain top professionals through an attractive compensation program tied to productivity.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P13_S1	We also believe we invest in greater support resources than most other firms, including professional development and training, market research and information, technology, branding and marketing.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P13_S2	We also foster an entrepreneurial culture that emphasizes client service and rewards performance.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P13_S3	We further strengthen our relationships with our real estate services clients by offering proprietary research to them through our commercial real estate market information and forecasting unit, CBRE Econometric Advisors (CBRE-EA, formerly CBRE Torto Wheaton Research).
1138118_11_ITEM1_P13_S4	This group provides data and analysis to its clients in various formats, including market outlook reports for the office, industrial, hotel, retail and multi-housing sectors, covering more than 110 metropolitan areas in the United States and Canada.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	In 2005, we combined our investment sales and debt/equity financing professionals into a single fully integrated service offering called CBRE Capital Markets.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P14_S1	The move formalized the collaboration between our investment sales professionals and debt/equity financing experts, which has grown as investors have sought comprehensive capital markets solutions, rather than separate sales and financing transactions.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P14_S2	During 2010, we concluded more than $38.6 billion of capital markets transactions in the Americas, including $24.1 billion of investment sales transactions and $14.5 billion of mortgage loan originations and sales.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	Our mortgage brokerage business originates, sells and services commercial mortgage loans primarily through relationships established with investment banking firms, national banks, credit companies, insurance companies, pension funds and government agencies.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	Our mortgage loan origination volume in 2010 was $10.1 billion, representing an increase of approximately 68% from 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P15_S2	Approximately $4.2 billion of loans in 2010 were originated for federal government sponsored entities, most of which were financed through revolving credit lines dedicated exclusively for this purpose.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P15_S3	Loans financed through the revolving credit lines generally occur with principal risk that is substantially mitigated because before the loan is originated, we obtain either a contractual purchase commitment from the government sponsored entity or a confirmed forward trade commitment for the issuance and purchase of a mortgage backed security that will be secured by the loan.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P15_S4	We advised on the sale of approximately $4.5 billion of under-performing mortgages on behalf of financial institutions in 2010, compared with $0.6 billion in 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P15_S5	In 2010, GEMSA Loan Services, a joint venture between CBRE Capital Markets and GE Capital Real Estate, serviced approximately $112.7 billion of mortgage loans, $54.5 billion of which related to the servicing rights of CBRE Capital Markets.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	We provide valuation services that include market value appraisals, litigation support, discounted cash flow analyses and feasibility and fairness opinions.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	Our valuation business has developed proprietary technology for preparing and delivering valuation reports to our clients, which we believe provides us with an advantage over our competitors.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P17_S1	We believe that our valuation business is one of the largest in the industry.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P17_S2	During 2010, we completed over 31,000 valuation, appraisal and advisory assignments.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	Outsourcing Services Outsourcing is a long-term trend in commercial real estate, with corporations, institutions, public sector entities and others seeking to achieve improved efficiency, better execution and lower costs by relying on the expertise of third-party real estate specialists.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P18_S1	Our outsourcing services primarily include two major business lines that seek to capitalize on this trend: (1) corporate services and (2) asset services.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	Agreements with our corporate services clients are generally long-term arrangements and although they contain different provisions for termination, there are usually penalties for early termination.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P19_S1	Although our management agreements with our asset services clients generally may be terminated with notice ranging between 30 to 90 days, we have developed long-term relationships with many of these clients and we continue to work closely with them to implement their specific goals and objectives and to preserve and expand upon these relationships.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P19_S2	As of December 31, 2010, we managed nearly 1.3 billion square feet of commercial space for property owners and occupiers, which we believe represents one of the largest portfolios in the Americas.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P19_S3	Our outsourcing services business line accounted for 27.9% of our 2010 consolidated worldwide revenue, 31.5% of our 2009 consolidated worldwide revenue and 28.0% of our 2008 consolidated worldwide revenue.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	We provide a comprehensive suite of services to corporate users of real estate, including transaction management, project management, facilities management, strategic consulting, portfolio management and other services.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P20_S1	Our clients are leading global corporations, health care institutions and public sector entities with large, geographically-diverse real estate portfolios.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	Project management services are typically provided on a portfolio-wide or programmatic basis.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	Facilities management involves the day-to-day management of client-occupied space and includes headquarter buildings, regional offices, administrative offices and manufacturing and distribution facilities.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P22_S1	We identify best practices, implement technology solutions and leverage our resources to control clients facilities costs and enhance the workplace environment.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P22_S2	We seek to enter into multi-year, multi-service outsourcing contracts with our clients, but also provide services on a one-off assignment or a short-term contract basis.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P22_S3	We enter into long-term, contractual relationships with these organizations with the goal of ensuring that our clients real estate strategies support their overall business strategies.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	Revenues for project management include fixed management fees, variable fees, and incentive fees if certain agreed-upon performance targets are met.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P23_S1	Revenues may also include reimbursement of payroll and related costs for personnel providing the services.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	structured so we receive reimbursement of client-dedicated personnel costs and associated overhead expenses plus a monthly fee, and in some cases, annual incentives if agreed-upon performance targets are satisfied.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	We provide property management, construction management, marketing, leasing, accounting and financial services on a contractual basis for income-producing office, industrial and retail properties owned by local, regional and institutional investors.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P25_S1	We provide these services through an extensive network of real estate experts in major markets throughout the United States.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P25_S2	These local office delivery teams are supported by a strategic accounts team whose function is to help ensure quality service and to maintain and expand relationships with large institutional clients, including buyers, sellers and landlords who need to lease, buy, sell and/or finance space.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P25_S3	We believe our contractual relationships with these clients put us in an advantageous position to provide other services to them, including refinancing, disposition and appraisal.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	We typically receive monthly management fees for the asset services we provide based upon a specified percentage of the monthly rental income or rental receipts generated from the property under management, or in certain cases, the greater of such percentage fee or a minimum agreed-upon fee.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P26_S1	We are also normally reimbursed for our administrative and payroll costs, as well as certain out-of-pocket expenses, directly attributable to the properties under management.

1138118_11_ITEM1_P36_S1	Rental revenues (which are included in revenue) and expenses (which are included in operating, administrative and other expenses) relating to these operational real estate properties were $41.6 million and $22.4 million, respectively, and were included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	Development Services Operations in our Development Services segment are conducted through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries Trammell Crow Company, Trammell Crow Services, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries, providing development services primarily in the United States to users of and investors in commercial real estate, as well as for its own account.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P37_S1	Trammell Crow Company pursues opportunistic but risk-mitigated development and investment in commercial real estate across a wide spectrum of property types, including industrial, office and retail properties; healthcare facilities of all types (medical office buildings, hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers); higher education facilities (primarily student housing); and residential/mixed-use projects.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P37_S2	Our Development Services segment accounted for 1.5% of our 2010 revenue, 2.1% of our 2009 revenue and 2.3% of our 2008 revenue.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	Trammell Crow Company acts as the manager of development projects, providing services that are vital in all stages of the process, including: (i) site identification, due diligence and acquisition; (ii) evaluating project feasibility, budgeting, scheduling and cash flow analysis; (iii) procurement of approvals and permits, including zoning and other entitlements; (iv) project finance advisory services; (v) coordination of project design and engineering; (vi) construction bidding and management as well as tenant finish coordination; and (vii) project close-out and tenant move coordination.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	Trammell Crow Company may pursue development and investment activity on behalf of its user and investor clients (with no ownership), in partnership with its clients (through co-investment either on an individual project basis or through a fund or program) or for its own account (100% ownership).
1138118_11_ITEM1_P39_S1	Development activity in which Trammell Crow Company has an ownership interest is conducted through subsidiaries that are consolidated or unconsolidated for financial reporting purposes, depending primarily on the extent and nature of our ownership interest.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P40_S0	Trammell Crow Company has established several commingled investment funds to facilitate its pursuit of opportunistic and value added development and investment projects.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P40_S1	In addition, it seeks to channel a large part of its development and investment activity into programs with certain strategic capital partners.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P41_S0	As of December 31, 2010, our portfolio of consolidated real estate consisted of land, industrial, office, retail and medical properties and a mixed-use project.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P41_S1	These projects are geographically dispersed throughout the United States, except for one project, which is located in Canada.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P41_S2	Rental revenues (which are included in revenue) and expenses (which are included in operating, administrative and other expenses) relating to these operational real estate properties, excluding those reported as discontinued operations, were $46.9 million and $24.6 million, respectively, and were included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P42_S0	At December 31, 2010, Trammell Crow Company had $4.9 billion of development projects in process.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P42_S1	Additionally, the inventory of pipeline deals (those projects we are pursuing, which we believe have a greater than 50% chance of closing or where land has been acquired and the project construction start is more than twelve months out) was $1.2 billion at December 31, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P43_S0	Competition We compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate industry, including commercial property and corporate facilities management, tenant representation, property/agency leasing, property sales, valuation, real estate investment management, commercial mortgage origination and servicing, capital markets (equity and debt) solutions, development services and proprietary research.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P43_S1	Each of the business disciplines in which we compete is highly competitive on an international, national, regional and local level.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P43_S2	Although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2010 revenue, our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies, property types and services.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P44_S0	consulting firms, some of which may have greater financial resources than we do.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P45_S0	Despite recent consolidation, the commercial real estate services industry remains highly fragmented and competitive.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P45_S1	Although many of our competitors are local or regional firms and are substantially smaller than us, some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P45_S2	We are also subject to competition from other large multi-national firms that have similar service competencies to ours, including Cushman Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle as well as national firms such as Grubb Ellis.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P46_S0	Seasonality A significant portion of our revenue is seasonal, which can affect an investor s ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P46_S1	Historically, this seasonality has caused our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flows from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P46_S2	Earnings and cash flow have historically been particularly concentrated in the fourth quarter due to investors and companies focusing on completing transactions prior to calendar year-end.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P46_S3	This has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first and second quarters, with revenue and profitability improving in each subsequent quarter.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P47_S0	Employees At December 31, 2010, we had approximately 31,000 employees worldwide, excluding affiliate offices, many of which are in our outsourcing operations and are fully reimbursed by our clients.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P47_S1	At December 31, 2010, 715 of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements, most of whom are on-site employees in our asset services business in New York, New Jersey, Illinois and California.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P48_S0	We believe that relations with our employees are generally good.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P49_S0	We hold various trademarks and trade names worldwide, which include the CB Richard Ellis name.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P49_S1	Although we believe our intellectual property plays a role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve, we do not believe we would be materially, adversely affected by expiration or termination of our trademarks or trade names or the loss of any of our other intellectual property rights other than the CB Richard Ellis , the CBRE and the Trammell Crow names.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P49_S2	With respect to the CB Richard Ellis and CBRE names, we have processed and continuously maintain trademark registrations for these service marks in the United States and the CB Richard Ellis and CBRE related marks are in registration or in process in most foreign jurisdictions where we conduct significant business.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P49_S3	We obtained our most recent U.S. trademark registrations for the CB Richard Ellis and CBRE related marks in 2005, and these registrations would expire in 2015 if we failed to renew them.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P49_S4	We hold a license to use the Trammell Crow trade name pursuant to a license agreement with CF98, L.P., an affiliate of Crow Realty Investors, L.P., d/b/a Crow Holdings, which may be revoked if we fail to satisfy usage and quality control covenants under the license agreement.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P50_S0	In addition to trade names, we have developed proprietary technologies for the provision of complex services through our global outsourcing business and for preparing and developing valuation reports for our clients through our valuation business.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P50_S1	We also offer proprietary research to clients through our CBRE-EA research unit and we offer proprietary investment structures through CBRE Investors.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P51_S0	While we seek to secure our rights under applicable intellectual property protection laws in these and any other proprietary assets that we use in our business, we do not believe any of these other items of intellectual property are material to our business in the aggregate.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P52_S0	Certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability on current or previous real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating, cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property, including contamination resulting from above-ground or underground storage tanks at a property.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P52_S1	If contamination occurs or is present during our role as a property or facility manager or developer, we could be held liable for such costs as a current operator of a property, regardless of the legality of the acts or omissions that caused the contamination and without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P52_S2	The operator of a site also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from exposure to hazardous substances or environmental contamination at a site, including liabilities arising from exposure to asbestos-containing materials.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P53_S0	Under certain laws and common law principles, any failure by us to disclose environmental contamination at a property could subject us to liability to a buyer or lessee of the property.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P53_S1	While we are aware of the presence or the potential presence of regulated substances in the soil or groundwater at or near several properties owned, operated or managed by us, which may have resulted from historical or ongoing activities on those properties, we are not aware of any material noncompliance with the environmental laws or regulations currently applicable to us, and we are not the subject of any material claim for liability with respect to contamination at any location.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P53_S2	However, these laws and regulations may discourage sales and leasing activities and mortgage lending with respect to some properties, which may adversely affect both us and the commercial real estate services industry in general.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P53_S3	Environmental contamination or other environmental liabilities may also negatively affect the value of commercial real estate assets held by entities that are managed by our investment management and development services businesses, which could adversely impact the results of operations of these business lines.

1138118_11_ITEM1_P54_S3	We assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless we are required to do so by law.

1138118_11_ITEM1_P55_S0	Item 1A. Risk Factors Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report and other public statements we make.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P55_S1	Based on the information currently known to us, we believe that the matters discussed below identify the most significant risk factors affecting our business.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P55_S2	However, the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P55_S3	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P55_S4	The consummation and anticipated benefits of the REIM Acquisitions may not be realized as we contemplated .
1138118_11_ITEM1_P56_S0	savings, certain tax benefits and operating efficiencies.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P56_S1	Achieving the anticipated benefits of the REIM Acquisitions will be subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether we successfully close each acquisition as contemplated, integrate the business being acquired, achieve expected synergies, and realize accretive benefits in the timeframe anticipated.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P56_S2	Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits, as well as the failure to successfully implement a plan of financing in connection with the REIM Acquisitions, could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management s time and energy, which could materially impact our overall business, financial condition and operating results.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P57_S0	Completion of each of the REIM Acquisitions is conditioned upon, among other things, approval of certain regulatory authorities in the United States, Europe and Asia.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P57_S1	In addition, the REIM Acquisitions are conditioned upon the receipt of consents from managing boards, investors or other parties necessary to transfer minimum levels of annualized revenue for the accounts managed by ING REIM.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P57_S2	While we and ING intend to pursue vigorously all required approvals and consents, and expect to obtain such approvals and consents by the time such acquisitions are expected to close in the second half of 2011, we can provide no assurance that we will do so successfully or on a timely basis.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P57_S3	In addition, the acquisitions of the U.S.-based global real estate listed securities business, on the one hand, and the real estate investment management business in Europe and Asia, on the other, are not conditioned on each other.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P57_S4	There can be no assurance that both or either of the components of the REIM Acquisitions will be consummated, or as to the timing of the closings of each component.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P57_S5	Any delay in the REIM Acquisitions could diminish the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions and result in additional transaction costs.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P57_S6	In addition, any uncertainty over our ability to complete the REIM Acquisitions could make it more difficult for us to pursue particular business strategies.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P57_S7	The success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and, accordingly, our business could be harmed by an economic slowdown and downturn in real estate asset values, property sales and leasing activities.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P57_S8	Periods of economic weakness or recession, significantly rising interest rates, declining employment levels, declining demand for real estate, declining real estate values, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, may negatively affect the performance of many of our business lines.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P57_S9	These economic conditions can result in a general decline in acquisition, disposition and leasing activity, as well as a general decline in the value of real estate and in rents, which in turn reduces revenue from property management fees and brokerage commissions derived from property sales, leases and mortgage brokerage as well as revenues associated with investment management and/or development activities.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P57_S10	In addition, these conditions can lead to a decline in property sales prices as well as a decline in funds invested in existing commercial real estate assets and properties planned for development.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P58_S0	Our development and investment strategy often entails making relatively modest investments alongside our investor clients.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P58_S1	Our ability to conduct these activities depends in part on the supply of investment capital for commercial real estate and related assets.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P58_S2	During an economic downturn, investment capital is usually constrained and it may take longer for us to dispose of real estate investments or selling prices may be lower than originally anticipated.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P58_S3	As a result, the value of our real estate investments may be reduced and we could realize losses or diminished profitability.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P58_S4	In addition, economic downturns may reduce the amount of loan originations and related servicing by our commercial mortgage brokerage business.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P58_S5	Further, as a result of our debt level and the terms of our existing debt instruments (as described in other risk factors), our exposure to adverse general economic conditions is heightened.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P59_S0	During 2008 and 2009, credit became severely constrained and prohibitively expensive and real estate market activity contracted sharply in most markets around the world as a result of the global financial crisis and the deep economic recession.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P59_S1	These adverse macro conditions impacted real estate services companies like ours by significantly hampering transaction activity and lowering real estate valuations.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P59_S2	Similar to other commercial real estate services firms, our transaction volumes fell during 2008 and most of 2009 and as a result our stock price declined significantly.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P60_S0	If the economic and market conditions that prevailed in 2008 and 2009 were to return, our business performance and profitability could again deteriorate.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P60_S1	If this were to occur, we could fail to comply with certain financial covenants in our credit agreement which would force us to seek an amendment with our lenders.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P60_S2	No assurance can be given that we would be able to obtain any necessary waivers or amendments on satisfactory terms, if at all.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P60_S3	In addition, in an extreme deterioration of our business, we could have insufficient liquidity to meet our debt service obligations when they come due in future years.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P60_S4	Adverse developments in the credit markets may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P60_S5	Our Global Investment Management, Development Services and Capital Markets (including investment property sales and debt and equity financing services) businesses are sensitive to credit cost and availability as well as marketplace liquidity.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P60_S6	Additionally, the revenues in all of our businesses are dependent to some extent on the overall volume of activity (and pricing) in the commercial real estate market.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P61_S0	Disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business of providing advisory services to owners, investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with the leasing, disposition and acquisition of property.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P61_S1	If our clients are unable to procure credit on favorable terms, there may be fewer completed leasing transactions, dispositions and acquisitions of property.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P61_S2	In addition, if purchasers of real estate are not able to procure favorable financing resulting in the lack of disposition opportunities for our funds and projects, our Global Investment Management and Development Services businesses will be unable to generate incentive fees and we may also experience losses of co-invested equity capital if the disruption causes a permanent decline in the value of investments made.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P62_S0	In 2008 and 2009, the credit markets experienced a disruption of unprecedented magnitude.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P62_S1	This disruption reduced the availability and significantly increased the cost of most sources of funding.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P62_S2	In some cases, these sources were eliminated.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P63_S0	While the credit market has shown signs of improving since the second half of 2009, liquidity remains constrained and it is impossible to predict when the market will return to normalcy.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P63_S1	This uncertainty may lead market participants to continue to act more conservatively, which may amplify decreases in demand and pricing in the markets we serve.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P64_S0	Our debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us and, in the event of a default, all of our borrowings would become immediately due and payable.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P64_S1	Our debt instruments, including our credit agreement, impose, and the terms of any future debt may impose, operating and other restrictions on us and many of our subsidiaries.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P64_S2	These restrictions affect, and in many respects limit or prohibit, our ability to:
1138118_11_ITEM1_P65_S0	adversely affect our ability to finance ongoing operations, strategic acquisitions, investments or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest, including:
1138118_11_ITEM1_P66_S0	Our credit agreement currently requires us to maintain a minimum coverage ratio of EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) to total interest expense of 2.25x and a maximum leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) of 3.75x.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P66_S1	Our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure that we will be able to meet those ratios when required.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P66_S2	For example, we experienced a decline in EBITDA during the economic downturn in 2008 to 2009, which negatively impacted our minimum coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P66_S3	However, we significantly reduced our cost structure during 2008 and 2009, and, as a result of these cost reductions as well as renewed growth in our business, we are well within compliance with the minimum coverage ratio and the maximum leverage ratio under our credit agreement.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P66_S4	Our coverage ratio of EBITDA to total interest expense was 8.16x for the year ended December 31, 2010 and our leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to EBITDA was 0.94x as of December 31, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P66_S5	We continue to monitor our projected compliance with these financial ratios and other terms of our credit agreement.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P66_S6	A breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our debt instruments.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P66_S7	If any such default occurs, the lenders under our credit agreement may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P66_S8	The lenders under our credit agreement also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P66_S9	If we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due, the lenders under our credit agreement will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt, which collateral is described in the immediately following risk factor.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P66_S10	If the debt under our credit agreement were to be accelerated, we cannot give assurance that this collateral would be sufficient to repay our debt.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P66_S11	If we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under our credit agreement, the lenders under such credit agreement could foreclose on, and acquire control of, substantially all of our assets.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P66_S12	Our credit agreement is jointly and severally guaranteed by us and substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P66_S13	Borrowings under our credit agreement are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the capital stock of our U.S. subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P66_S14	In addition, in connection with any amendment to our credit agreement, we may need to grant additional collateral to the lenders.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P66_S15	If we are unable to repay outstanding borrowing when due, the lenders under our credit agreement will have the right to proceed against this pledged capital stock and take control of substantially all of our assets.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P66_S16	Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could harm our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P67_S0	We are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P67_S1	As of December 31, 2010, our total debt, excluding notes payable on real estate and warehouse lines of credit (both of which are generally nonrecourse to us), was approximately $1.4 billion.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P67_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2010, our interest expense was approximately $191.2 million.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P67_S3	In connection with the REIM Acquisitions, we also expect to incur approximately $800 million of new term loans under our secured credit agreement to finance such acquisitions.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P68_S0	Our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P68_S1	In addition, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or for other purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P68_S2	If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our debt, would increase.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P68_S3	If we are required to seek an amendment to our credit agreement, our debt service obligations may be substantially increased.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P68_S4	Our debt could have other important consequences, which include, but are not limited to, the following:
1138118_11_ITEM1_P69_S0	our level of debt may restrict us from raising additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and other general corporate requirements.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P69_S1	From time to time, Moody s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard Poor s Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., rate our significant outstanding debt.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P69_S2	These ratings and any downgrades thereof may impact our ability to borrow under any new agreements in the future, as well as the interest rates and other terms of any future borrowings, and could also cause a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P70_S0	We cannot be certain that our earnings will be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P70_S1	If we do not have sufficient earnings, we may be required to seek to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or sell more securities, none of which we can guarantee that we will be able to do and which, if accomplished, may adversely impact our stock price.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P70_S2	We have limited restrictions on the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur, which may intensify the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our indebtedness.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P70_S3	Subject to the maximum amounts of indebtedness permitted by our credit agreement covenants, we are not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur in connection with the financing of our development activities, and we may in the future incur such indebtedness in order to decrease the amount of equity we invest in these activities.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P70_S4	Subject to certain covenants in our various bank credit agreements, we are also not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt CBRE Capital Markets may incur in connection with funding loan originations for multi-family properties having prior purchase commitments by a government sponsored entity.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P70_S5	The deteriorating financial condition and/or results of operations of certain of our clients could adversely affect our business.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P70_S6	We could be adversely affected by the actions and deteriorating financial condition and results of operations of certain of our clients if that led to losses or defaults by one or more of them, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P70_S7	Any of our clients may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its results of operations and financial condition.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P70_S8	As a result, a client may fail to make payments when due, become insolvent or declare bankruptcy.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P70_S9	Any client bankruptcy or insolvency, or the failure of any client to make payments when due, could result in material losses to our company.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P70_S10	A client bankruptcy would delay or preclude full collection of amounts owed to us.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P70_S11	Additionally, certain corporate services and property management client agreements require that we advance payroll and other vendor costs on behalf of clients.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P70_S12	If such a client were to file bankruptcy or otherwise fail, we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for those costs or for the severance obligations we would incur as a result of the loss of the client.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P70_S13	Our goodwill and other intangible assets could become further impaired, which may require us to take significant non-cash charges against earnings.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P70_S14	Under current accounting guidelines, we must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P71_S0	other intangible assets as a result of such analysis would result in a non-cash charge against earnings, which charge could materially adversely affect our reported results of operations and our stock price.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P71_S1	For example, due to the severe market downturn and credit crisis, we determined in December 2008 that the negative impact of the global economic slowdown and resulting decline in our stock price represented an adverse change in our business climate, requiring us to undertake an interim evaluation of our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P71_S2	As a result and as described in the Financial Statements included in this Annual Report, we incurred charges of $1.2 billion in connection with the impairment of goodwill and other non-amortizable intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2008.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P71_S3	A significant and sustained decline in our future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the economic environment, slower growth rates or if our stock price falls below our net book value per share for a sustained period, all could result in the need to perform additional impairment analysis in future periods.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P71_S4	If we were to conclude that a future write-down of goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary, then we would record such additional charges, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P71_S5	Our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees (including those acquired through acquisitions).
1138118_11_ITEM1_P71_S6	Our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees, including Brett White, our Chief Executive Officer.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P71_S7	Mr. White and certain other key employees are not parties to employment agreements with us.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P71_S8	We also are highly dependent upon the retention of our property sales and leasing professionals, who generate a significant majority of our revenues, as well as other revenue producing professionals.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P71_S9	The departure of any of our key employees (including those acquired through acquisitions), or the loss of a significant number of key revenue producers, if we are unable to quickly hire and integrate qualified replacements, could cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to suffer.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P71_S10	In addition, the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified support personnel in all areas of our business, including brokerage and property management personnel.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P71_S11	Competition for these personnel is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit, integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P71_S12	We use equity incentives to help retain and incentivize our key personnel.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P71_S13	Any significant decline in, or failure to grow, our stock price may result in an increased risk of loss of these key personnel.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P71_S14	If we are unable to attract and retain these qualified personnel, our growth may be limited and our business and operating results could suffer.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P71_S15	Our international operations subject us to social, political and economic risks of doing business in foreign countries.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P71_S16	We conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the United States and as a result, we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P71_S17	During 2010, we generated approximately 40% of our revenue from operations outside the United States.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P71_S18	Additional circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations include, but are not limited to, the following factors:
1138118_11_ITEM1_P72_S0	foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in countries such as China.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P73_S0	Although we maintain an anti-corruption compliance program throughout the company, violations of our compliance program may result in criminal or civil sanctions, including material monetary fines, penalties, equitable remedies (including disgorgement), and other costs against us or our employees, and may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P73_S1	We have committed additional resources to expand our worldwide sales and marketing activities, to globalize our service offerings and products in selected markets and to develop local sales and support channels.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P73_S2	If we are unable to successfully implement these plans, maintain adequate long-term strategies that successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P73_S3	Our revenue and earnings may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P73_S4	Our revenue from non-U.S. operations is denominated primarily in the local currency where the associated revenue was earned.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P73_S5	During 2010, approximately 40% of our revenue was transacted in foreign currencies, the majority of which included the Euro, the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar, the Hong Kong dollar, the Japanese yen, the Singapore dollar, the Australian dollar and the Indian rupee.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P74_S0	Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may result in corresponding fluctuations in our revenue and earnings.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P74_S1	Over time fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P74_S2	Due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P74_S3	In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P74_S4	From time to time, our management uses currency hedging instruments, including foreign currency forward and option contracts and borrows in foreign currencies.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P74_S5	Economic risks associated with these hedging instruments include unexpected fluctuations in inflation rates, which impact cash flow and unexpected changes in the underlying net asset position.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P75_S0	Our growth has benefited significantly from acquisitions, which may not be available in the future or perform as expected.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P75_S1	A significant component of our growth has occurred through acquisitions, including our acquisition of the Trammell Crow Company in December 2006.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P75_S2	We have also entered into definitive agreements to acquire ING REIM s operations in Europe and Asia and its CRES business in the United States, as well as certain related co-investments.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P75_S3	Any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions, which may not be available to us, as well as sufficient liquidity and credit to fund these acquisitions.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P75_S4	We may incur significant additional debt from time to time to finance any such acquisitions, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our then-existing indebtedness.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P75_S5	If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our then-existing debt, would increase.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P75_S6	In addition, acquisitions involve risks that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P75_S7	Future acquisitions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transaction-related expenses, which include severance, lease termination, transaction, deferred financing and merger-related costs, among others.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P76_S0	We have had, and may continue to experience, difficulties in integrating operations and accounting systems acquired from other companies.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P76_S1	These challenges include the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of our key employees or those of the acquired operations.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P76_S2	The integration process itself may be disruptive to our business as it requires coordination of geographically diverse organizations and implementation of new accounting and information technology systems.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P77_S0	We believe that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on operating and net income.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P78_S0	involve significant costs related to integrating information technology, accounting and management services and rationalizing personnel levels.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P78_S1	As with prior material transactions, we expect to incur significant integration expenses associated with the expected REIM Acquisitions in 2011 and beyond.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P78_S2	If the properties that we manage fail to perform, then our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P78_S3	The revenue we generate from our asset services line of business is generally a percentage of aggregate rent collections from properties, although many management agreements provide for a specified minimum management fee.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P78_S4	Accordingly, our success partially depends upon the performance of the properties we manage.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P78_S5	The performance of these properties will depend upon the following factors, among others, many of which are partially or completely outside of our control:
1138118_11_ITEM1_P79_S0	governmental regulations, local rent control or stabilization ordinances which are in, or may be put into, effect Our real estate investment and co-investment activities subject us to real estate investment risks which could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flow.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P80_S0	An important part of the strategy for our Global Investment Management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P80_S1	As of December 31, 2010, we had committed $11.5 million to fund future co-investments, all of which is expected to be funded during 2011.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P80_S2	In addition to required future capital contributions, some of the co-investment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P80_S3	The failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments, including damage to our reputation with our co-investment partners and clients, as well as the necessity of obtaining alternative funding from other sources that may be on disadvantageous terms for us and the other co-investors.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P80_S4	Participating as a co-investor is a very important part of our Global Investment Management business, which would suffer if we were unable to make these investments.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P81_S0	Although our debt instruments contain restrictions that limit our ability to provide capital to the entities holding direct or indirect interests in co-investments, we may provide this capital in many instances.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P81_S1	Selective investment in real estate projects is an important part of our Development Services business strategy and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investment.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P81_S2	As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately 50 consolidated real estate projects with invested equity of $30.9 million and $3.7 million of notes payable on real estate that are recourse to us (in addition to being recourse to the single-purpose entity that holds the real estate asset and is the primary obligor on the note payable).
1138118_11_ITEM1_P81_S3	In addition, at December 31, 2010, we were involved as a principal (in most cases, co-investing with our clients) in approximately 45 unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries with invested equity of $31.2 million and had committed additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries of $22.0 million.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P81_S4	We also guaranteed notes payable of these unconsolidated subsidiaries of $1.7 million, excluding guarantees for which we have outstanding liabilities accrued on our consolidated balance sheet.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P82_S0	During the ordinary course of our Development Services business, we provide numerous completion and budget guarantees requiring us to complete the relevant project within a specified timeframe and/or within a specified budget, with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P82_S1	While we generally have guaranteed maximum price contracts with reputable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees (which are intended to pass most of the risk to such contractors), there can be no assurance that we will not have to perform under any such guarantees.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P83_S0	required to perform under a significant number of such guarantees, it could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P83_S1	Because the disposition of a single significant investment can impact our financial performance in any period, our real estate investment activities could increase fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flow.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P83_S2	In many cases, we have limited control over the timing of the disposition of these investments and the recognition of any related gain or loss, or incentive participation fee.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P83_S3	Poor performance of the investment programs that our Global Investment Management business manages would cause a decline in our revenue, net income and cash flow and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future programs.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P83_S4	In the event that any of the investment programs that our Global Investment Management business manages were to perform poorly, our revenue, net income and cash flow could decline because the value of the assets we manage would decrease, which would result in a reduction in some of our management fees, and our investment returns would decrease, resulting in a reduction in the incentive compensation we earn.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P83_S5	Moreover, we could experience losses on co-investments of our own capital in such programs as a result of poor performance.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P83_S6	Investors and potential investors in our programs continually assess our performance, and our ability to raise capital for existing and future programs and maintain our current fee structure will depend on our continued satisfactory performance.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P83_S7	We are subject to substantial litigation risks and may face significant liabilities and damage to our professional reputation as a result of litigation allegations and negative publicity.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P83_S8	The investment decisions we make in our Global Investment Management business and the activities of our investment professionals on behalf of our clients may subject them and us to the risk of third-party litigation arising from investor dissatisfaction with the performance of our programs and a variety of other litigation claims, including allegations that we improperly exercised judgment, discretion, control or influence over client investments or that we breached fiduciary duties to clients.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P83_S9	To the extent investors in our programs suffer losses resulting from fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or other similar misconduct, investors may have remedies against us, our investment programs or funds or our employees under the federal securities law and state law.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P83_S10	Moreover, we are exposed to risks of litigation or investigation by investors and regulators relating to allegations of our having engaged in transactions involving conflicts of interest that were not properly addressed.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P83_S11	We depend on our business relationships and our reputation for integrity and high-caliber professional services to attract and retain clients across our overall business, as well as investors for our Global Investment Management business.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P83_S12	As a result, allegations by private litigants or regulators of improper conduct by us, whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us, as well as negative publicity and press speculation about us or our investment activities, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and damage our business prospects both in our Global Investment Management business and our other global businesses.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P83_S13	In addition, if any lawsuits were brought against us and resulted in a finding of substantial legal liability, it could materially, adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us, which could materially impact our business.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P83_S14	Our joint venture activities involve unique risks that are often outside of our control which, if realized, could harm our business.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P83_S15	We have utilized joint ventures for commercial investments and local brokerage and other affiliations both in the United States and internationally, and although we currently have no specific plans to do so, we may acquire minority interests in other joint ventures in the future.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P83_S16	In many of these joint ventures, we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures and other participants may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P84_S0	participants may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P84_S1	If a joint venture participant acts contrary to our interest, it could harm our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P85_S0	We have numerous significant competitors and potential future competitors, some of which may have greater financial and operational resources than we do.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P85_S1	We compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate services industry, including commercial property and corporate facilities management, tenant representation, property/agency leasing, property sales, valuation, real estate investment management, commercial mortgage origination and servicing, capital markets (equity and debt) solutions, development services and proprietary research.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P85_S2	Although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2010 revenue, our relative competitive position varies significantly across product and service categories and geographic areas.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P85_S3	Depending on the product or service, we face competition from other real estate service providers, including outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have recently expanded their offerings, in-house corporate real estate departments, developers, institutional lenders, insurance companies, investment banking firms, investment managers, and accounting and consulting firms, some of which may have greater financial resources than we do.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P85_S4	In addition, future changes in laws could lead to the entry of other competitors, such as financial institutions.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P85_S5	Many of our competitors are local or regional firms.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P85_S6	Although substantially smaller than us, some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P85_S7	We are also subject to competition from other large national and multi-national firms that have similar service competencies to ours.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P86_S0	There has been a significant increase in recent years in real estate ownership by REITs, many of which self-manage most of their real estate assets.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P86_S1	Continuation of this trend could shrink the asset base available to be managed by third-party service providers and thereby decrease the demand for our services.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P86_S2	In general, there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively, to maintain current fee levels or margins, or maintain or increase our market share.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P86_S3	A significant portion of our operations are concentrated in California and our business could be harmed due to the ongoing economic downturn in the California real estate markets.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P86_S4	During 2010 and 2009, approximately 10% of our revenue was generated from transactions originating in California.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P86_S5	As a result of the geographic concentration in California, the economic downturns in the California commercial real estate market and particularly in the local economies in San Diego, Los Angeles and Orange County could harm our results of operations and disproportionately affect our business as compared to competitors who have less or different geographic concentrations.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P86_S6	If we fail to maintain and protect our intellectual property, or infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, our business could be harmed and we could incur financial penalties.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P86_S7	Our business depends, in part, on our ability to identify and protect proprietary information and other intellectual property (such as our service marks, client lists and information, business methods and research).
1138118_11_ITEM1_P86_S8	Existing laws, or the application of those laws, of some countries in which we operate may offer only limited protections for our intellectual property rights.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P86_S9	We rely on a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality policies, non-disclosure and other contractual arrangements, and on patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P86_S10	Our inability to detect unauthorized use or take appropriate or timely steps to enforce our rights may have an adverse effect on our business.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P86_S11	We cannot be sure that the intellectual property that we may use in the course of operating our business or the services we offer to clients do not infringe on the rights of third parties, and we may have infringement claims asserted against us or against our clients.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P86_S12	These claims may harm our reputation, cost us money and prevent us from offering some services.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P87_S0	Confidential intellectual property is increasingly stored or carried on mobile devices, such as laptop computers, which makes inadvertent disclosure more of a risk in the event the mobile devices are lost or stolen and the information has not been adequately safeguarded or encrypted.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P88_S0	If we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us in our role as a real estate broker, mortgage broker, property/facility manager or developer, we may incur significant financial penalties.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P88_S1	We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations specific to the services we perform in our business, as well as laws of broader applicability, such as tax, securities and employment laws.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P88_S2	Brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions and the provision of property management and valuation services require us to maintain applicable licenses in each U.S. state and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we perform these services.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P88_S3	If we fail to maintain our licenses or conduct these activities without a license, or violate any of the regulations covering our licenses, we may be required to pay fines (including treble damages in certain states) or return commissions received or have our licenses suspended or revoked.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P88_S4	In addition, our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, CBRE Investors, is subject to laws and regulations as a registered investment advisor and compliance failures or regulatory action could adversely affect our business.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P89_S0	As the size and scope of commercial real estate transactions have increased significantly during the past several years, both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with numerous licensing regimes and the possible loss resulting from non-compliance have increased.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P89_S1	Furthermore, the laws and regulations applicable to our business, both within and outside of the United States, also may change in ways that increase the costs of compliance or prevent us from providing certain types of services in connection with certain transactions or clients.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P90_S0	We may have liabilities in connection with real estate brokerage and property management activities.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P90_S1	As a licensed real estate broker, we and our licensed employees are subject to regulatory due diligence, disclosure and standard-of-care obligations.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P90_S2	Failure to fulfill these obligations could subject us or our employees to litigation from parties who purchased, sold or leased properties that we or they brokered or managed.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P90_S3	We could become subject to claims by participants in real estate sales, as well as building owners and companies for whom we provide management services, alleging that we did not fulfill our regulatory and fiduciary obligations.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P91_S0	In addition, in our property management business, we hire and supervise third-party contractors to provide construction services for our managed properties.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P91_S1	While our role is limited to that of an agent for the owner, we may be subject to claims for construction defects or other similar actions.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P92_S0	Adverse outcomes of real estate brokerage or property management litigation could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P92_S1	We may be subject to environmental liability as a result of our role as a property or facility manager or developer of real estate.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P93_S0	Various laws and regulations impose liability on real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating, cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P93_S1	In our role as a property or facility manager or developer, we could be held liable as an operator for such costs.

1138118_11_ITEM1_P93_S3	If we fail to disclose environmental issues, we could also be liable to a buyer or lessee of a property.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P93_S4	If we incur any such liability, our business could suffer significantly as it could be difficult for us to develop or sell such properties, or borrow funds using such properties as collateral.
1138118_11_ITEM1_P93_S5	Additionally, liabilities incurred to comply with more stringent future environmental requirements could adversely affect any or all of our lines of business.

1138118_11_ITEM1_P97_S5	Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable.
1138118_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	Some of our offices that contain employees of our Global Investment Management or our Development Services segments also contain employees of our other business segments.
1138118_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	Often, the employees of these segments occupy separate suites in the same building in order to operate the businesses independently with standalone offices.
1138118_11_ITEM2_P1_S0	We have provided above office totals by geographic region and not listed all of our Global Investment Management and Development Services offices to avoid double counting.
1138118_11_ITEM2_P1_S1	In general, these leased offices are fully utilized.
1138118_11_ITEM2_P2_S0	The most significant terms of the leasing arrangements for our offices are the length of the lease and the rent.
1138118_11_ITEM2_P2_S1	Our leases have terms varying in duration.
1138118_11_ITEM2_P2_S2	The rent payable under our office leases varies significantly from location to location as a result of differences in prevailing commercial real estate rates in different geographic locations.
1138118_11_ITEM2_P3_S0	Our management believes that no single office lease is material to our business, results of operations or financial condition.
1138118_11_ITEM2_P3_S1	In addition, we believe there is adequate alternative office space available at acceptable rental rates to meet our needs, although adverse movements in rental rates in some markets may negatively affect our profits in those markets when we enter into new leases.
1138118_11_ITEM2_P3_S2	We do not own any offices, which is consistent with our strategy to lease instead of own.
1138118_11_ITEM2_P3_S3	Legal Proceedings We are a party to a number of pending or threatened lawsuits arising out of, or incident to, our ordinary course of business.
1138118_11_ITEM2_P3_S4	Our management believes that any liability imposed on us that may result from disposition of these lawsuits will not have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
1138118_11_ITEM2_P4_S0	We have concluded our previously disclosed internal investigation relating to activities by some of our employees in certain of our offices in China that raised issues with respect to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
1138118_11_ITEM2_P4_S1	The U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have also closed their review of such matters without any action.

1138118_11_ITEM5_P1_S1	As of February 11, 2011, there were 335 stockholders of record of our Class A common stock.
1138118_11_ITEM5_P1_S2	We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on any class of our common stock since our inception on February 20, 2001, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.
1138118_11_ITEM5_P1_S3	We currently intend to retain any future earnings to reduce debt and finance future growth.
1138118_11_ITEM5_P1_S4	Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors that the board of directors deems relevant.
1138118_11_ITEM5_P1_S5	In addition, our ability to declare and pay cash dividends is restricted by the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility and senior secured term loan facilities.

1138118_11_ITEM5_P5_S1	Includes 1,964,611 restricted stock units, the majority of which vest in 2015 and 2016 and are exercisable for no consideration.
1138118_11_ITEM5_P5_S2	Excluding these restricted stock units, the weighted average exercise price of outstanding options, warrants and rights increases to $7.55.
1138118_11_ITEM5_P6_S0	(2) Under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, we may issue stock awards, including but not limited to restricted stock bonuses and restricted stock units, as those terms are defined in the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan.
1138118_11_ITEM5_P6_S1	For awards granted prior to June 2, 2008 under this plan, each stock award other than a stock option or stock appreciation right, reduced the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan by 2.25.
1138118_11_ITEM5_P6_S2	For awards granted on or after June 2, 2008 under this plan, this share reserve is reduced by one share upon grant of each award.

1138118_11_ITEM6_P4_S0	(3) On April 28, 2006, our board of directors approved a three-for-one stock split of our Class A common stock effected as a 100% stock dividend, which was distributed on June 1, 2006.
1138118_11_ITEM6_P4_S1	The applicable share and per share data for all periods presented has been restated to give effect to this stock split.
1138118_11_ITEM6_P5_S0	EBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and goodwill and other non-amortizable intangible asset impairment.
1138118_11_ITEM6_P5_S1	Our management believes EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions.
1138118_11_ITEM6_P5_S2	Such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.
1138118_11_ITEM6_P5_S3	As a result, our management uses EBITDA as a measure to evaluate the operating performance of our various business segments and for other discretionary purposes, including as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive programs.
1138118_11_ITEM6_P5_S4	Additionally, we believe EBITDA is useful to investors to assist them in getting a more accurate picture of our results from operations.
1138118_11_ITEM6_P5_S5	However, EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and when analyzing our operating performance, readers should use EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP.
1138118_11_ITEM6_P5_S6	Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
1138118_11_ITEM6_P5_S7	Furthermore, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management s discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.
1138118_11_ITEM6_P5_S8	The amounts shown for EBITDA also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
1138118_11_ITEM6_P6_S0	EBITDA is calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_11_ITEM6_P7_S0	(5) Notes payable on real estate disclosed here includes the current and long-term portions of notes payable on real estate as well as notes payable included in liabilities related to real estate and other assets held for sale.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	We are the world s largest commercial real estate services firm, based on 2010 revenue, with leading full-service operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P0_S1	We offer a full range of services to occupiers, owners, lenders and investors in office, retail, industrial, multi-family and other types of commercial real estate.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P0_S2	As of December 31, 2010, we operated more than 300 offices worldwide, excluding affiliate offices, with approximately 31,000 employees providing commercial real estate services under the CB Richard Ellis and CBRE brand names and development services under the Trammell Crow brand name.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P0_S3	Our business is focused on several competencies, including commercial property and corporate facilities management, tenant representation, property/agency leasing, property sales, valuation, real estate investment management, commercial mortgage origination and servicing, capital markets (equity and debt) solutions, development services and proprietary research.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P0_S4	We generate revenues from contractual management fees and on a per project or transactional basis.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P0_S5	Since 2006, we have been the only commercial real estate services company included in the S P 500.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P0_S6	In every year since 2008, we have been the only commercial real estate services firm to be included in the Fortune 500 .
1138118_11_ITEM7_P0_S7	Additionally, the International Association of Outsourcing Professionals has included us among the top 100 global outsourcing companies across all industries for four consecutive years, including in 2010 when we ranked 13th overall.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P0_S8	In 2010, we were named the premier real estate services provider globally by a number of institutions, including The Financial Times , Euromoney and the International Property Awards, sponsored by Bloomberg.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	When you read our financial statements and the information included in this section, you should consider that we have experienced, and continue to experience, several material trends and uncertainties that have affected our financial condition and results of operations that make it challenging to predict our future performance based on our historical results.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	We believe that the following material trends and uncertainties are crucial to an understanding of the variability in our historical earnings and cash flows and the potential for continued variability in the future: Macroeconomic Conditions Economic trends and government policies affect global and regional commercial real estate markets as well as our operations directly.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P1_S2	These include: overall economic activity and employment growth, interest rate levels, the cost and availability of credit and the impact of tax and regulatory policies.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P1_S3	Periods of economic weakness or recession, significantly rising interest rates, declining employment levels, declining demand for real estate, declining real estate values, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, will negatively affect the performance of our business lines.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P1_S4	From late 2007 through 2009, the severe global economic downturn and credit market crisis had significant adverse effects on our operations by depressing transaction activity, decreasing occupancy and rental rates, sharply lowering property values and restraining corporate spending.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P1_S5	These trends, in turn, adversely affected revenue from property management fees and commissions derived from property sales, leasing, valuation and financing, and funds available to invest in commercial real estate and related assets.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P1_S6	These negative trends began to reverse in 2010 as commercial real estate markets improved in step with the stabilization and recovery of global economic activity.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P1_S7	Weak economic conditions in the late 2007 through 2009 period also affected our compensation expense, which is generally structured to decrease in line with a fall in revenue.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P1_S8	Compensation is our largest expense and the sales and leasing professionals in our largest line of business, advisory services, generally are paid on a commission and bonus basis that correlates with our revenue performance.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P1_S9	As a result, the negative effect of difficult market conditions on our operating margins was partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P1_S10	In addition, at times when negative economic conditions are particularly severe, as they were in 2008 and 2009, our management takes decisive actions to improve operational performance by, among other things, reducing discretionary bonuses, curtailing capital expenditures and adjusting overall staffing levels.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	Notwithstanding the recovery in 2010, a return of adverse global and regional economic trends remains one of the most significant risks to the financial condition and performance of our operations.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	Economic conditions first began to negatively affect our performance in the Americas, our largest segment in terms of revenue, beginning in the third quarter of 2007, and the decline in U.S. economic activity accelerated throughout 2008 and most of 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	The economic weakness became most severe following the global capital markets disruption in late 2008, which caused a significant and prolonged decline in property sales, leasing, financing and investment activity that adversely affected all our business lines.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	Commercial real estate fundamentals began to stabilize in early 2010 and to improve in the second half of 2010 following a return to positive economic growth in the United States in late 2009 and 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	The 2010 recovery was characterized by slowly decreasing vacancy rates, stabilizing rental rates, a broadening of credit availability and increasing property sales and leasing activity.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P4_S2	These recovery trends appeared to gain momentum in the last quarter of 2010, but market activity generally remained well below levels experienced in 2006 and 2007.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	In Europe, weakening market conditions first began to manifest in the United Kingdom in late 2007 and throughout the continent in early 2008.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	The major European economies also entered into a recession in 2008, which deepened and persisted through 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P5_S2	Economic growth improved in 2010, but remained behind other parts of the world.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P5_S3	As a result, leasing activity in 2010 was subdued, albeit stronger than in 2009, when activity was depressed.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	Investment sales in Europe were adversely affected by the financial crisis in late 2008 and most of 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	However, larger markets like London and Paris began to show modest increases in investment sales beginning in late 2009 and continuing in 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P6_S2	The recovery of sales activity also began to spread to more markets across Europe during the course of 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	Real estate markets in Asia Pacific were also affected, though generally to a lesser degree than in the United States and Europe, by the global credit market dislocation and economic downturn.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	This resulted in lower investment sales and leasing activity in 2008 and most of 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P7_S2	Transaction activity revived significantly in late 2009 and in 2010, and reflected strong economic growth in countries such as Australia, China, India and Singapore.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P7_S3	Deteriorating conditions also adversely affected investment management and development activity beginning in late 2007 as property values declined sharply, and both financing and disposal options became more limited.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P7_S4	However, the financing and disposal markets began to improve in 2010 with the pace of recovery picking up in the second half of the year.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P7_S5	The continuation and strengthening of the recovery of our global sales, leasing, investment management and development services operations depends on more vigorous economic growth and higher aggregate employment in major countries, especially the United States; continued improvement in the credit markets; and a continued rebound of business and consumer sentiment.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P7_S6	Effects of Acquisitions Our management historically has made significant use of strategic acquisitions to add new service competencies, to increase our scale within existing competencies and to expand our presence in various geographic regions around the world.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P7_S7	In December 2006, we acquired the Trammell Crow Company (the Trammell Crow Company Acquisition), our largest acquisition to date, which deepened our outsourcing services offerings for corporate and institutional clients, especially project and facilities management, strengthened our ability to provide integrated management solutions across geographies, and established resources and expertise to offer real estate development services throughout the United States.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	On February 15, 2011, we announced that we had entered into definitive agreements to acquire the majority of the real estate investment management business of Netherlands-based ING Group N.V. (ING) for approximately $940 million in cash.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	The acquisitions include substantially all of the ING Real Estate Investment Management operations in Europe and Asia, as well as Clarion Real Estate Securities (CRES), its U.S.-based global real estate listed securities business (collectively, ING REIM).
1138118_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	operated business segment upon completion of the acquisitions.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	CBRE Investors has primarily focused on value-add funds and separate accounts.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	ING REIM has primarily focused on core funds and global listed real estate securities funds, except in Asia, where ING REIM manages value-add funds and opportunity funds.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P10_S2	There is expected to be little overlap in the companies client bases, with a majority of CBRE Investors clients being U.S.-based and a majority of ING REIM s clients based in Europe.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P10_S3	We also expect to acquire approximately $55 million of CRES co-investments from ING and potentially additional interests in other funds managed by ING REIM Europe and ING REIM Asia.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P10_S4	In addition, we expect to incur transaction costs relating to the acquisitions of approximately $150 million (pre-tax), including financing, retention and integration costs.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P10_S5	These acquisitions, which we refer to as the REIM Acquisitions, are expected to close in the second half of 2011 and are subject to approval by certain stakeholders, including regulatory agencies in the United States, Europe and Asia.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the assets under management, or AUM, in the ING REIM portfolio we are acquiring totaled approximately $59.8 billion.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	CBRE Investors assets under management totaled $37.6 billion as of December 31, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	ING REIM, when combined with our existing Global Investment Management operations, will provide us with a significantly enhanced ability to meet the needs of institutional investors across global markets with a full spectrum of investment programs and strategies.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	AUM generally refers to the properties and other assets with respect to which we provide (or participate in) oversight, investment management services and other advice, and which generally consist of real estate properties or loans, securities portfolios and investments in operating companies and joint ventures.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	Our AUM is intended principally to reflect the extent of our presence in the real estate market, not the basis for determining our management fees.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P13_S2	Our material assets under management consist of:
1138118_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	a) the total fair market value of the real estate properties and other assets either wholly-owned or held by joint ventures and other entities in which our sponsored funds or investment vehicles and client accounts have invested or to which they have provided financing.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	Committed (but unfunded) capital from investors in our sponsored funds is not included in this component of our AUM.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P14_S2	The value of development properties is included at estimated completion cost.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	b) the net asset value of our managed securities portfolios, including investments (which may be comprised of committed but uncalled capital) in private real estate funds under our fund of funds program.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	Our calculation of AUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers (including ING REIM, as described below), and as a result this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	Our definition of AUM is not based on any definition of assets under management that is set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds that we manage.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	The methodologies used by the ING REIM business units and CBRE Investors to determine their respective AUM are not the same and, accordingly, the reported AUM of ING REIM would be different if calculated using a methodology consistent with that of CBRE Investors methodology.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P16_S2	To the extent applicable, ING REIM s reported AUM was converted from Euros to U.S. dollars using an exchange rate of $1.3379 per 1.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P16_S3	Strategic in-fill acquisitions have also played a key role in expanding our geographic coverage and broadening and strengthening our service offerings.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P16_S4	From 2005 to 2008, we completed 58 in-fill acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $592 million.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P16_S5	In light of the recent economic environment, no acquisitions were completed in 2009 and 2010, with the exception of a small niche industrial practice in the United Kingdom that we acquired in the second quarter of 2010 and a small commercial property asset management and consultancy services firm in Hong Kong that we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P16_S6	The companies we acquired have generally been quality regional firms or niche specialty firms that complement our existing platform within a region, or affiliates in which, in some cases, we held an equity interest.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P16_S7	As market conditions continue to improve, we believe acquisitions will once again serve as a growth engine, supplementing our organic growth.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	Although our management believes that strategic acquisitions can significantly decrease the cost, time and commitment of management resources necessary to attain a meaningful competitive position within targeted markets or to expand our presence within our current markets, our management also believes that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating and net income, both as a result of transaction-related expenditures, which include severance, lease termination, transaction, deferred financing and merger-related costs, among others, and the charges and costs of integrating the acquired business and its financial and accounting systems into our own.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	For example, we incurred $196.6 million of transaction-related expenditures in connection with our acquisition of Trammell Crow Company in 2006 and $3.5 million of transaction-related expenditures in connection with the expected REIM Acquisitions through December 31, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P17_S2	In addition, through December 31, 2010, we have incurred expenses of $62.3 million related to Trammell Crow Company in connection with the integration of its business lines, as well as accounting and other systems, into our own.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P17_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred $3.8 million of integration expenses, most of which were related to the acquisition of Trammell Crow Company.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P17_S4	As with prior material transactions, we expect to incur significant integration expenses associated with the expected REIM Acquisitions in 2011 and beyond.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P17_S5	International Operations We have made significant acquisitions of non-U.S. companies and we may acquire additional international companies in the future.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P17_S6	As we increase our international operations through either acquisitions or organic growth, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P17_S7	Our management team generally seeks to mitigate our exposure by balancing assets and liabilities that are denominated in the same currency and by maintaining cash positions outside the United States only at levels necessary for operating purposes.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P17_S8	In addition, from time to time we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate changes related to particular transactions and to hedge risks associated with the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	Due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P18_S1	In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P18_S2	Our international operations also are subject to, among other things, political instability and changing regulatory environments, which may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P18_S3	Our management routinely monitors these risks and related costs and evaluates the appropriate amount of resources to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P18_S4	We are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P18_S5	As of December 31, 2010, our total debt, excluding our notes payable on real estate and warehouse lines of credit (both of which are generally nonrecourse to us), was approximately $1.4 billion.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P18_S6	In connection with the REIM Acquisitions, we also expect to incur approximately $800 million of new term loans under our secured credit agreement to finance such acquisitions.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P18_S7	Our level of indebtedness and the operating and financial restrictions in our debt agreements place constraints on the operation of our business.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P18_S8	Although our management believes that the incurrence of long-term indebtedness has been important in the development of our business, including facilitating our acquisition of Trammell Crow Company, the cash flow necessary to service this debt is not available for other general corporate purposes, which may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in the commercial real estate services industry.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P18_S9	Our management seeks to mitigate this exposure both through the refinancing of debt when available on attractive terms and through selective repayment and retirement of indebtedness.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P18_S10	For example, on October 8, 2010, CB Richard Ellis Services, Inc., or CBRE, our wholly-owned subsidiary, issued $350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.625% senior notes due October 15, 2020.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P18_S11	Shortly thereafter, we repaid approximately $357.4 million of various tranches of our term A loans under our previous credit agreement using net proceeds from the new $350.0 million senior notes as well as cash on hand.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	addition, on November 10, 2010, we entered into a new credit agreement that provided for the refinancing of $650.0 million in senior secured term loans, established a new $700.0 million revolving credit facility with an extended maturity date to 2015 and included an accordion provision, which provides the ability to borrow an additional $800.0 million, which can be further expanded, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	All of these actions give us increased flexibility and have significantly extended the weighted average maturity of our outstanding debt.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that management believes to be reasonable.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P20_S2	Actual results may differ from those estimates.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P20_S3	We believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
1138118_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	Revenue Recognition In order for us to recognize revenue, there are four basic criteria that must be met:
1138118_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	Our revenue recognition policies are consistent with these criteria.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	The judgments involved in revenue recognition include understanding the complex terms of agreements and determining the appropriate time to recognize revenue for each transaction based on such terms.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	Each transaction is evaluated to determine: (i) at what point in time revenue is earned, (ii) whether contingencies exist that impact the timing of recognition of revenue and (iii) how and when such contingencies will be resolved.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P23_S2	The timing of revenue recognition could vary if different judgments were made.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P23_S3	Our revenues subject to the most judgment are brokerage commission revenue and incentive-based management and development fees.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P23_S4	We record commission revenue on real estate sales generally upon close of escrow or transfer of title, except when future contingencies exist.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P23_S5	Real estate commissions on leases are generally recorded in revenue when all obligations under the commission agreement are satisfied.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	Terms and conditions of a commission agreement may include, but are not limited to, execution of a signed lease agreement and future contingencies including tenant occupancy, payment of a deposit or payment of a first month s rent (or a combination thereof).
1138118_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	As some of these conditions are outside of our control and are often not clearly defined, judgment must be exercised in determining when such required events have occurred in order to recognize revenue.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	A typical commission agreement provides that we earn a portion of a lease commission upon the execution of the lease agreement by the tenant and landlord, with the remaining portion(s) of the lease commission earned at a later date, usually upon tenant occupancy or payment of rent.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	The existence of any significant future contingencies results in the delay of recognition of corresponding revenue until such contingencies are satisfied.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P25_S2	For example, if we do not earn all or a portion of the lease commission until the tenant pays its first month s rent, and the lease agreement provides the tenant with a free rent period, we delay revenue recognition until rent is paid by the tenant.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	Property management revenues are generally based upon percentages of the revenue or base rent generated by the entities managed or the square footage managed.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	These fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related management agreements.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	Investment management fees are based predominantly upon a percentage of the equity deployed on behalf of our limited partners.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	Fees related to our indirect investment management programs are based upon a percentage of the fair value of those investments.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P27_S2	These fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related investment management agreements.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P27_S3	Our Global Investment Management segment also earns performance-based incentive fees with regard to many of its investments.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P27_S4	Such revenue is recognized at the end of the measurement periods when the conditions of the applicable incentive fee arrangements have been satisfied and following the expiration of any potential claw back provision.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P27_S5	With many of these investments, our Global Investment Management team has participation interests in such incentive fees, which are commonly referred to as carried interest.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P27_S6	This carried interest expense is generally accrued for based upon the probability of such performance-based incentive fees being earned over the related vesting period.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P27_S7	In addition, our Global Investment Management segment also earns success-based transaction fees with regard to buying or selling properties on certain funds and separate accounts.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P27_S8	Such revenue is recognized at the completion of a successful transaction and is not subject to any claw back provision.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	We earn incentive development fees in our Development Services segment.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	These fees are recognized when quantitative criteria have been met (such as specified leasing or budget targets) or, for those incentive fees based on qualitative criteria, upon approval of the fee by our clients.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	Certain incentive development fees allow us to share in the fair value of the developed real estate asset above cost.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	This sharing creates additional revenue potential to us with no exposure to loss other than opportunity cost.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P29_S2	Our incentive development fee revenue is not recognized to the extent that such revenue is subject to future performance contingencies, but rather once the contingency has been resolved.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P29_S3	The unique nature and complexity of each incentive fee requires us to use varying levels of judgment in determining the timing of revenue recognition.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	In establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables, we make assumptions with respect to future collectability.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	Our assumptions are based on an assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends, including the aging of receivables balances.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P30_S2	In addition to these assessments, in general, outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are more than 180 days overdue are evaluated for collectability and fully provided for if deemed uncollectible.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	Historically, our credit losses have generally been insignificant.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	However, estimating losses requires significant judgment, and conditions may change or new information may become known after any periodic evaluation.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P31_S2	As a result, actual credit losses may differ from our estimates.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P31_S3	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majority-owned subsidiaries, as well as variable interest entities, or VIEs, in which we are the primary beneficiary.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P31_S4	The equity attributable to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries is shown separately in our consolidated balance sheets included elsewhere in this filing.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P31_S5	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	Our determination of the appropriate accounting method with respect to our VIEs, including co-investments with our clients, is based on Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2009-17, Consolidations (Topic 810): Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities .
1138118_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) , issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, in June 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P32_S2	The amendments in this ASU replace the quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation for determining which reporting entity, if any, has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with a primarily qualitative approach focused on identifying which reporting entity has both (1) the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact such entity s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from such entity that could potentially be significant to such entity.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P32_S3	The entity which satisfies these criteria is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	We determine if an entity is a VIE based on several factors, including whether the entity s total equity investment at risk upon inception is sufficient to finance the entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	We make judgments regarding the sufficiency of the equity at risk based first on a qualitative analysis, then a quantitative analysis, if necessary.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	We analyze any investments in VIEs to determine if we are the primary beneficiary.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	We consider a variety of factors in identifying the entity that holds the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance including, but not limited to, the ability to direct financing, leasing, construction and other operating decisions and activities.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P34_S2	In addition, we also consider the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions, to replace the manager and to sell or liquidate the entity.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P34_S3	We also have several co-investments in real estate investment funds which qualify for a deferral of the newer qualitative approach for analyzing potential VIEs.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P34_S4	We continue to analyze these investments under the former quantitative method incorporating various estimates, including estimated future cash flows, asset hold periods and discount rates, as well as estimates of the probabilities of various scenarios occurring.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	If the entity is a VIE, we then determine whether we consolidate the entity as the primary beneficiary.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P35_S1	This determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary includes any impact of an upside economic interest in the form of a promote that we may have.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	A promote is an interest built into the distribution structure of the entity based on the entity s achievement of certain return hurdles.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	We consolidate any VIE of which we are the primary beneficiary (see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and disclose significant VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary, if any.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P37_S1	We determine whether an entity is a VIE and, if so, whether it should be consolidated by utilizing judgments and estimates that are inherently subjective.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P37_S2	If we made different judgments or utilized different estimates in these evaluations, it could result in differing conclusions as to whether or not an entity is a VIE and whether or not to consolidate such entity.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P37_S3	If an entity is not a VIE, our determination of the appropriate accounting method with respect to our investments in limited partnerships, limited liability companies and other subsidiaries is based on voting control.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P37_S4	For our general partner interests, we are presumed to control (and therefore consolidate) the entity, unless the other limited partners have substantive rights that overcome this presumption of control.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P37_S5	These substantive rights allow the limited partners to participate in significant decisions made in the ordinary course of the entity s business.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P37_S6	We account for our non-controlling general partner investments in these entities under the equity method.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P37_S7	This treatment also applies to our managing member interests in limited liability companies.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P37_S8	Our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, but do not control, or entities which are variable interest entities in which we are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for under the equity method.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P37_S9	Accordingly, our share of the earnings from these equity-method basis companies is included in consolidated net income.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P37_S10	All other investments held on a long-term basis are valued at cost less any impairment in value.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	Our determination of the appropriate accounting treatment for an investment in a subsidiary requires judgment of several factors, including the size and nature of our ownership interest and the other owners substantive rights to make decisions for the entity.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P38_S1	If we were to make different judgments or conclusions as to the level of our control or influence, it could result in a different accounting treatment.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P38_S2	Accounting for an investment as either consolidated or using the equity method generally would have no impact on our net income or stockholders equity in any accounting period, but a different treatment would impact individual income statement and balance sheet items, as consolidation would effectively gross up our income statement and balance sheet.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P38_S3	If our evaluation of an investment accounted for using the cost method was different, it could result in our being required to account for an investment by consolidation or by the equity method.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	cost method, the investor only records its share of the underlying entity s earnings to the extent that it receives dividends from the investee; when the dividends received by the investor exceed the investor s share of the investee s earnings subsequent to the date of the investor s investment, the investor records a reduction in the basis of its investment.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	Under the cost method, the investor does not record its share of losses of the investee.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P39_S2	Conversely, under either consolidation or equity method accounting, the investor effectively records its share of the underlying entity s net income or loss, or its guarantees of the underlying entity s debt.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P39_S3	Under either the equity or cost method, impairment losses are recognized upon evidence of other-than-temporary losses of value.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	When testing for impairment on investments that are not actively traded on a public market, we generally use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our investments and/or look to comparable activities in the marketplace.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P40_S1	Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow approach.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P40_S2	These assumptions include net asset values, internal rates of return, discount and capitalization rates, interest rates and financing terms, rental rates, timing of leasing activity, estimates of lease terms and related concessions, etc.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P40_S3	When determining if impairment is other-than-temporary, we also look to the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been less than cost as well as the financial condition and near-term prospects of each investment.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting, which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	In determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, we use a variety of valuation methods including present value, depreciated replacement cost, market values (where available) and selling prices less costs to dispose.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	We are responsible for determining the valuation of assets and liabilities and for the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	Assumptions must often be made in determining fair values, particularly where observable market values do not exist.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	Assumptions may include discount rates, growth rates, cost of capital, royalty rates, tax rates and remaining useful lives.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P44_S2	These assumptions can have a significant impact on the value of identifiable assets and accordingly can impact the value of goodwill recorded.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P44_S3	Different assumptions could result in different values being attributed to assets and liabilities.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P44_S4	Since these values impact the amount of annual depreciation and amortization expense, different assumptions could also impact our statement of operations and could impact the results of future impairment reviews.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	The majority of our goodwill balance has resulted from our acquisition of CBRE, in 2001, our acquisition of Insignia Financial Group, Inc., or Insignia, in 2003 (the Insignia Acquisition) and from the Trammell Crow Company Acquisition.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P45_S1	Other intangible assets include a trademark, which was separately identified as a result of the 2001 acquisition, as well as a trade name separately identified as a result of the Insignia Acquisition representing the Richard Ellis trade name in the United Kingdom that was owned by Insignia prior to the Insignia Acquisition.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P45_S2	Both the trademark and the trade name are not being amortized and have indefinite estimated useful lives.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P45_S3	The remaining other intangible assets primarily include customer relationships, management contracts, loan servicing rights and transition costs, which are all being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging up to 20 years.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P45_S4	We are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	The goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step process.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	The first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P47_S1	We use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P47_S2	Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P47_S3	These assumptions include revenue growth rates, profit margin percentages, discount rates, etc.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	its carrying value, goodwill is considered to not be impaired.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	The second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	The implied fair value of goodwill is determined similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination, by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one, over the estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P49_S2	Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business s fair value and the relative size of our goodwill, if different assumptions and estimates were used, it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	Our annual assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives has historically been completed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P50_S1	We performed the 2010, 2009, and 2008 annual assessments as of October 1.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P50_S2	However, we were required to re-perform the 2008 assessment as of December 31, 2008 because economic conditions worsened, the capital markets became distressed and our stock price dropped significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P50_S3	This was evidenced in our 2008 results by weak sales and leasing activity in our Americas and EMEA segments caused by the credit crunch and significant capital market turmoil, which adversely affected incentive-based revenue within our Global Investment Management segment as well as reduced real estate sales volume and values in our Development Services segment.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P50_S4	Based on our assessments of goodwill in 2008, we determined that we had impairment in several reporting units, which was driven by these adverse economic conditions causing a decline in the estimated future discounted cash flows expected for such units.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P50_S5	The amount of the pre-tax goodwill impairment charges included in our statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $1.1 billion.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P50_S6	We also determined that two of our intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, $84.0 million representing the Trammell Crow trade name identified in the Trammell Crow Company Acquisition and $6.9 million representing the CBRE Melody trademark identified as a result of the 2001 acquisition, were also fully impaired.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P50_S7	The impairment of the Trammell Crow trade name was driven by the adverse economic conditions causing a significant decline in the estimated future discounted cash flows of the Development Services segment such that we could not substantiate this trade name having any book value.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P50_S8	The impairment of the CBRE Melody trademark was driven by our mortgage brokerage business s plans to discontinue use of the Melody trademark and exclusively use the CBRE trademark.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P50_S9	The amount of the pre-tax other non-amortizable intangible asset impairment charges included in our statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $90.9 million.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P50_S10	When we performed our required annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2010 and 2009, we determined that no impairment existed as the estimated fair value of our reporting units was in excess of their carrying value.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P50_S11	Although economic conditions remained weak for most of 2009 and our full year revenues for 2009 declined when compared to 2008, we did note early signs of an economic recovery taking place in the latter part of 2009, which continued throughout 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P50_S12	This was evidenced by several indicators, including our stock price ($18.13 per share on October 1, 2010 and $10.94 per share on October 1, 2009 versus $4.32 per share at December 31, 2008), a return to positive economic growth in the United States in the second half of 2009 and an economic rebound in the Asia Pacific region with transaction activity beginning to revive in late 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P50_S13	These indicators, as well as the benefit of cost reduction measures implemented in the second half of 2008 and in 2009, led to a significant increase in the estimated fair value of the Company s reporting units as of October 1, 2010 and 2009 as compared to the estimated fair value at December 31, 2008.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P50_S14	In addition, the overall size of our goodwill and other non-amortizable assets being tested were sharply reduced as a result of the $1.2 billion impairment charge recorded during the year ended December 31, 2008.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P50_S15	This impairment charge included the write-off of goodwill in its entirety in two reporting units that were most severely impacted by the weak economic conditions at that time (i.e. Global Investment Management and Development Services).
1138118_11_ITEM7_P50_S16	If we experience a significant or sustained decline in our future cash flows and/or if the current economic conditions significantly worsen, we may need to perform additional impairment analysis in the future.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	Real Estate As of December 31, 2010, the carrying value of our total real estate assets was $754.6 million (14.7% of total assets).
1138118_11_ITEM7_P51_S1	The significant accounting policies and estimates with regard to our real estate assets relate to classification and impairment evaluation, cost capitalization and allocation, disposition of real estate and discontinued operations.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P51_S2	Classification and Impairment Evaluation With respect to our real estate assets, the Property, Plant and Equipment, Topic of FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, or Topic 360, establishes criteria to classify an asset as held for sale.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P51_S3	Assets included in real estate held for sale include only completed assets or land for sale in its present condition that meet all of Topic 360 s held for sale criteria.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P51_S4	All other real estate assets are classified in one of the following line items in our consolidated balance sheet: (i) real estate under development (current), which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of within one year of the balance sheet date; (ii) real estate under development (non-current), which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of more than one year from the balance sheet date; or (iii) real estate held for investment, which consists of land on which development activities have not yet commenced and completed assets or land held for disposition that do not meet the held for sale criteria.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	Real estate held for sale is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less cost to sell.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P52_S1	If an asset s fair value less cost to sell, based on discounted future cash flows, management estimates or market comparisons, is less than its carrying amount, an allowance is recorded against the asset.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P52_S2	Determining an asset s fair value and the related allowance to record requires us to utilize judgment and estimates.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	Real estate under development and real estate held for investment are carried at cost less depreciation, as applicable.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	Buildings and improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, generally up to 39 years.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P53_S2	Tenant improvements included in real estate held for investment are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the terms of the respective leases.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P53_S3	Land improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, up to 15 years.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P53_S4	When indicators of impairment are present, real estate under development and real estate held for investment are evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset or market comparisons are less than the asset s carrying amount.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P53_S5	The amount of the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value, which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, management estimates or market comparisons.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P53_S6	Impairment charges of $24.6 million, $28.8 million and $48.7 million were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P53_S7	In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we also recorded provisions for loss on real estate held for sale of $2.3 million and $3.9 million, respectively.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	We evaluate each of our real estate assets on a quarterly basis in order to determine the classification of each asset in our consolidated balance sheet.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P54_S1	This evaluation requires judgment by us in considering certain criteria that must be evaluated under Topic 360, such as the estimated time to complete assets that are under development and the timeframe in which we expect to sell our real estate assets.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	The classification of real estate assets determines which real estate assets are to be depreciated as well as what method is used to evaluate and measure impairment.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	Had we evaluated our assets differently, the balance sheet classification of such assets, depreciation expense and impairment losses could have been different.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	Cost Capitalization and Allocation When acquiring, developing and constructing real estate assets, we capitalize costs.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	complete and the asset is available for occupancy, which are timing decisions that require judgment.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P57_S1	Costs capitalized include pursuit costs, or pre-acquisition/pre-construction costs, taxes and insurance, interest, development and construction costs and costs of incidental operations.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	We expense transaction costs for acquisitions that qualify as a business in accordance with the Business Combinations Topic of the FASB ASC, or Topic 805.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	Pursuit costs capitalized in connection with a potential development project that we have determined based on our judgment not to pursue are written off in the period that such determination is made.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P58_S2	A difference in the timing of when this determination is made could cause the pursuit costs to be expensed in a different period.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	At times, we purchase bulk land that we intend to sell or develop in phases.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P59_S1	The land basis allocated to each phase is based on the relative estimated fair value of the phases before construction.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P59_S2	We allocate construction costs incurred relating to more than one phase between the various phases; if the costs cannot be specifically attributed to a certain phase or the improvements benefit more than one phase, we allocate the costs between the phases based on their relative estimated sales values, where practicable, or other value methods as appropriate under the circumstances.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P59_S3	Relative allocations of the costs are revised as the sales value estimates are revised.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	When acquiring real estate with existing buildings, we allocate the purchase price between land, land improvements, building and intangibles related to in-place leases, if any, based on their relative fair values.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P60_S1	The fair values of acquired land and buildings are determined based on an estimated discounted future cash flow model with lease-up assumptions as if the building was vacant upon acquisition.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P60_S2	The fair value of in-place leases includes the value of lease intangibles for above or below-market rents and tenant origination costs, determined on a lease by lease basis using assumptions for market rates, absorption periods, lease commissions and tenant improvements.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P60_S3	The capitalized values for both lease intangibles and tenant origination costs are amortized over the term of the underlying leases.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P60_S4	Amortization related to lease intangibles is recorded as either an increase to or a reduction of rental income and amortization for tenant origination costs is recorded to amortization expense.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P60_S5	If we use different estimates in these valuations, the allocation of purchase price to each component could differ, which could cause the amount of amortization related to lease intangibles and tenant origination costs to be different, as well as depreciation of the related building and land improvements.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	Disposition of Real Estate Gains on disposition of real estate are recognized upon sale of the underlying project.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P61_S1	We evaluate each real estate sale transaction to determine if it qualifies for gain recognition under the full accrual method.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P61_S2	This evaluation requires us to make judgments and estimates in assessing whether a sale has been consummated, the adequacy of the buyer s investment, the subordination or collectability of any receivable related to the purchase, and whether we have transferred the usual risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer, with no substantial continuing involvement by us.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P61_S3	If the transaction does not meet the criteria for the full accrual method of profit recognition based on our assessment, we account for the sale based on an appropriate deferral method determined by the nature and extent of the buyer s investment and our continuing involvement.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P61_S4	In some cases, a deferral method could require the real estate asset and its related liabilities to remain on our balance sheet until the sale qualifies for a different deferral method or full accrual profit recognition.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	Discontinued Operations Topic 360 extends the reporting of a discontinued operation to a component of an entity, and further requires that a component be classified as a discontinued operation if the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	As defined in Topic 360, a component of an entity comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the rest of the entity.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	The evaluation of whether the component s cash flows have been eliminated and the level of our continuing involvement require judgment by us and a different assessment could result in items not being reported as discontinued operations.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with the Accounting for Income Taxes , Topic of the FASB ASC, or Topic 740.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P66_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P66_S2	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	Accounting for tax positions requires judgments, including estimating reserves for potential uncertainties.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P68_S1	We also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P68_S2	We do not record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that we believe will be realized in future periods.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P68_S3	While we believe the resulting tax balances as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with Topic 740, as applicable, the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P68_S4	See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	The following table sets forth items derived from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008:
1138118_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	EBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and goodwill and other non-amortizable intangible asset impairment.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P70_S1	Our management believes EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P70_S2	Such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P70_S3	As a result, our management uses EBITDA as a measure to evaluate the operating performance of our various business segments and for other discretionary purposes, including as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive programs.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P70_S4	Additionally, we believe EBITDA is useful to investors to assist them in getting a more accurate picture of our results from operations.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	However, EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and when analyzing our operating performance, readers should use EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P71_S1	Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P71_S2	Furthermore, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management s discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P71_S3	The amounts shown for EBITDA also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P71_S4	Amounts shown for EBITDA, as adjusted, remove the impact of certain cash and non-cash charges related to acquisitions, cost containment and asset impairments.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P71_S5	EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted for selected charges are calculated as follows:
1138118_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	(4) Includes interest income related to discontinued operations of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 We reported consolidated net income of $200.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 on revenue of $5.1 billion as compared to consolidated net income of $33.3 million on revenue of $4.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P73_S1	Our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by $949.5 million, or 22.8%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	worldwide sales (up 51.5%), leasing (up 29.3%) and outsourcing (up 8.5%) activity.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P74_S1	Foreign currency translation had a $44.1 million positive impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P74_S2	Our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by $512.3 million, or 20.9%, during the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P74_S3	Our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission and bonus basis, which substantially correlates with our revenue performance.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P74_S4	Accordingly, the increase in revenue led to a corresponding increase in commission and bonus accruals.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P74_S5	In addition, commission reinstatements contributed to the increase.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P74_S6	Higher salaries and related costs associated with our property and facilities management contracts also contributed to an increase in cost of services in the current year.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P74_S7	Foreign currency translation had a $31.0 million negative impact on cost of services during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P74_S8	Cost of services as a percentage of revenue decreased from 58.8% for the year ended December 31, 2009 to 57.9% for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P74_S9	This decrease was primarily the result of the strong improvement in overall revenue and a shift in the mix of revenue, with transaction revenue comprising a greater portion of the total than in the prior year.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P74_S10	Our operating, administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis increased by $224.1 million, or 16.2%, during the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P74_S11	The increase was primarily driven by higher payroll-related costs, including bonuses, which resulted from our improved operating performance as well as the restoration of salaries to pre-recession levels in the third quarter of 2010 and substantially restored bonus target levels in the fourth quarter of 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P74_S12	Also contributing to the increase was higher carried interest incentive compensation expense accruals and increased marketing and travel costs in support of our growing revenue in the current year.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P75_S0	Foreign currency translation had a $10.8 million negative impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P75_S1	Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 31.4% for the year ended December 31, 2010 from 33.2% for the year ended December 31, 2009, reflective of our cost containment efforts during the recessionary period of 2008 and 2009 as well as the strong improvement in overall revenue.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P75_S2	Our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by $8.9 million, or 9.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P75_S3	This increase was primarily attributable to higher depreciation expense within our Global Investment Management segment driven by the consolidation of several assets due to the adoption of ASU 2009-17 in the current year.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P75_S4	Our gain on disposition of real estate on a consolidated basis was $7.3 million and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P75_S5	These gains resulted from activity within our Development Services segment.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P75_S6	Our equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis was $26.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to an equity loss from unconsolidated subsidiaries of $34.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P75_S7	The increase in equity income in the current year was primarily driven by higher equity earnings associated with gains on property sales within our Development Services segment and higher equity earnings in our Global Investment Management segment largely resulting from a fund liquidation.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P75_S8	Also contributing to the variance were lower impairment charges associated with equity investments in our Development Services and Global Investment Management segments in the current year.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P75_S9	Our consolidated interest income was $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $2.3 million, or 37.3%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P75_S10	This increase was mainly driven by higher interest income reported in our Asia Pacific segment, which resulted from the final measurement of a deferred purchase obligation related to the purchase of remaining non-controlling interests in our subsidiary in India.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P75_S11	Our consolidated interest expense increased by $2.0 million, or 1.1%, during the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P76_S0	consolidation of several assets due to the adoption of ASU 2009-17 in the current year.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P76_S1	These increases were largely offset by lower interest expense associated with our credit agreement.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P76_S2	We wrote off $18.1 million and $29.3 million of financing costs during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P76_S3	In connection with the new credit agreement we entered into on November 10, 2010, we wrote off financing costs of $16.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P76_S4	In addition, in October 2010, we wrote off $1.4 million of unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with debt repayments made.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P76_S5	In connection with the March 24, 2009 amendment and restatement of our previous credit agreement, we wrote off financing costs of $29.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P76_S6	Our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was $130.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to $27.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P76_S7	Our effective tax rate from continuing operations, after adjusting pre-tax income (loss) to remove the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, decreased to 40.5% for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to 44.7% for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P76_S8	The changes in our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate were primarily the result of a significant increase in income reported in the current year as well as a change in our mix of domestic and foreign earnings (losses).
1138118_11_ITEM7_P76_S9	Our consolidated income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, was $14.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P76_S10	This income was reported in our Development Services segment and mostly related to gains from asset dispositions.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P76_S11	Our net loss attributable to non-controlling interests on a consolidated basis was $44.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to $61.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P76_S12	This activity primarily reflects our non-controlling interests share of losses within our Global Investment Management and Development Services segments.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P76_S13	Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 We reported consolidated net income of $33.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 on revenue of $4.2 billion as compared to a consolidated net loss of $1.0 billion on revenue of $5.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P76_S14	Our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by $963.0 million, or 18.8%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P76_S15	This decrease was primarily driven by weak worldwide sales and leasing activity as well as lower appraisal revenue, all resulting from the continuation of challenging global economic conditions.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P76_S16	While our outsourcing business continued to add new clients and expand existing relationships, its revenue also declined slightly in 2009 as a result of reduced client spending, a rise in vacancy rates of properties we manage as well as the effect of client consolidations and distress during 2008 and 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P76_S17	Foreign currency translation had a $129.2 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P76_S18	Our cost of services on a consolidated basis decreased by $478.8 million, or 16.4%, during the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P77_S0	As previously mentioned, our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission and bonus basis, which substantially correlates with our revenue performance.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P77_S1	Accordingly, the decrease in revenue led to a corresponding decrease in commissions and bonuses.

1138118_11_ITEM7_P77_S4	This increase was primarily driven by the large decrease in overall revenue and a shift in the mix of revenues with outsourcing, including reimbursables, comprising a materially greater portion of the total than in 2008.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P77_S5	Our operating, administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis decreased by $363.5 million, or 20.8%, during the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P78_S0	lower operating costs, particularly payroll-related, travel and marketing costs.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P78_S1	The decrease was also driven by reduced bonus expense resulting from lower business performance.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P78_S2	Foreign currency translation had a $40.9 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P78_S3	As a result of our aggressive cost cutting measures, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 33.2% for the year ended December 31, 2009 from 34.1% for the year ended December 31, 2008.

1138118_11_ITEM7_P78_S5	This decline was mainly driven by lower depreciation expense resulting from decreased capital expenditures.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P78_S6	Our goodwill and other non-amortizable intangible asset impairment on a consolidated basis was $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P78_S7	These impairment charges were primarily driven by adverse economic conditions causing a decline in the estimated future discounted cash flows for several of our reporting units.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P78_S8	Our gain on disposition of real estate on a consolidated basis was $7.0 million and $18.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P78_S9	These gains resulted from activity within our Development Services segment.

1138118_11_ITEM7_P78_S11	This decrease was primarily driven by lower non-cash write-downs resulting from declines in value of investments in our Development Services and Global Investment Management segments in 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P78_S12	Also contributing to this variance was a $14.7 million non-cash write-down of our investment in Realty Finance Corporation, a mortgage REIT, within our Americas segment attributable to a decline in its market valuation in 2008, which did not recur in 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P78_S13	Our consolidated interest income was $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $11.6 million, or 65.5%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P78_S14	This decrease was mainly driven by lower interest income earned in our Development Services segment due to a decrease in notes receivable in 2009 and in our Americas and EMEA segments as a result of lower interest rates in 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P78_S15	Our consolidated interest expense increased by $22.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, or 13.2%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P78_S16	The increase was primarily due to higher interest expense associated with the $450.0 million of 11.625% senior subordinated notes issued in June 2009, partially offset by lower interest expense associated with our previous credit agreement, mainly due to lower average outstanding debt balances in 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P78_S17	We wrote off $29.3 million of financing costs during the year ended December 31, 2009 in connection with the amendment of our previous credit agreement on March 24, 2009.

1138118_11_ITEM7_P78_S19	Our effective tax rate from continuing operations, after adjusting pre-tax loss to remove the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, increased to 44.7% for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to negative 5.2% for the year ended December 31, 2008.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P78_S20	The changes in our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate were primarily the result of a sizeable loss reported in 2008 versus income in 2009, a change in our mix of domestic and foreign earnings (losses) as well as a large portion of the goodwill impairment charges incurred in 2008 being non-deductible for U.S. income tax purposes.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P78_S21	Our consolidated income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, was $26.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.

1138118_11_ITEM7_P89_S12	Operating, administrative and other expenses decreased by $73.7 million, or 35.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P89_S13	The decrease was primarily driven by lower impairment charges related to real estate assets, which totaled $38.6 million and $59.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P89_S14	Also contributing to the decrease in 2009 were lower construction costs and a decrease in payroll-related costs, including bonuses, as a result of lower business performance in 2009 as well as cost containment efforts in 2008 through 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P89_S15	Development projects in process as of December 31, 2009 totaled $4.7 billion, down 16% from year-end 2008.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P89_S16	The inventory of pipeline deals as of December 31, 2009 stood at $0.9 billion, down 64% from year-end 2008 as a result of the weak market conditions.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P90_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that we can satisfy our working capital requirements and funding of investments with internally generated cash flow and, as necessary, borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P90_S1	Our expected capital requirements for 2011 include up to $100 million of anticipated net capital expenditures.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P90_S2	As of December 31, 2010, we had committed to fund $22.0 million of additional capital to unconsolidated subsidiaries within our Development Services business, which we may be required to fund at any time.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P91_S0	Management business, all of which is expected to be funded in 2011.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P92_S0	In recent years, the global credit markets have experienced unprecedented tightening, which could affect both the availability and cost of our funding sources in the future.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P93_S0	On February 15, 2011, we announced that we had entered into definitive agreements to acquire the majority of the real estate investment management business of Netherlands-based ING for approximately $940 million in cash.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P93_S1	The acquisitions include substantially all of the ING REIM operations in Europe and Asia, as well as CRES, its U.S.-based global real estate listed securities business.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P93_S2	We also expect to acquire approximately $55 million of CRES co-investments from ING and potentially additional interests in other funds managed by ING REIM Europe and ING REIM Asia.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P93_S3	In addition, we expect to incur transaction costs relating to the acquisitions of approximately $150 million (pre-tax), including financing, retention and integration costs.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P93_S4	The acquisitions are expected to close in the second half of 2011 and are subject to approval by certain stakeholders, including regulatory agencies in the United States, Europe and Asia.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P93_S5	We plan to finance the acquisitions with cash on hand and borrowings under our credit agreement.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P93_S6	During 2003 and 2006, we required substantial amounts of equity and debt financing to fund our acquisitions of Insignia and Trammell Crow Company.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P93_S7	In the past two years, we also conducted two debt offerings.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P93_S8	The first, in 2009, was part of a capital restructuring in response to the global economic recession, and the second, in 2010, was to take advantage of low interest rates and term availability.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P93_S9	Absent extraordinary transactions such as these and the equity offerings we completed during the unprecedented recent global capital markets disruption in 2008 and 2009, we historically have not sought external sources of financing and have relied on our internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital, capital expenditure and investment requirements.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P93_S10	In the absence of such extraordinary events, our management anticipates that our cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future, but at a minimum for the next 12 months.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P94_S0	As evidenced above, from time to time, we consider potential strategic acquisitions.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P94_S1	Our management believes that any future significant acquisitions that we make most likely would require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P94_S2	In the past, we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that our management believed to be reasonable.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P94_S3	However, it is possible that we may not be able to find acquisition financing on favorable terms in the future if we decide to make any further material acquisitions.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P95_S0	Our long-term liquidity needs, other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases, generally are comprised of three elements.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P96_S0	The first is the repayment of the outstanding and anticipated principal amounts of our long-term indebtedness.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P96_S1	Our management is unable to project with certainty whether our long-term cash flow from operations will be sufficient to repay our long-term debt when it comes due.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P96_S2	If this cash flow is insufficient, then our management expects that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P96_S3	Our management cannot make any assurances that such refinancings or amendments would be available on attractive terms, if at all.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P97_S0	The second long-term liquidity need is the repayment of obligations under our pension plans in the United Kingdom.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P97_S1	Our subsidiaries based in the United Kingdom maintain two contributory defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in the plans.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P97_S2	With respect to these plans, our historical policy has been to contribute annually, an amount to fund pension cost as actuarially determined and as required by applicable laws and regulations.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P97_S3	Our contributions to these plans are invested and, if these investments do not perform in the future as well as we expect, we will be required to provide additional funding to cover any shortfall.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P97_S4	During 2007, we reached agreements with the active members of these plans to freeze future pension plan benefits.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P97_S5	In return, the active members became eligible to enroll in the CBRE Group Personal Pension Plan, a defined contribution plan in the United Kingdom.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P97_S6	The underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans included in pension liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets was $40.0 million and $64.9 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P97_S7	We expect to contribute a total of $3.6 million to fund our pension plans for the year ending December 31, 2011.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P98_S0	The third long-term liquidity need is the repayment of obligations related to acquisitions.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P98_S1	For example, in connection with our acquisitions of CB Richard Ellis KK (Japan) in 2006 and CB Richard Ellis South Asia Pte Ltd (India) in 2007, we incurred obligations with respect to the future purchase of non-controlling interests in such entities.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P98_S2	As of December 31, 2009, we had $58.5 million of these deferred purchase obligations outstanding, which were included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P98_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2010, we purchased the remaining non-controlling interests in Japan and India.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P98_S4	As of December 31, 2010, there were no deferred purchase obligations outstanding.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P99_S0	On June 10, 2009, we completed the sale of 13,440,860 shares of our Class A common stock through a direct placement to Paulson Co. Inc., which raised approximately $97.6 million of net proceeds.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P99_S1	On June 11, 2009, we completed the sale of 5,682,684 shares of our Class A common stock through an at-the-market offering program, which raised approximately $48.8 million of net proceeds.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P99_S2	The net proceeds from these offerings were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of some of our outstanding indebtedness under our previous credit agreement.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P99_S3	In November 2009, we completed the sale of 28,289,960 shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to an at-the-market offering program, which raised approximately $293.8 million of net proceeds.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P99_S4	We used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of debt.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P99_S5	Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $616.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $402.9 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P99_S6	The increase was primarily due to improved operating performance, higher net payments to vendors and to employees under our deferred compensation plan in the prior year and an increase in commission, bonus and income tax accruals in the current year.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P99_S7	These items were partially offset by a greater increase in receivables and higher bonuses paid in the current year.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P99_S8	Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $213.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to net cash used in operating activities of $130.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P99_S9	The sharp increase in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2009 versus 2008 was primarily due to significantly lower bonus payments, income taxes and payments to vendors made in 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P99_S10	These decreases were partially offset by lower results in 2009 (excluding the impact of non-cash impairment charges) as well as the impact of a significant decrease in receivables in 2008 versus a slight increase in 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P100_S0	Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $62.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of $56.9 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P100_S1	The decrease was primarily driven by higher net proceeds received in the current year from the disposition of real estate held for investment and from the sale of servicing rights and other assets.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P100_S2	A decrease in restricted cash and lower contributions to investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries along with higher distributions received from investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in the current year also contributed to the decrease.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P100_S3	These decreases were partially offset by the use of more cash in the current year for capital expenditures and earn out payments associated with in-fill acquisitions.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P100_S4	Net cash used in investing activities totaled $119.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $299.6 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P100_S5	The decrease was primarily driven by the use of more cash in 2008 for in-fill acquisitions and purchases of real estate held for investment.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P101_S0	Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $784.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $476.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P101_S1	The sharp decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to higher net repayments of our senior secured term loans in the current year as well as proceeds received in the prior year in connection with equity offerings and the issuance of our 11.625% senior subordinated notes.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P101_S2	Also contributing to the decrease were higher net repayments of notes payable on real estate within our Development Services segment in the current year.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P101_S3	These decreases were partially offset by proceeds received in the current year from the issuance of our 6.625% senior notes.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P101_S4	Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $476.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $102.8 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P101_S5	The increase was largely due to higher net proceeds received in connection with equity offerings in 2009 and the issuance of our 11.625% senior subordinated notes in June 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P101_S6	These increases were partially offset by activity under our credit agreement, including $300.0 million of proceeds received from an additional term loan in connection with the exercise of the accordion provision of our credit agreement in 2008, partially offset by lower net borrowings under our revolving credit facility in 2008 as well as higher repayments of the senior secured term loans in 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P101_S7	Also offsetting the overall increase was lower net proceeds from notes payable on real estate within our Development Services segment in 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P101_S8	The following is a summary of our various contractual obligations and other commitments as of December 31, 2010:
1138118_11_ITEM7_P102_S0	(2) See Note 13 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P103_S0	(3) See Note 14 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P104_S0	(4) Because these obligations are related, either wholly or partially, to the future retirement of our employees and such retirement dates are not predictable, an undeterminable portion of this amount will be paid in years one through five.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P105_S0	(5) See Note 11 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P105_S1	Figures do not include scheduled interest payments.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P105_S2	The notes (primarily construction loans) have either fixed or variable interest rates, ranging from 1.85% to 13.0% at December 31, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P105_S3	In general, interest is drawn on the underlying loan and subsequently paid with proceeds received upon the sale of the real estate project.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P106_S0	(6) Due to the nature of guarantees, payments could be due at any time upon the occurrence of certain triggering events including default.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P106_S1	Accordingly, all guarantees are reflected as expiring in less than one year.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P107_S0	(7) Includes $11.5 million related to our Global Investment Management segment, all of which is expected to be funded in 2011 and $22.0 million related to our Development Services segment (callable at any time).
1138118_11_ITEM7_P108_S0	(8) As of December 31, 2010, our non-current tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, was $78.3 million.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P109_S0	We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P110_S0	(9) Represents outstanding reserves for claims under certain insurance programs, which are included in other current and other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P110_S1	Due to the nature of this item, payments could be due at any time upon the occurrence of certain events.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P110_S2	Accordingly, the entire balance has been reflected as expiring in less than one year.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P111_S0	Our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness and other obligations.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P111_S1	In addition, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or for other purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P111_S2	If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our debt, would increase.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P112_S0	Since 2001, we have maintained a credit agreement with Credit Suisse Group AG, or CS, and other lenders to fund strategic acquisitions and to provide for our working capital needs.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P112_S1	On March 24, 2009, we entered into a second amendment and restatement to our credit agreement with a syndicate of banks led by CS, as administrative and collateral agent, amending and restating our amended and restated credit agreement dated December 20, 2006.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P112_S2	In connection with this amendment and restatement, we wrote off financing costs of $29.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, which included the write-off of $18.1 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and $11.2 million of credit agreement amendment fees paid in March 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P112_S3	On August 24, 2009, we entered into a loan modification agreement to our credit agreement, which included the conversion of $41.9 million of amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility to term loans.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P112_S4	On both February 5, 2010 and March 29, 2010, we entered into additional loan modification agreements to our credit agreement to further extend debt maturities and amortization schedules.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P112_S5	On November 10, 2010, we entered into a new credit agreement (Credit Agreement), with a syndicate of banks led by CS, as administrative and collateral agent, which completely replaced our previous credit agreement.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P112_S6	In connection with the establishment of the new Credit Agreement, we wrote off financing costs of $16.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, including $12.1 million of credit agreement amendment fees paid in November 2010 and $4.6 million of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with our prior credit agreement.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P112_S7	In addition, in October 2010, we wrote off $1.4 million of unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with debt repayments made.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P113_S0	provision which provides the ability to borrow an additional $800.0 million, which can be further expanded, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P114_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2010, we repaid $1.7 billion of our senior secured term loans under our previous credit agreement.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P114_S1	In addition, we also made required principal payments of $9.5 million in December 2010 relative to senior secured term loans under our current Credit Agreement.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P114_S2	The revolving credit facility allows for borrowings outside of the U.S., with sub-facilities of $5.0 million available to one of our Canadian subsidiaries, $35.0 million in aggregate available to one of our Australian and one of our New Zealand subsidiaries and $50.0 million available to one of our U.K. subsidiaries.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P114_S3	Additionally, outstanding borrowings under these sub-facilities may be up to 5.0% higher as allowed under the currency fluctuation provision in the Credit Agreement.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P115_S0	Borrowings under the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2010 bear interest at varying rates, based at our option, on either the applicable fixed rate plus 1.65% to 3.15% or the daily rate plus 0.65% to 2.15% as determined by reference to our ratio of total debt less available cash to EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement).
1138118_11_ITEM7_P115_S1	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had $17.5 million and $21.1 million, respectively, of revolving credit facility principal outstanding with related weighted average interest rates of 3.5% and 5.3%, respectively, which are included in short-term borrowings in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P115_S2	As of December 31, 2010, letters of credit totaling $20.0 million were outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P115_S3	These letters of credit were primarily issued in the normal course of business as well as in connection with certain insurance programs and reduce the amount we may borrow under the revolving credit facility.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P116_S0	Borrowings under the term loan facilities as of December 31, 2010 bear interest, based at our option, on the following: for the tranche A term loan facility, on either the applicable fixed rate plus 2.00% to 3.75% or the daily rate plus 1.00% to 2.75%, as determined by reference to our ratio of total debt less available cash to EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement), and for the tranche B term loan facility, on either the applicable fixed rate plus 3.25% or the daily rate plus 2.25%.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P116_S1	As of December 31, 2010, we had $341.3 million of tranche A term loan facility principal outstanding and $299.2 million of tranche B term loan facility principal outstanding, which are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P116_S2	As of December 31, 2009, we had $326.3 million of tranche A term loan facility principal outstanding, $48.6 million of tranche A-1 term loan facility principal outstanding, $203.2 million of tranche A-2 term loan facility principal outstanding, $167.5 million of tranche A-3 term loan facility principal outstanding, $642.8 million of tranche B term loan facility principal outstanding and $295.2 million of tranche B-1 term loan facility principal outstanding, which are also included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P117_S0	The Credit Agreement is jointly and severally guaranteed by us and substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P117_S1	Borrowings under our Credit Agreement are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the capital stock of our U.S. subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P117_S2	Also, the Credit Agreement requires us to pay a fee based on the total amount of the revolving credit facility commitment.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P118_S0	On February 17, 2011, we announced that we are embarking on the process of seeking commitments to fund up to an aggregate of $500.0 million of delayed draw, seven year senior secured term loans under a new Tranche C facility and up to an aggregate of $300.0 million of delayed draw, eight (or more) year senior secured term loans under a new Tranche D facility (together, the New Term Loans), the proceeds of which would be used to finance our recently announced REIM Acquisitions.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P118_S1	Additionally, we are embarking on the process of seeking an amendment to our Credit Agreement that, among other things, would (1) permit additional wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company to be borrowers of the New Term Loans, (2) add an exception to the investment covenant relating to the REIM Acquisitions, (3) maintain the availability of the $800.0 million accordion provision under the Credit Agreement and (4) provide certain other ancillary amendments related thereto.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P118_S2	The terms of the New Term Loans and the proposed amendment are preliminary and subject to review and approval by us as well as the requisite lenders and, therefore, subject to further revision.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P119_S0	On October 8, 2010, CBRE issued $350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.625% senior notes due October 15, 2020.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P120_S0	future subordinated indebtedness, but effectively subordinated to all of its current and future secured indebtedness.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P121_S0	The 6.625% senior notes are jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior basis by us and each subsidiary of CBRE that guarantees our Credit Agreement.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P121_S1	Interest accrues at a rate of 6.625% per year and is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15, commencing on April 15, 2011.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P121_S2	The 6.625% senior notes are redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, on or after October 15, 2014 at a redemption price of 104.969% of the principal amount on that date and at declining prices thereafter.

1138118_11_ITEM7_P144_S0	Seasonality A significant portion of our revenue is seasonal, which can affect an investor s ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P144_S1	Historically, this seasonality has caused our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P144_S2	Earnings and cash flow have historically been particularly concentrated in the fourth quarter due to investors and companies focusing on completing transactions prior to calendar year-end.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P144_S3	This has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first quarter, with revenue and profitability improving in each subsequent quarter.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P145_S0	Inflation Our commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by real estate market supply and demand, which may be affected by general economic conditions including inflation.
1138118_11_ITEM7_P145_S1	However, to date, we do not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon our operations.

1138118_11_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported amounts of our total assets and liabilities, which are reflected in our financial statements as translated into U.S. dollars for each financial reporting period at the exchange rate in effect on the respective balance sheet dates, and our total revenue and expenses, which are reflected in our financial statements as translated into U.S. dollars for each financial reporting period at the monthly average exchange rate.
1138118_11_ITEM7A_P0_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2010, foreign currency translation had a $44.1 million positive impact on our total revenue and a $41.8 million negative impact on our total costs of services and operating, administrative and other expenses.
1138118_11_ITEM7A_P0_S5	We routinely monitor our exposure to currency exchange rate changes in connection with transactions and sometimes enter into foreign currency exchange swap, option and forward contracts to limit our exposure to such transactions, as appropriate.
1138118_11_ITEM7A_P0_S6	In the normal course of business, we also sometimes utilize derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange exposure resulting from inter-company loans, expected cash flow and earnings.
1138118_11_ITEM7A_P0_S7	We apply the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) (Topic 815) when accounting for any such contracts.
1138118_11_ITEM7A_P0_S8	In all cases, we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and, accordingly, do not engage in any speculative activities with respect to foreign currency.
1138118_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	On December 22, 2008, we entered into a foreign currency exchange swap contract with an aggregate notional amount of 39.5 million British pounds sterling, which expired on February 18, 2009, at which time we entered into another contract with similar terms that was settled on April 6, 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7A_P1_S1	On May 12, 2009, we entered into an option agreement to sell a notional amount of 25.0 million of Euros, which expired on December 29, 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7A_P1_S2	On June 26, 2009, we entered into two option agreements, including one to sell a notional amount of 5.5 million of British pounds sterling, which was exercised on September 28, 2009, and one to sell 10.0 million of British pounds sterling, which was sold on December 18, 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM7A_P1_S3	On April 6, 2010, we entered into three option agreements, including one to sell a notional amount of 4.0 million British pounds sterling, which was exercised on June 28, 2010, one to sell a notional amount of 4.0 million British pounds sterling, which expired on September 28, 2010 and one to sell a notional amount of 7.6 million British pounds sterling, which expired on December 29, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM7A_P1_S4	On April 12, 2010, we entered into three additional option agreements, including one to sell a notional amount of 2.7 million Euros, which was exercised on June 28, 2010, one to sell a notional amount of 2.4 million Euros, which was exercised on September 28, 2010 and one to sell a notional amount of 11.0 million Euros, which was exercised on December 29, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM7A_P1_S5	Included in the consolidated statement of operations were charges of $1.0 million and $3.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, resulting from net losses on foreign currency exchange option agreements.
1138118_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We also enter into loan commitments that relate to the origination or acquisition of commercial mortgage loans that will be held for resale.
1138118_11_ITEM7A_P2_S1	FASB ASC Topic 815 requires that these commitments be recorded at their fair values as derivatives.
1138118_11_ITEM7A_P2_S2	The net impact on our financial position and earnings resulting from these derivatives contracts has not been significant.
1138118_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Interest Rates We manage our interest expense by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt.
1138118_11_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Excluding notes payable on real estate, our fixed and variable rate long-term debt at December 31, 2010 consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_11_ITEM7A_P4_S0	(1) Consists of amounts due under our senior secured term loan facilities.
1138118_11_ITEM7A_P4_S1	We utilize sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect of our variable rate debt.
1138118_11_ITEM7A_P4_S2	If interest rates were to increase by 10% on our outstanding variable rate debt, excluding notes payable on real estate, at December 31, 2010, the net impact of the additional interest cost would be a decrease of $3.2 million on pre-tax income and cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM7A_P4_S3	Based upon information from third-party banks, the estimated fair value of our senior secured term loans was approximately $641.8 million at December 31, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM7A_P4_S4	Based on dealers quotes, the estimated fair values of our 6.625% and 11.625% senior subordinated notes was $347.8 million and $508.3 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM7A_P4_S5	We also have $627.5 million of notes payable on real estate as of December 31, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM7A_P4_S6	These notes have interest rates ranging from 1.85% to 13.0% with maturity dates extending through 2023.
1138118_11_ITEM7A_P4_S7	Interest costs relating to notes payable on real estate include both interest that is expensed and interest that is capitalized as part of the cost of real estate.
1138118_11_ITEM7A_P4_S8	If interest rates were to increase by 10%, our total estimated interest cost related to notes payable would increase by approximately $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM7A_P4_S9	From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap and cap agreements in order to limit our interest expense related to our notes payable on real estate.
1138118_11_ITEM7A_P4_S10	If any of these agreements are not designated as effective hedges, then they are marked to market each period with the change in fair value recognized in current period earnings.
1138118_11_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The net impact on our earnings resulting from gains and/or losses on interest rate swap and cap agreements associated with notes payable on real estate has not been significant.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	All other schedules are omitted because they are either not applicable, not required or the information required is included in the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes thereto.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P1_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc. (the Company) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, equity and comprehensive income (loss) for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P1_S1	In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the related financial statement schedules.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P1_S2	We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1138118_11_ITEM8_P1_S3	The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting .
1138118_11_ITEM8_P1_S4	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P1_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1138118_11_ITEM8_P1_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P1_S7	Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P1_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P1_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P1_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P2_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P2_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P2_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P2_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P4_S0	present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

1138118_11_ITEM8_P9_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P10_S0	Nature of Operations CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc. (which may be referred to in these financial statements as the company , we , us and our ) was incorporated on February 20, 2001.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P10_S1	We are the world s largest commercial real estate services firm, based on 2010 revenue, with leading full-service operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P10_S2	We offer a full range of services to occupiers, owners, lenders and investors in office, retail, industrial, multi-family and other types of commercial real estate.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P10_S3	As of December 31, 2010, we operated more than 300 offices worldwide, excluding affiliate offices, with approximately 31,000 employees providing commercial real estate services under the CB Richard Ellis and CBRE brand names and development services under the Trammell Crow brand name.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P10_S4	Our business is focused on several competencies, including commercial property and corporate facilities management, tenant representation, property/agency leasing, property sales, valuation, real estate investment management, commercial mortgage origination and servicing, capital markets (equity and debt) solutions, development services and proprietary research.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P10_S5	We generate revenues from contractual management fees and on a per project or transactional basis.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P10_S6	Our contractual, fee-for-services businesses, which generally involve facilities management, property management and mortgage loan servicing, as well as asset management provided by CB Richard Ellis Investors, L.L.C. and its global affiliates, which we also refer to as CBRE Investors, represented approximately 38% of our 2010 revenue.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P11_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majority-owned subsidiaries, as well as variable interest entities (VIEs) in which we are the primary beneficiary and other subsidiaries of which we have control.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P11_S1	The equity attributable to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries is shown separately in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P11_S2	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P12_S0	Our determination of the appropriate accounting method with respect to our VIEs, including co-investments with our clients, is based on Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2009-17, Consolidations (Topic 810): Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities .
1138118_11_ITEM8_P12_S1	No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) , issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in June 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P12_S2	The amendments in this ASU replace the quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation for determining which reporting entity, if any, has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with a primarily qualitative approach focused on identifying which reporting entity has both (1) the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact such entity s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from such entity that could potentially be significant to such entity.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P12_S3	The entity which satisfies these criteria is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P13_S0	We determine if an entity is a VIE based on several factors, including whether the entity s total equity investment at risk upon inception is sufficient to finance the entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P13_S1	We make judgments regarding the sufficiency of the equity at risk based first on a qualitative analysis, then a quantitative analysis, if necessary.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P14_S0	We analyze any investments in VIEs to determine if we are the primary beneficiary.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P15_S0	economic performance including, but not limited to, the ability to direct financing, leasing, construction and other operating decisions and activities.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P15_S1	In addition, we also consider the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions, to replace the manager and to sell or liquidate the entity.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P15_S2	We also have several co-investments in real estate investment funds which qualify for a deferral of the newer qualitative approach for analyzing potential VIEs.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P15_S3	We continue to analyze these investments under the former quantitative method incorporating various estimates, including estimated future cash flows, asset hold periods and discount rates, as well as estimates of the probabilities of various scenarios occurring.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P16_S0	If the entity is a VIE, we then determine whether we consolidate the entity as the primary beneficiary.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P16_S1	This determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary includes any impact of an upside economic interest in the form of a promote that we may have.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P17_S0	A promote is an interest built into the distribution structure of the entity based on the entity s achievement of certain return hurdles.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P17_S1	We consolidate any VIE of which we are the primary beneficiary (see Note 3) and disclose significant VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary, if any.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P17_S2	We determine whether an entity is a VIE and, if so, whether it should be consolidated by utilizing judgments and estimates that are inherently subjective.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P17_S3	If we made different judgments or utilized different estimates in these evaluations, it could result in differing conclusions as to whether or not an entity is a VIE and whether or not to consolidate such entity.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P17_S4	If an entity is not a VIE, our determination of the appropriate accounting method with respect to our investments in limited partnerships, limited liability companies and other subsidiaries is based on voting control.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P17_S5	For our general partner interests, we are presumed to control (and therefore consolidate) the entity, unless the other limited partners have substantive rights that overcome this presumption of control.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P17_S6	These substantive rights allow the limited partners to participate in significant decisions made in the ordinary course of the entity s business.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P17_S7	We account for our non-controlling general partner investments in these entities under the equity method.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P17_S8	This treatment also applies to our managing member interests in limited liability companies.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P17_S9	Our determination of the appropriate accounting method for all other investments in subsidiaries is based on the amount of influence we have (including our ownership interest) in the underlying entity.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P17_S10	Those other investments where we have the ability to exercise significant influence (but not control) over operating and financial policies of such subsidiaries (including certain subsidiaries where we have less than 20% ownership) are accounted for using the equity method.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P17_S11	We eliminate transactions with such equity method subsidiaries to the extent of our ownership in such subsidiaries.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P17_S12	Accordingly, our share of the earnings or losses of these equity method subsidiaries is included in consolidated net income.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P17_S13	All of our remaining investments are carried at cost.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P18_S0	Under either the equity or cost method, impairment losses are recognized upon evidence of other-than-temporary losses of value.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P19_S0	When testing for impairment on investments that are not actively traded on a public market, we generally use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our investments and/or look to comparable activities in the marketplace.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P19_S1	Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow approach.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P19_S2	These assumptions include net asset values, internal rates of return, discount and capitalization rates, interest rates and financing terms, rental rates, timing of leasing activity, estimates of lease terms and related concessions, etc.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P19_S3	When determining if impairment is other-than-temporary, we also look to the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been less than cost as well as the financial condition and near-term prospects of each investment.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P20_S0	Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.), which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P20_S1	These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, and reported amounts of revenue and expenses.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P20_S2	Such estimates include the value of goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets, accounts receivable, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, retirement and other post-employment benefits, among others.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P20_S3	These estimates and assumptions are based on management s best estimates and judgment.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P20_S4	Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including consideration of the current economic environment, and adjusts such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P20_S5	Illiquid credit markets, volatile equity, foreign currency, among other things, have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P20_S6	As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P20_S7	Changes in those estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P21_S0	The fair value of our goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets is impacted by economic conditions, the capital markets and our stock price.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P21_S1	Sales and leasing activity is affected by general economic activity and employment growth, credit availability and pricing, business and consumer sentiment, inflation levels and the health of the capital markets generally.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P21_S2	Adverse trends involving any or all of these factors could reduce incentive-based revenue as well as real estate sales volume and values.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P21_S3	Such adverse economic conditions could cause declines in the estimated future discounted cash flows expected for our reporting units.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P21_S4	A major or sustained decline in our future cash flows and/or the current economic conditions could result in additional impairment charges.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P22_S0	The recoverability of our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries has been impacted by the significant capital market turmoil that began in the fourth quarter of 2008.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P23_S0	Following the global financial crisis, commercial real estate fundamentals weakened significantly, reflecting the overall downturn in the economy.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P23_S1	Throughout 2009, transactions were sharply reduced by the illiquidity in the capital markets as many lenders sharply curtailed lending for commercial real estate.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P23_S2	As liquidity improved during 2010, transaction volume began to revive, though remained well below levels experienced in 2006 and 2007.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P23_S3	However, the effects of the 2008-2009 capital markets turmoil continued to take a toll on property values.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P23_S4	The assumptions utilized in our recoverability analysis reflected our belief that the recovery from the severe downturn would be slow and that challenging conditions could persist for some time, resulting in the potential for additional write-downs, especially if turmoil re-emerges in the capital markets.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P24_S0	The recoverability of the carrying value of our investments in real estate is impacted by general conditions in the U.S. economy and commercial real estate market.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P25_S0	Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, market fundamentals in the primary product types which we develop/own weakened significantly.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P25_S1	The high unemployment rate negatively impacted office markets as companies deferred occupancy decisions and placed space on the market for sublease.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P25_S2	Weak industrial production adversely affected warehouse and distribution markets.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P25_S3	The retail sector was negatively affected by declining sales and retailers experiencing financial difficulty.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P25_S4	These trends began to abate in 2010 as real estate market conditions improved, and transactions began to revive from the depressed levels of 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P25_S5	Capitalization rates have stabilized and begun to contract modestly as potential buyers and liquidity returned to the commercial real estate market.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P25_S6	However, if conditions in the broader economy, capital markets, commercial real estate industry, specific markets or product types in which we operate once again decline, we could have additional impairment charges.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P26_S0	CB RICHARD ELLIS GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents generally consist of cash and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of less than three months.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P27_S0	We manage certain cash and cash equivalents as an agent for our investment and property management clients.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P27_S1	These amounts are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets (see Note 18).
1138118_11_ITEM8_P28_S0	Restricted Cash Included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 is restricted cash of $52.3 million and $46.8 million, respectively.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P28_S1	The balances primarily include restricted cash set aside to cover funding obligations as required by contracts executed by us in the normal course of business, including escrow accounts held in our Development Services segment.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P29_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist principally of trade receivables and interest-bearing investments.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P29_S1	Users of real estate services account for a substantial portion of trade receivables and collateral is generally not required.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P29_S2	The risk associated with this concentration is limited due to the large number of users and their geographic dispersion.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P30_S0	We place substantially all of our interest-bearing investments with major financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P31_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P31_S1	Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment is computed primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging up to 15 years.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P32_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the term of their associated leases, excluding options to renew, since such leases generally do not carry prohibitive penalties for non-renewal.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P33_S0	We capitalize expenditures that materially increase the life of our assets and expense the costs of maintenance and repairs.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P33_S1	We review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P33_S2	If this review indicates that such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment is recognized in the period the changes occur and represents the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P33_S3	We did not recognize an impairment loss related to property and equipment in 2010, 2009 or 2008.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P34_S0	Certain costs related to the development or purchase of internal-use software are capitalized.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P34_S1	Internal computer software costs that are incurred in the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P34_S2	Direct consulting costs as well as payroll and related costs, which are incurred during the development stage of a project are capitalized and amortized over a three-year period when placed into production.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P35_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting, which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P36_S0	purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P36_S1	The majority of our goodwill balance has resulted from our acquisition of CB Richard Ellis Services, Inc. (CBRE) in 2001 (the 2001 Acquisition), our acquisition of Insignia Financial Group, Inc. (Insignia) in 2003 (the Insignia Acquisition) and our acquisition of the Trammell Crow Company in 2006 (the Trammell Crow Company Acquisition).
1138118_11_ITEM8_P36_S2	Other intangible assets include a trademark, which was separately identified as a result of the 2001 Acquisition, as well as a trade name separately identified as a result of the Insignia Acquisition representing the Richard Ellis trade name in the United Kingdom (U.K.) that was owned by Insignia prior to the Insignia Acquisition.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P36_S3	Both the trademark and the trade name are not being amortized and have indefinite estimated useful lives.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P36_S4	The remaining other intangible assets primarily include customer relationships, management contracts, loan servicing rights and franchise agreements, which are all being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging up to 20 years.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P36_S5	We are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P37_S0	The goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step process.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P38_S0	The first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P38_S1	We use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P38_S2	Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P38_S3	These assumptions include revenue growth rates, profit margin percentages, discount rates, etc.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P39_S0	If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered to not be impaired.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P39_S1	If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P40_S0	The second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P40_S1	The implied fair value of goodwill is determined similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination, by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one, over the estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P40_S2	Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business s fair value and the relative size of our goodwill, if different assumptions and estimates were used, it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P41_S0	Deferred Financing Costs Costs incurred in connection with financing activities are generally deferred and amortized over the terms of the related debt agreements ranging up to ten years.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P41_S1	Amortization of these costs is charged to interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P41_S2	Total deferred financing costs, net of accumulated amortization, included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were $34.1 million and $29.2 million, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P41_S3	In connection with the new credit agreement we entered into on November 10, 2010, we wrote off financing costs of $16.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, including $12.1 million of credit agreement amendment fees paid in November 2010 and $4.6 million of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with our prior credit agreement.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P41_S4	In addition, in October 2010, we wrote off $1.4 million of unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with debt repayments made.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P41_S5	In connection with the March 24, 2009 amendment and restatement to our prior credit agreement, we wrote off financing costs of $29.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, which included the write-off of $18.1 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and $11.2 million of credit agreement amendment fees paid in March 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P41_S6	All of these write-offs were included in write-off of financing costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P41_S7	See Note 12 for additional information on activities associated with our debt.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P42_S0	CB RICHARD ELLIS GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Revenue Recognition We record commission revenue on real estate sales generally upon close of escrow or transfer of title, except when future contingencies exist.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P42_S1	Real estate commissions on leases are generally recorded in revenue when all obligations under the commission agreement are satisfied.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P43_S0	Terms and conditions of a commission agreement may include, but are not limited to, execution of a signed lease agreement and future contingencies including tenant occupancy, payment of a deposit or payment of a first month s rent (or a combination thereof).
1138118_11_ITEM8_P43_S1	As some of these conditions are outside of our control and are often not clearly defined, judgment must be exercised in determining when such required events have occurred in order to recognize revenue.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P44_S0	A typical commission agreement provides that we earn a portion of a lease commission upon the execution of the lease agreement by the tenant and landlord, with the remaining portion(s) of the lease commission earned at a later date, usually upon tenant occupancy or payment of rent.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P44_S1	The existence of any significant future contingencies results in the delay of recognition of corresponding revenue until such contingencies are satisfied.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P44_S2	For example, if we do not earn all or a portion of the lease commission until the tenant pays its first month s rent, and the lease agreement provides the tenant with a free rent period, we delay revenue recognition until rent is paid by the tenant.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P45_S0	Property management revenues are generally based upon percentages of the revenue or base rent generated by the entities managed or the square footage managed.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P45_S1	These fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related management agreements.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P46_S0	Investment management fees are based predominantly upon a percentage of the equity deployed on behalf of our limited partners.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P46_S1	Fees related to our indirect investment management programs are based upon a percentage of the fair value of those investments.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P46_S2	These fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related investment management agreements.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P47_S0	Our Global Investment Management segment earns performance-based incentive fees with regard to many of its investments.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P47_S1	Such revenue is recognized at the end of the measurement periods when the conditions of the applicable incentive fee arrangements have been satisfied and following the expiration of any potential claw back provision.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P47_S2	With many of these investments, our Global Investment Management team has participation interests in such incentive fees, which are commonly referred to as carried interest.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P47_S3	This carried interest expense is generally accrued for based upon the probability of such performance-based incentive fees being earned over the related vesting period.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P47_S4	In addition, our Global Investment Management segment also earns success-based transaction fees with regard to buying or selling properties on certain funds and separate accounts.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P47_S5	Such revenue is recognized at the completion of a successful transaction and is not subject to any claw back provision.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P48_S0	Appraisal fees are recorded after services have been rendered.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P48_S1	and we have no significant remaining obligations for performance in connection with the transaction, while loan servicing fees are recorded in revenue as monthly principal and interest payments are collected from mortgagors.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P48_S2	Other commissions, consulting fees and referral fees are recorded as revenue at the time the related services have been performed, unless significant future contingencies exist.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P49_S0	Development services and project management services generate fees from development and construction management projects.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P49_S1	For projects where we operate as a general contractor, fees are generally recognized using the percentage-of-completion method based on costs incurred as a percentage of total expected costs.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P49_S2	Some development and construction management and project management assignments are subject to agreements that describe the calculation of fees and when we earn such fees.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P49_S3	The earnings terms of these agreements dictate when we recognize the related revenue.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P50_S0	We may earn incentive fees for project management services based upon achievement of certain performance criteria as set forth in the project management services agreement.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P51_S0	earn incentive development fees by reaching specified time table, leasing, budget or value creation targets, as defined in the relevant development services agreement.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P51_S1	Certain incentive development fees allow us to share in the fair value of the developed real estate asset above cost.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P51_S2	This sharing creates additional revenue potential to us with no exposure to loss other than opportunity cost.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P51_S3	We recognize such fees when the specified target is attained and fees are deemed collectible.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P52_S0	We record deferred income to the extent that cash payments have been received in accordance with the terms of underlying agreements, but such amounts have not yet met the criteria for revenue recognition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P52_S1	We recognize such revenues when the appropriate criteria are met.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P52_S2	We account for certain reimbursements (primarily salaries and related charges) mainly related to our facilities and property management operations as revenue.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P52_S3	Reimbursement revenue is recognized when the underlying reimbursable costs are incurred.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P53_S0	In establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables, we make assumptions with respect to future collectability.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P53_S1	Our assumptions are based on an assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends, including the aging of receivables balances.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P53_S2	In addition to these assessments, in general, outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are more than 180 days overdue are evaluated for collectability and fully provided for if deemed uncollectible.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P54_S0	Historically, our credit losses have generally been insignificant.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P54_S1	However, estimating losses requires significant judgment, and conditions may change or new information may become known after any periodic evaluation.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P54_S2	As a result, actual credit losses may differ from our estimates.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P55_S0	Real Estate Classification and Impairment Evaluation We classify real estate in accordance with the criteria of the Property, Plant and Equipment Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) (Topic 360) as follows: (i) real estate held for sale, which includes completed assets or land for sale in its present condition that meet all of Topic 360 s held for sale criteria, (ii) real estate under development (current), which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of within one year of the balance sheet date; (iii) real estate under development (non-current), which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of more than one year from the balance sheet date; or (iv) real estate held for investment, which consists of land on which development activities have not yet commenced and completed assets or land held for disposition that do not meet the held for sale criteria.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P55_S1	Any asset reclassified from real estate held for sale to real estate under development (current or non-current) or real estate held for investment is recorded individually at the lower of its fair value at the date of the reclassification or its carrying amount before it was classified as held for sale, adjusted (in the case of real estate held for investment) for any depreciation that would have been recognized had the asset been continuously classified as real estate held for investment.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P55_S2	Real estate held for sale is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P55_S3	If an asset s fair value less cost to sell, based on discounted future cash flows, management estimates or market comparisons, is less than its carrying amount, an allowance is recorded against the asset.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P55_S4	Real estate under development and real estate held for investment are carried at cost less depreciation, as applicable.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P55_S5	Buildings and improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, generally up to 39 years.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P56_S0	estate held for investment are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or terms of the respective leases.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P56_S1	Land improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, up to 15 years.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P56_S2	When indicators of impairment are present, real estate under development and real estate held for investment are evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset or market comparisons are less than the asset s carrying amount.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P56_S3	The amount of the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value, which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, management estimates or market comparisons.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P57_S0	Cost Capitalization and Allocation When acquiring, developing and constructing real estate assets, we capitalize costs.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P57_S1	Capitalization begins when the activities related to development have begun and ceases when activities are substantially complete and the asset is available for occupancy.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P57_S2	Costs capitalized include pursuit costs, or pre-acquisition/pre-construction costs, taxes and insurance, interest, development and construction costs and costs of incidental operations.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P58_S0	We expense transaction costs for acquisitions that qualify as a business in accordance with the Business Combinations Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 805).
1138118_11_ITEM8_P58_S1	Pursuit costs capitalized in connection with a potential development project that we have determined not to pursue are written off in the period that determination is made.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P59_S0	At times, we purchase bulk land that we intend to sell or develop in phases.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P59_S1	The land basis allocated to each phase is based on the relative estimated fair value of the phases before construction.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P59_S2	We allocate construction costs incurred relating to more than one phase between the various phases; if the costs cannot be specifically attributed to a certain phase or the improvements benefit more than one phase, we allocate the costs between the phases based on their relative estimated sales values, where practicable, or other value methods as appropriate under the circumstances.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P59_S3	Relative allocations of the costs are revised as the sales value estimates are revised.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P60_S0	When acquiring real estate with existing buildings, we allocate the purchase price between land, land improvements, building and intangibles related to in-place leases, if any, based on their relative fair values.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P60_S1	The fair values of acquired land and buildings are determined based on an estimated discounted future cash flow model with lease-up assumptions as if the building was vacant upon acquisition.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P60_S2	The fair value of in-place leases includes the value of lease intangibles for above or below-market rents and tenant origination costs, determined on a lease by lease basis.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P60_S3	The capitalized values for both lease intangibles and tenant origination costs are amortized over the term of the underlying leases.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P60_S4	Amortization related to lease intangibles is recorded as either an increase to or a reduction of rental income and amortization for tenant origination costs is recorded to amortization expense.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P61_S0	Disposition of Real Estate Gains on disposition of real estate are recognized upon sale of the underlying project.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P61_S1	We evaluate each real estate sale transaction to determine if it qualifies for gain recognition under the full accrual method.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P61_S2	If the transaction does not meet the criteria for the full accrual method of profit recognition based on our assessment, we account for a sale based on an appropriate deferral method determined by the nature and extent of the buyer s investment and our continuing involvement.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P62_S0	component have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P63_S0	As defined in Topic 360, a component of an entity comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the rest of the entity.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P63_S1	Because each of our real estate assets is generally accounted for in a discrete subsidiary, many constitute a component of an entity under Topic 360, increasing the likelihood that the disposition of assets that we hold for sale in the ordinary course of business must be reported as a discontinued operation unless we have significant continuing involvement in the operations of the asset after its disposition.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P63_S2	Furthermore, operating profits and losses on such assets are required to be recognized and reported as operating profits and losses on discontinued operations in the periods in which they occur.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P64_S0	The costs of business promotion and advertising are expensed as incurred.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P64_S1	Business promotion and advertising costs of $37.5 million, $27.5 million and $55.1 million were included in operating, administrative and other expenses for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P65_S0	The financial statements of subsidiaries located outside the U.S. are generally measured using the local currency as the functional currency.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P65_S1	The assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date, and income and expenses are translated at the average monthly rate.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P65_S2	The resulting translation adjustments are included in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of equity.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P65_S3	Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the results of operations.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P65_S4	The aggregate transaction losses (gains) included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $4.0 million, $0.6 million and ($6.4) million, respectively.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P66_S0	Derivative Financial Instruments We routinely monitor our exposure to currency exchange rate changes in connection with transactions and sometimes enter into foreign currency exchange swap, option and forward contracts to limit our exposure to such transactions, as appropriate.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P66_S1	In the normal course of business, we also sometimes utilize derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange exposure resulting from intercompany loans, expected cash flow and earnings.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P66_S2	We apply the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 815) when accounting for any such contracts.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P66_S3	Topic 815 requires us to recognize all qualifying derivative instruments as assets or liabilities on our balance sheet and measure them at fair value.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P66_S4	This literature requires that changes in the fair value of derivatives be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P66_S5	In all cases, we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and, accordingly, do not engage in any speculative activities with respect to foreign currency.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P67_S0	On December 22, 2008, we entered into a foreign currency exchange swap contract with an aggregate notional amount of 39.5 million British pounds sterling, which expired on February 18, 2009, at which time we entered into another contract with similar terms that was settled on April 6, 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P67_S1	On May 12, 2009, we entered into an option agreement to sell a notional amount of 25.0 million of Euros, which expired on December 29, 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P67_S2	On June 26, 2009, we entered into two option agreements, including one to sell a notional amount of 5.5 million of British pounds sterling, which was exercised on September 28, 2009, and one to sell 10.0 million of British pounds sterling, which was sold on December 18, 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P68_S0	on June 28, 2010, one to sell a notional amount of 4.0 million British pounds sterling, which expired on September 28, 2010 and one to sell a notional amount of 7.6 million British pounds sterling, which expired on December 29, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P68_S1	On April 12, 2010, we entered into three additional option agreements, including one to sell a notional amount of 2.7 million Euros, which was exercised on June 28, 2010, one to sell a notional amount of 2.4 million Euros, which was exercised on September 28, 2010 and one to sell a notional amount of 11.0 million Euros, which was exercised on December 29, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P68_S2	Included in the consolidated statements of operations were net losses of $1.0 million, net losses of $3.7 million and net gains of $1.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, resulting from net losses and gains on foreign currency exchange swap, option and forward contracts.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P69_S0	We also enter into loan commitments that relate to the origination or acquisition of commercial mortgage loans that will be held for resale.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P69_S1	Topic 815 requires that these commitments be recorded at their fair values as derivatives.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P69_S2	The net impact on our financial position and earnings resulting from these derivatives contracts has not been significant.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P70_S0	From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap and cap agreements in order to limit our interest expense related to our notes payable on real estate.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P70_S1	If any of these agreements are not designated as effective hedges, then they are marked to market each period with the change in fair value recognized in current period earnings.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P71_S0	The net impact on our earnings resulting from gains and/or losses on interest rate swap and cap agreements associated with notes payable on real estate has not been significant.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P72_S0	Comprehensive Income (Loss) Comprehensive income (loss) consists of net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss).
1138118_11_ITEM8_P72_S1	In the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, accumulated other comprehensive loss consists of foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized gains (losses) on interest rate swaps and interest rate caps, unrealized holding gains (losses) on available for sale securities and other pension liability adjustments.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P72_S2	Foreign currency translation adjustments exclude any income tax effect given that earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries are deemed to be reinvested for an indefinite period of time (see Note 15).
1138118_11_ITEM8_P73_S0	Marketable Securities We account for investments in marketable debt and equity securities in accordance with the Investments Debt and Equity Securities Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 320).
1138118_11_ITEM8_P73_S1	We determine the appropriate classification of debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P73_S2	Marketable securities we acquire with the intent to generate a profit from short-term movements in market prices would be classified as trading securities.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P73_S3	Debt securities are classified as held to maturity when we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P73_S4	Marketable equity and debt securities not classified as trading or held to maturity are classified as available for sale.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P74_S0	Trading securities are carried at their fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in net income.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P74_S1	Available for sale securities are carried at their fair value and any difference between cost and fair value is recorded as unrealized gain or loss, net of income taxes, and is reported as accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated statement of equity.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P75_S0	Premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the effective interest method.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P75_S1	Realized gains and losses and declines in value expected to be other-than-temporary on available for sale securities have not been significant.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P76_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P76_S1	Interest and dividends on securities classified as available for sale are included in interest income.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P77_S0	Our wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE Capital Markets is a Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) approved Multifamily Program Plus Seller/Servicer and an approved Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) Aggregation and Negotiated Transaction Seller/Servicer.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P77_S1	In addition, CBRE Capital Markets wholly-owned subsidiary Multifamily Capital is an approved Fannie Mae Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS) Seller/Servicer and CBRE Capital Markets wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE HMF is a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) approved Non-Supervised Federal Housing Authority (FHA) Title II Mortgagee, an approved Multifamily Accelerated Processing (MAP) lender and an approved Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) issuer of mortgage-backed securities (MBS).
1138118_11_ITEM8_P78_S0	Under these arrangements, before loans are originated through proceeds from warehouse lines of credit, we obtain either a contractual loan purchase commitment from either Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae or a confirmed forward trade commitment for the issuance and purchase of a Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae MBS that will be secured by the loans.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P78_S1	The warehouse lines of credit are generally repaid within a one-month period when Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae buys the loans or upon settlement of the Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae MBS, while we retain the servicing rights.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P79_S0	Loans are funded at the prevailing market rates.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P80_S0	We elect the fair value option for all warehouse receivables.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P80_S1	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, all of the warehouse receivables included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were either under commitment to be purchased by Freddie Mac or had confirmed forward trade commitments for the issuance and purchase of Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae mortgage backed securities that will be secured by the underlying loans.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P81_S0	In connection with the origination and sale of mortgage loans with servicing rights retained, we record servicing assets or liabilities based on the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights on the date the loans are sold.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P81_S1	We also assume or purchase certain servicing assets.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P81_S2	Servicing assets are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value in other intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are amortized in proportion to and over the estimated period that net servicing income is expected to be received based on projections and timing of estimated future net cash flows.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P81_S3	Our recording of loan servicing rights at their fair value resulted in net gains, which have been reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P82_S0	The amount of loan servicing rights recognized during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was as follows (dollars in thousands): Management evaluates its mortgage servicing assets for impairment on an annual basis or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P83_S0	Mortgage servicing rights do not actively trade in an open market with readily available observable prices; therefore, fair value is determined based on certain assumptions and judgments, including the estimation of the present value of future cash flows realized from servicing the underlying mortgage loans.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P84_S0	(servicing fee income and interest on escrow deposits), inflation, the cost of servicing, prepayment rates, delinquencies, discount rate and the estimated life of servicing cash flows.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P84_S1	The assumptions used are subject to change based on management s judgments and estimates of changes in future cash flows and interest rates, among other things.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P84_S2	We did not incur any impairment charges related to our servicing rights during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 or 2008.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P85_S0	Accounting for Broker Draws As part of our recruitment efforts relative to new U.S. brokers, we offer a transitional broker draw arrangement.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P85_S1	Our broker draw arrangements generally last until such time as a broker s pipeline of business is sufficient to allow him or her to earn sustainable commissions.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P86_S0	This program is intended to provide the broker with a minimal amount of cash flow to allow adequate time for his or her training as well as time for him or her to develop business relationships.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P86_S1	Similar to traditional salaries, the broker draws are paid irrespective of the actual revenues generated by the broker.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P86_S2	Often these broker draws represent the only form of compensation received by the broker.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P86_S3	Furthermore, it is not our general policy to pursue collection of unearned broker draws paid under this arrangement.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P86_S4	As a result, we have concluded that broker draws are economically equivalent to salaries paid and accordingly charge them to compensation as incurred.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P87_S0	The broker is also entitled to earn a commission on completed revenue transactions.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P87_S1	This amount is calculated as the commission that would have been payable under our full commission program, less any amounts previously paid to the broker in the form of a draw.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P88_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We account for all employee awards under the fair value recognition provisions of the Compensation Stock Compensation Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 718).
1138118_11_ITEM8_P88_S1	Topic 718 requires the measurement of compensation cost at the grant date, based upon the estimated fair value of the award, and requires amortization of the related expense over the employee s requisite service period.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P88_S2	See Note 14 for additional information on our stock-based compensation plans.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P89_S0	Basic income (loss) per share attributable to CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc. is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc. shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P89_S1	The computation of diluted income per share attributable to CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc. generally further assumes the dilutive effect of potential common shares, which include stock options and certain contingently issuable shares.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P90_S0	Contingently issuable shares consist of non-vested stock awards.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P90_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2008, all stock options and contingently issuable shares were anti-dilutive since we reported a net loss for the period.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P90_S2	As a result, basic and diluted loss per share was the same for the year ended December 31, 2008 (see Note 17).
1138118_11_ITEM8_P91_S0	Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with the Accounting for Income Taxes Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 740).
1138118_11_ITEM8_P92_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P92_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P93_S0	effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P94_S0	Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P95_S0	Self-Insurance Our wholly-owned captive insurance companies, which are subject to applicable insurance rules and regulations, insures our exposure related to workers compensation benefits provided to employees and purchases excess coverage from an unrelated insurance carrier.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P95_S1	We purchase general liability and automotive insurance through an unrelated insurance carrier.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P95_S2	The captive insurance companies reinsure the related deductibles.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P95_S3	The captive insurance companies also insure deductibles relating to other coverages.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P95_S4	Given the nature of these types of claims, it may take several years for resolution and determination of the cost of these claims.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P95_S5	We are required to estimate the cost of these claims in our financial statements.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P95_S6	We are responsible for estimating our exposure to workers compensation, general liability, automotive claims and professional indemnity claims.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P95_S7	The estimates that we utilize to record our potential losses on claims are inherently subjective, and actual claims could differ from amounts recorded, which could result in increased or decreased expense in future periods.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P95_S8	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, our reserve for claims under these insurance programs were $35.4 million and $27.1 million, respectively, which were included in other current and other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P95_S9	Of these amounts, $8.2 million and $6.3 million, respectively, represented our estimated current liabilities as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P95_S10	Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Limited Life Subsidiaries As of December 31, 2010, the estimated settlement value of non-controlling interests in our consolidated limited life subsidiaries was $110.1 million, as compared to the carrying value of $107.1 million, which was included in non-controlling interests in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P95_S11	As of December 31, 2009, the carrying value of non-controlling interests in our consolidated limited life subsidiaries, which was included in non-controlling interests in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, was $113.3 million, which approximated its settlement value.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P96_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-06, Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements , which provides amendments to the FASB ASC Subtopic 820-10 that require new disclosures regarding (i) transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and (ii) activity in Level 3 fair value measurements.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P96_S1	ASU 2010-06 also clarifies existing disclosures regarding (i) the level of asset and liability disaggregation and (ii) fair value measurement inputs and valuation techniques.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P96_S2	As required, we adopted the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosure requirements, except for the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P96_S3	Those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P96_S4	We are currently evaluating the disclosure impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements, but do not expect it to have a material impact.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P97_S0	Consolidated Variable Interest Entities We adopted ASU 2009-17 effective January 1, 2010 and as a result, we began consolidating certain variable interest entities that were not previously consolidated by us.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P98_S0	CB RICHARD ELLIS GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) A consolidated subsidiary (the Venture) sponsored investments by third-party investors in eight commercial properties through the formation of tenant-in-common limited liability companies and Delaware Statutory Trusts (collectively referred to as the Entities ) that are owned by the third-party investors.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P98_S1	The Venture also formed and is a member of a limited liability company for each property that serves as master tenant (Master Tenant).
1138118_11_ITEM8_P98_S2	Each Master Tenant leases the property from the Entities through a master lease agreement.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P98_S3	Pursuant to the master lease agreements, the Master Tenant has the power to direct the day-to-day asset management activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the Entities.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P98_S4	As a result, the Entities were deemed to be variable interest entities since the third-party investors holding the equity investment at risk in the Entities do not direct the day-to-day activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the properties held by the Entities.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P98_S5	The Venture has made and may continue to make voluntary contributions to each of these properties to support their operations beyond the cash flow generated by the properties themselves.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P98_S6	As of the most recent reconsideration date, such financial support has been significant enough that the Venture was deemed to be the primary beneficiary of each entity.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P98_S7	During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Venture funded $1.2 million of financial support to the Entities.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P98_S8	The Entities were initially consolidated by the Venture upon adoption of ASU 2009-17 on January 1, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P98_S9	The Entities assets and associated mortgage notes payable aggregated $251.0 million and $221.5 million, respectively, and were recorded based on their fair value at adoption.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P98_S10	We did not recognize a gain or loss on the initial consolidation of these Entities.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P98_S11	The assets of the Entities are the sole collateral for the mortgage notes payable and other liabilities of the Entities and as such, the creditors and equity investors of these Entities have no recourse to our assets held outside of these Entities.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P98_S12	For the year ended December 31, 2010, aggregate revenue of $34.5 million and operating expenses of $20.9 million relating to the operating activities of the Entities are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P98_S13	The aggregate losses of the Entities for the year ended December 31, 2010 are $13.2 million and are all attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P98_S14	Investments in real estate of $243.0 million and nonrecourse mortgage notes payable of $223.1 million ($34.9 million of which is current) are included in real estate assets held for investment and notes payable on real estate, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P98_S15	In addition, non-controlling interests of $20.6 million in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2010 are attributable to the Entities.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P99_S0	The Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 820) defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P99_S1	Topic 820 also establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P99_S2	This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P99_S3	The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:
1138118_11_ITEM8_P100_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P101_S0	Level 2 Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P102_S0	Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P102_S1	This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P103_S0	The fair value measurements employed for our impairment evaluations were generally based on a discounted cash flow approach and/or review of comparable activities in the market place.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P103_S1	Inputs used in these evaluations included risk-free rates of return, estimated risk premiums as well as other economic variables.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P104_S0	The following non-recurring fair value measurements were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 (dollars in thousands): Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded write-downs of $11.8 million, of which $3.8 million were attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P104_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2010, $9.4 million of the investments write-downs were reported in our Global Investment Management segment and driven by a decrease in the estimated holding period of certain assets.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P104_S2	In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred an additional $1.2 million of impairment charges in our Global Investment Management segment and we incurred write-downs of $1.2 million in our Development Services segment, all driven by a decline in value of several investments attributable to slower than expected leasing.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P104_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded investment write-downs of $35.7 million, of which $9.2 million were attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P104_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2009, $10.7 million of the investment write-downs were reported in our Global Investment Management segment and were primarily driven by a decrease in the estimated holding period of certain assets.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P104_S5	In addition, $7.0 million of investment write-downs were reported in our Development Services segment, primarily resulting from the weak economic conditions, including high unemployment and slow leasing.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P104_S6	Lastly, during the year ended December 31, 2009, we incurred an additional $18.0 million of impairment charges, mainly attributable to declines in value of several investments, primarily as a result of significant capital market turmoil.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P104_S7	Of the additional impairment charges noted above, $9.9 million was reported in our Global Investment Management segment and $8.1 million was reported in our Development Services segment.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P105_S0	CB RICHARD ELLIS GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) All of our impairment charges related to investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries were included in equity income (loss) from unconsolidated subsidiaries in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P106_S0	When we performed our impairment analysis, the assumptions utilized reflected our outlook for the commercial real estate industry and the impact on our business.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P106_S1	This outlook incorporated our belief that market conditions deteriorated and that these challenging conditions could persist for some time.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P107_S0	Real Estate During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded charges of $26.9 million, including impairment charges on real estate held for investment and provisions for losses on real estate held for sale.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P107_S1	Of this amount, $23.8 million was attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P108_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded impairment charges of $24.6 million related to nine real estate projects primarily due to a decrease in the estimated holding period of several of the projects and continued capital market disruption.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P108_S1	Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded provisions for losses on real estate held for sale of $2.3 million to reduce the carrying values of two office buildings, an operating hotel and a land parcel to their fair value less cost to sell, primarily due to reduced expected selling prices resulting from continued challenging market conditions.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P108_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded charges of $32.7 million, including impairment charges on real estate held for investment and provision for losses on real estate held for sale.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P108_S3	Of this amount, $27.0 million was attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P109_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded impairment charges of $28.8 million related to 13 projects where the carrying value was not recoverable primarily due to a decrease in the estimated holding periods of the projects.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P109_S1	Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded provision for losses on real estate held for sale of $3.9 million to reduce the carrying values of a condominium project and two pieces of land to their fair value less cost to sell, primarily due to reduced selling prices resulting from market conditions.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P109_S2	All of the above-mentioned charges were included in operating, administrative and other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations within our Development Services segment.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P110_S0	If conditions in the broader economy, commercial real estate industry, specific markets or product types in which we operate worsen and/or markets remain illiquid, we may be required to evaluate additional projects or re-evaluate previously impaired projects for potential impairment.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P110_S1	These evaluations could result in additional impairment charges, which may be material.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P111_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2010 we recorded a $0.3 million impairment charge on a note receivable secured by real estate, due to a decrease in value of the borrower s real estate project, the proceeds from the sale of which would be used to repay the note receivable.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P111_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded a $5.9 million impairment charge on two notes receivable secured by real estate as a result of the borrower defaulting on the notes.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P111_S2	Of this amount, $5.4 million was attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P111_S3	These defaults resulted from the borrowers noncompliance with certain terms of the note agreements.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P111_S4	As a result, we accepted assignment of the underlying real estate assets in lieu of foreclosing under our security deeds.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P111_S5	The impairment charge we recorded represents the difference between the carrying amounts of the notes and the fair value of the real estate assets acquired.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P111_S6	This transaction also resulted in a non-cash reclassification of $17.3 million from notes receivable to real estate held for investment during the year ended December 31, 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P112_S0	CB RICHARD ELLIS GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) All of our impairment charges associated with notes receivable were included in operating, administrative and other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations within our Development Services segment.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P113_S0	We do not have any material assets or liabilities that are required to be recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P114_S0	Topic 820 also requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as follows: Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash : These balances include cash and cash equivalents as well as restricted cash with maturities of less than three months.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P114_S1	The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P115_S0	Receivables, less Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: Due to their short-term nature, fair value approximates carrying value.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P115_S1	Warehouse Receivables: Due to their short-term nature, fair value approximates carrying value.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P115_S2	Fair value is determined based on the terms and conditions of funded mortgage loans and generally reflects the values of the warehouse lines of credit outstanding for our wholly-owned subsidiary, CBRE Capital Markets (see Note 12).
1138118_11_ITEM8_P115_S3	Available for Sale Securities: These investments are carried at their fair value (see Note 8).
1138118_11_ITEM8_P115_S4	Short-Term Borrowings : The majority of this balance represents our warehouse lines of credit outstanding for CBRE Capital Markets and our revolving credit facility.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P115_S5	Due to the short-term nature and variable interest rates of these instruments, fair value approximates carrying value (see Note 12).
1138118_11_ITEM8_P116_S0	Senior Secured Term Loans : Based upon information from third-party banks, the estimated fair value of our senior secured term loans was approximately $641.8 million at December 31, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P116_S1	Their actual carrying value totaled $640.5 million at December 31, 2010 (see Note 12).
1138118_11_ITEM8_P116_S2	11.625% Senior Subordinated Notes : Based on dealers quotes, the estimated fair value of our 11.625% senior subordinated notes was $508.3 million at December 31, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P116_S3	Their actual carrying value totaled $437.7 million at December 31, 2010 (see Note 12).
1138118_11_ITEM8_P117_S0	6.625% Senior Notes : Based on dealers quotes, the estimated fair value of our 6.625% senior notes was $347.8 million at December 31, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P117_S1	Their actual carrying value totaled $350.0 million at December 31, 2010 (see Note 12).
1138118_11_ITEM8_P117_S2	Notes Payable on Real Estate: As of December 31, 2010, the carrying value of our notes payable on real estate was $627.5 million (see Note 11).
1138118_11_ITEM8_P118_S0	These borrowings mostly have floating interest rates at spreads over a market rate index.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P118_S1	It is likely that some portion of our notes payable on real estate have fair values lower than actual carrying values.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P118_S2	Given our volume of notes payable and the cost involved in estimating their fair value, we determined it was not practicable to do so.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P118_S3	Additionally, only $3.7 million of these notes payable are recourse to us as of December 31, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P119_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment consists of the following (dollars in thousands): Depreciation and amortization expense associated with property and equipment was $58.7 million, $59.4 million and $63.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P120_S0	The following table summarizes the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 (dollars in thousands):
1138118_11_ITEM8_P121_S0	We completed 16 acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of approximately $181 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily in the first half of the year.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P121_S1	The companies we acquired were generally quality regional firms, niche specialty firms that complemented our existing platform within a region, or affiliates in which, in some cases, we held an equity interest.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P121_S2	These included three notable acquisitions within our EMEA segment: the acquisition of Eurisko Consulting SRL, the largest independent commercial real estate services company in Romania, which extends our ability to deliver the premier commercial real estate services offering across Central and Eastern Europe; the acquisition of CB Richard Ellis Cederholm A/S, an affiliate company in Denmark, which significantly strengthens our platform in Scandinavia by giving us a wholly-owned position in one of the region s most active property markets; and the acquisition of Espansione Commerciale, the market leader in shopping centre leasing and property management in Italy, which extends our international retail services capability in that region.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P121_S3	In light of the recent economic environment, no acquisitions were completed in 2009 and 2010, with the exception of a small niche industrial practice in the U.K. that we acquired in the second quarter of 2010 and a small commercial property asset management and consultancy services firm in Hong Kong in the fourth quarter of 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P122_S0	Our annual assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives has historically been completed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P122_S1	We performed the 2010, 2009, and 2008 annual assessments as of October 1.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P122_S2	However, we were required to re-perform the 2008 assessment as of December 31, 2008 because economic conditions worsened, the capital markets became distressed and our stock price dropped significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P122_S3	This was evidenced in our 2008 results by weak sales and leasing activity in our Americas and EMEA segments caused by the credit crunch and significant capital market turmoil, which adversely affected incentive-based revenue within our Global Investment Management segment as well as reduced real estate sales volume and values in our Development Services segment.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P122_S4	Based on our assessments of goodwill in 2008, we determined that we had impairment in several reporting units, which was driven by these adverse economic conditions causing a decline in the estimated future discounted cash flows expected for such units.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P122_S5	The amount of the pre-tax goodwill impairment charges included in our statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $1.1 billion.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P122_S6	When we performed our required annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2010 and 2009, we determined that no impairment existed as the estimated fair value of our reporting units was in excess of their carrying value.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P122_S7	Although economic conditions remained weak for most of 2009 and our full year revenues for 2009 declined when compared to 2008, we did note early signs of an economic recovery taking place in the latter part of 2009, which continued throughout 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P122_S8	This was evidenced by several indicators, including our stock price ($18.13 per share on October 1, 2010 and $10.94 per share on October 1, 2009 versus $4.32 per share at December 31, 2008), a return to positive economic growth in the U.S. in the second half of 2009 and an economic rebound in the Asia Pacific region with transaction activity beginning to revive in late 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P122_S9	These indicators, as well as the benefit of cost reduction measures implemented in the second half of 2008 and in 2009, led to a significant increase in the estimated fair value of the Company s reporting units as of October 1, 2010 and 2009 as compared to the estimated fair value at December 31, 2008.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P122_S10	In addition, the overall size of our goodwill being tested was sharply reduced as a result of the $1.1 billion impairment charge recorded during the year ended December 31, 2008.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P122_S11	This impairment charge included the write-off of goodwill in its entirety in two reporting units that were most severely impacted by the weak economic conditions at that time (i.e. Global Investment Management and Development Services).
1138118_11_ITEM8_P122_S12	If we experience a significant or sustained decline in our future cash flows and/or if the current economic conditions significantly worsen, we may need to perform additional impairment analysis in the future.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P123_S0	CB RICHARD ELLIS GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Other intangible assets totaled $332.9 million and $322.9 million, net of accumulated amortization of $166.3 million and $138.2 million, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and are comprised of the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_11_ITEM8_P124_S0	Trademarks of $56.8 million were separately identified as a result of the 2001 Acquisition.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P124_S1	As a result of the Insignia Acquisition, a $19.8 million trade name was separately identified, which represented the Richard Ellis trade name in the U.K. that was owned by Insignia.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P125_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2008, we determined that two of our intangible assets, $84.0 million representing the Trammell Crow trade name and $6.9 million representing the CBRE Melody trademark, identified as a result of the 2001 Acquisition, were fully impaired.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P125_S1	The impairment of the Trammell Crow trade name was driven by the significant capital market turmoil reducing real estate sales volume and values in our Development Services segment in 2008 and causing a significant decline in the estimated future discounted cash flows such that we could not substantiate this trade name having any book value.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P125_S2	The impairment of the CBRE Melody trademark was driven by our mortgage brokerage business s plans to cease use of the Melody trademark and exclusively use the CBRE trademark.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P125_S3	The amount of the pre-tax other non-amortizable intangible asset impairment charges included in our statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $90.9 million.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P125_S4	We did not record any impairment charges related to intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P125_S5	Our remaining trademark and trade name at December 31, 2010 have indefinite useful lives and accordingly are not being amortized.

1138118_11_ITEM8_P127_S0	Backlog and incentive fees mostly represented the fair value of net revenue backlog and incentive fees acquired as part of the Trammell Crow Company Acquisition as well as other in-fill acquisitions.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P127_S1	These intangible assets were amortized over useful lives of up to one year.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P128_S0	CB RICHARD ELLIS GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Management contracts consist primarily of property management contracts in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and France, as well as valuation services and fund management contracts in the U.K.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P128_S1	These management contracts are being amortized over useful lives of up to ten years.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P129_S0	Loan servicing rights represent the fair value of servicing assets in our mortgage brokerage line of business in the U.S.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P129_S1	The loan servicing rights are being amortized over the useful lives of the underlying loans, which are generally up to ten years.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P129_S2	Other amortizable intangible assets mainly represent transition costs as well as other intangible assets acquired as a result of the Trammell Crow Company Acquisition and the Insignia Acquisition.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P129_S3	Other intangible assets are being amortized over useful lives of up to 20 years.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P129_S4	Amortization expense related to intangible assets was $23.1 million, $19.6 million and $20.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P129_S5	The estimated annual amortization expense for each of the years ending December 31, 2011 through December 31, 2015 approximates $25.5 million, $23.1 million, $21.8 million, $20.6 million and $19.3 million, respectively.

1138118_11_ITEM8_P149_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2008, commercial real estate fundamentals in the U.S. weakened significantly, impacted by the overall downturn in the economy as evidenced by the decline in the U.S. Gross Domestic Product and a high rate of unemployment.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P149_S1	Market fundamentals in the primary product types which we develop/own weakened significantly.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P149_S2	The high unemployment rate negatively impacted office markets as companies deferred occupancy decisions and placed space on the market for sublease.

1138118_11_ITEM8_P149_S4	The retail sector was negatively affected by declining sales and retailers experiencing financial difficulty.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P149_S5	Transactions declined significantly due to illiquidity in the capital markets as many lenders tightened lending standards for commercial real estate.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P149_S6	Capitalization rates increased as potential buyers of commercial real estate re-evaluated commercial real estate versus other asset classes available for investment.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P150_S0	At the time we performed our real estate impairment analyses for the year ended December 31, 2008, the assumptions utilized reflected our outlook for the commercial real estate industry and the impact on our business.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P150_S1	This outlook incorporated our belief that market conditions deteriorated and that these challenging conditions could persist for some time.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P151_S0	In 2008, projects with a combined carrying value of $542.1 million as of December 31, 2008, had indicators of potential impairment and were evaluated for impairment.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P151_S1	Through the evaluation process, it was determined that projects with a carrying value of $157.8 million were impaired.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P151_S2	As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded impairment charges of $48.7 million to reduce the carrying value of the impaired real estate projects to their estimated fair value, $35.5 million of which were attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P152_S0	In June 2009, upon substantial completion of a real estate project under development, one of our consolidated subsidiaries assigned its assets and liabilities (and contributed $0.5 million) to an entity controlled and owned 60% by a third party.

1138118_11_ITEM8_P187_S0	We have concluded our previously disclosed internal investigation relating to activities by some of our employees in certain of our offices in China that raised issues with respect to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P187_S1	The U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have also closed their review of such matters without any action.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P188_S0	Our leases generally relate to office space that we occupy, have varying terms and expire through 2030.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P188_S1	The following is a schedule by year of future minimum lease payments for noncancellable operating leases as of December 31, 2010 (dollars in thousands): Total minimum payments for noncancellable operating leases were not reduced by the minimum sublease rental income of $13.5 million due in the future under noncancellable subleases.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P189_S0	Substantially all leases require us to pay maintenance costs, insurance and property taxes.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P189_S1	The composition of total rental expense under noncancellable operating leases consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_11_ITEM8_P190_S0	subsidiaries outstanding reserves for claims under certain insurance programs as well as letters of credit related to operating leases.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P190_S1	These letters of credit are primarily executed by us in the normal course of business as well as in connection with certain insurance programs.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P190_S2	The letters of credit expire at varying dates through December 2011.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P190_S3	We had guarantees totaling $10.8 million as of December 31, 2010, excluding guarantees related to pension liabilities, consolidated indebtedness and other obligations for which we have outstanding liabilities already accrued on our consolidated balance sheet as well as operating leases.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P190_S4	The $10.8 million primarily consists of guarantees of obligations of unconsolidated subsidiaries, which expire at varying dates through November 2013.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P190_S5	In addition, as of December 31, 2010, we had numerous completion and budget guarantees relating to development projects.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P190_S6	These guarantees are made by us in the normal course of our Development Services business.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P190_S7	Each of these guarantees requires us to complete construction of the relevant project within a specified timeframe and/or within a specified budget, with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P190_S8	However, we generally have guaranteed maximum price contracts with reputable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P190_S9	These contracts are intended to pass the risk to such contractors.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P190_S10	While there can be no assurance, we do not expect to incur any material losses under these guarantees.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P191_S0	From time to time, we act as a general contractor with respect to construction projects.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P191_S1	We do not consider these activities to be a material part of our business.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P191_S2	In connection with these activities, we seek to subcontract construction work for certain projects to reputable subcontractors.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P191_S3	Should construction defects arise relating to the underlying projects, we could potentially be liable to the client for the costs to repair such defects, although we would generally look to the subcontractor that performed the work to remedy the defect and also look to insurance policies that cover this work.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P191_S4	While there can be no assurance, we do not expect to incur material losses with respect to construction defects.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P192_S0	In January 2008, CBRE Multifamily Capital, Inc. (CBRE MCI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBRE Capital Markets, Inc., entered into an agreement with Fannie Mae, under Fannie Mae s DUS Lender Program (DUS Program), to provide financing for multifamily housing with five or more units.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P192_S1	Under the DUS Program, CBRE MCI originates, underwrites, closes and services loans without prior approval by Fannie Mae, and in selected cases, is subject to sharing up to one-third of any losses on loans originated under the DUS Program.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P192_S2	CBRE MCI has funded loans subject to such loss sharing arrangements with unpaid principal balances of $2.1 billion at December 31, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P192_S3	Additionally, CBRE MCI has funded loans under the DUS Program that are not subject to loss sharing arrangements with unpaid principal balances of approximately $435.3 million at December 31, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P193_S0	CBRE MCI, under its agreement with Fannie Mae, must post cash reserves under formulas established by Fannie Mae to provide for sufficient capital in the event losses occur.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P193_S1	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, CBRE MCI had $2.2 million and $1.2 million, respectively, of cash deposited under this reserve arrangement, and had provided approximately $4.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively, of loan loss accruals.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P193_S2	Fannie Mae s recourse under the DUS Program is limited to the assets of CBRE MCI, which totaled approximately $169.0 million at December 31, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P194_S0	An important part of the strategy for our Global Investment Management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P194_S1	These co-investments typically range from 2% to 5% of the equity in a particular fund.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P194_S2	As of December 31, 2010, we had aggregate commitments of $11.5 million to fund future co-investments.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P194_S3	Additionally, an important part of our Development Services business strategy is to invest in unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries as a principal (in most cases co-investing with our clients).
1138118_11_ITEM8_P194_S4	As of December 31, 2010, we had committed to fund $22.0 million of additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P195_S0	Employee Benefit Plans Stock Incentive Plans 2001 Stock Incentive Plan.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P195_S1	Our 2001 stock incentive plan was adopted by our board of directors and approved by our stockholders on June 7, 2001.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P195_S2	However, our 2001 stock incentive plan was terminated in June 2004 in connection with the adoption of our 2004 stock incentive plan, which is described below.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P195_S3	The 2001 stock incentive plan permitted the grant of nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards to our employees, directors or independent contractors.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P195_S4	Since our 2001 stock incentive plan has been terminated, no shares remain available for issuance under it.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P195_S5	However, as of December 31, 2010, outstanding stock options granted under the 2001 stock incentive plan to acquire 3,517,947 shares of our Class A common stock remain outstanding according to their terms, and we will continue to issue shares to the extent required under the terms of such outstanding awards.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P195_S6	Options granted under this plan have an exercise price of $1.92.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P195_S7	As of December 31, 2009, all options granted under this plan were fully vested and exercisable.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P196_S0	Options granted under the 2001 stock incentive plan are subject to a maximum term of ten years from the date of grant.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P197_S0	The number of shares issued pursuant to the 2001 stock incentive plan, or pursuant to outstanding awards, is subject to adjustment on account of stock splits, stock dividends and other dilutive changes in our Class A common stock.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P198_S0	Second Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P198_S1	Our 2004 stock incentive plan was adopted by our board of directors and approved by our stockholders on April 21, 2004, and has been amended several times subsequently, including an amendment and restatement on June 2, 2008 and an amendment on December 3, 2008.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P198_S2	The 2004 stock incentive plan authorizes the grant of stock-based awards to our employees, directors or independent contractors.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P198_S3	A total of 20,785,218 shares of our Class A common stock initially were reserved for issuance under the 2004 stock incentive plan, which increased by 10,000,000 shares to a total of 30,785,218 shares in connection with the June 2, 2008 amendment and restatement.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P198_S4	For awards granted prior to June 2, 2008 under this plan, this share reserve was reduced by one share upon grant of an option or stock appreciation right, and was reduced by 2.25 shares upon issuance of stock pursuant to other stock-based awards.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P198_S5	For awards granted on or after June 2, 2008 under this plan, this share reserve is reduced by one share upon grant of all awards.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P198_S6	In addition, full value awards, i.e., awards other than stock options and stock appreciation rights, are limited to no more than 75% of the total share reserve.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P198_S7	Awards that expire, terminate or lapse will again be available for grant under this plan.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P198_S8	No person is eligible to be granted awards in the aggregate covering more than 2,000,000 shares during any fiscal year.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P199_S0	The number of shares issued or reserved pursuant to the 2004 stock incentive plan, or pursuant to outstanding awards, is subject to adjustment on account of mergers, consolidations, reorganizations, stock splits, stock dividends and other dilutive changes in our common stock.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P199_S1	In addition, our board of directors may adjust outstanding awards to preserve the awards benefits or potential benefits.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P200_S0	Stock Option Exchange On July 9, 2009, we completed a stock option exchange program (Exchange Offer) under which eligible employees tendered, and we accepted for cancellation, eligible options to purchase 2,599,307 shares of our Class A common stock.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P200_S1	We granted new options to eligible employees to purchase 103,361 shares of our Class A common stock and issued 819,672 restricted shares of our Class A common stock in exchange for the cancellation of the tendered eligible options.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P200_S2	The exercise price per share of the new options granted in the Exchange Offer was $8.09, the closing price of our common stock on July 9, 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P200_S3	The new options and restricted shares issued will vest and are exercisable in equal annual increments over four years from the date of grant.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P200_S4	This Exchange Offer did not result in any incremental compensation expense as the estimated fair value of the new awards did not exceed the estimated fair value of the exchanged stock options immediately prior to the exchange.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P201_S0	CB RICHARD ELLIS GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Stock Options As of December 31, 2010, 3,118,533 shares were subject to options issued under our 2004 stock incentive plan and 5,183,250 shares remained available for future grants under the 2004 stock incentive plan.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P202_S0	Options granted under this plan during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 have exercise prices in the ranges of $14.88 to $16.48, $8.09 to $11.45 and $13.29 to $22.00, respectively, which primarily vest and are exercisable generally in equal annual increments over four years from the date of grant.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P202_S1	All options that have been granted under the 2004 stock incentive plan have a term of five or seven years from the date of grant.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P202_S2	A summary of the status of our outstanding stock options is presented in the tables below:
1138118_11_ITEM8_P203_S0	(3) The expected to vest options are the result of applying the pre-vesting forfeiture rate assumption to total outstanding options.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P204_S0	We estimate the fair value of our options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which takes into account assumptions such as the dividend yield, the risk-free interest rate, the expected stock price volatility and the expected life of the options.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P205_S0	The total estimated grant date fair value of stock options that vested during the year ended December 31, 2010 was $3.5 million.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P205_S1	The weighted average fair value of options granted by us was $10.40, $6.63 and $6.58 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P205_S2	The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, utilizing the following weighted average assumptions:
1138118_11_ITEM8_P206_S0	The dividend yield assumption is excluded from the calculation, as it is our present intention to retain all earnings.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P206_S1	The expected volatility is based on a combination of our historical stock price and implied volatility.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P206_S2	The selection of implied volatility data to estimate expected volatility is based upon the availability of actively traded options on our stock.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P206_S3	The risk-free interest rate is based upon the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the options.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P206_S4	The expected life of our stock options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is based on historical experience of similar options, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P207_S0	Option valuation models require the input of subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility and expected life.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P207_S1	Because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, we do not believe that the Black-Scholes model necessarily provides a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P208_S0	Options outstanding at December 31, 2010 and their related weighted average exercise price, intrinsic value and life information is presented below: At December 31, 2010, the aggregate intrinsic value and weighted average remaining contractual life for options vested and expected to vest were $86.3 million and 2.9 years, respectively.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P208_S1	Total compensation expense related to stock options was $3.7 million, $7.4 million and $11.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P209_S0	estimated compensation cost related to non-vested stock options was approximately $6.3 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.9 years.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P209_S1	The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $14.5 million, $11.4 million and $12.4 million, respectively.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P209_S2	We recorded cash received from stock option exercises of $2.4 million, $15.4 million and $4.0 million and related tax benefit of $5.4 million, $1.6 million and $4.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P210_S0	Upon option exercise, we issue new shares of stock.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P211_S0	Excess tax benefits exist when the tax deduction resulting from the exercise of options exceeds the compensation cost recorded.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P212_S0	Non-Vested Stock Awards We have issued non-vested stock awards, including shares and stock units, in our Class A common stock to certain of our employees and members of our board of directors.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P212_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we granted non-vested stock awards of 1,196,720 shares, 6,711,288 shares and 2,371,987 shares, respectively, which primarily vest and are exercisable generally in equal annual increments over four years from the date of grant.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P212_S2	We also granted 759,992, 54,344 and 529,907 of non-vested stock units to certain of our employees during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P212_S3	These non-vested stock units primarily vest in 2015 and 2016.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P212_S4	A summary of the status of our non-vested stock awards is presented in the table below:
1138118_11_ITEM8_P213_S0	Total compensation expense related to non-vested stock awards was $43.1 million, $30.5 million and $18.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P213_S1	At December 31, 2010, total unrecognized estimated compensation cost related to non-vested stock awards was approximately $106.6 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 3.0 years.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P214_S0	We have bonus programs covering select employees, including senior management.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P214_S1	Awards are based on the position and performance of the employee and the achievement of pre-established financial, operating and strategic objectives.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P214_S2	The amounts charged to expense for bonuses were $135.0 million, $60.6 million and $66.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P215_S0	CB RICHARD ELLIS GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 401(k) Plan.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P216_S0	Our CB Richard Ellis 401(k) Plan (401(k) Plan) is a defined contribution profit sharing plan that allows participant deferrals under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P216_S1	Most of our non-union U.S. employees, other than qualified real estate agents having the status of independent contractors under section 3508 of the Internal Revenue Code, are eligible to participate in the plan.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P216_S2	The 401(k) Plan provides for participant contributions as well as a Company match.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P216_S3	A participant is allowed to contribute to the 401(k) Plan from 1% to 75% of his or her compensation, subject to limits imposed by applicable law.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P216_S4	Effective January 1, 2007, all participants hired post January 1, 2007 vest in company match contributions 20% per year for each plan year they work 1,000 hours.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P216_S5	All participants hired before January 1, 2007 are immediately vested in company match contributions.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P216_S6	For 2008, we contributed a 50% match on the first 3% of annual compensation (up to $150,000 of compensation) deferred by each participant.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P216_S7	Effective January 1, 2009, the company match was suspended.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P216_S8	However, we will be making a partial retroactive match for 2010 401(k) participants who were employed at December 31, 2010, which is included in the $2.7 million expense for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P216_S9	In connection with the 401(k) Plan, we charged to expense $2.7 million, $0.7 million and $9.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P217_S0	Participants are entitled to invest up to 25% of their 401(k) account balance in shares of our common stock.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P217_S1	As of December 31, 2010, approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock were held as investments by participants in our 401(k) Plan.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P218_S0	We have two contributory defined benefit pension plans in the U.K.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P218_S1	The London-based firm of Hillier Parker May Rowden, which we acquired in 1998, had a contributory defined benefit pension plan.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P218_S2	A subsidiary of Insignia, which we acquired in connection with the Insignia Acquisition in 2003, also had a contributory defined benefit pension plan in the U.K.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P218_S3	Our subsidiaries based in the U.K. maintain the plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in these plans.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P218_S4	With respect to these plans, our historical policy has been to contribute annually an amount to fund pension cost as actuarially determined and as required by applicable laws and regulations.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P218_S5	Effective July 1, 2007, we reached agreements with the active members of these plans to freeze future pension plan benefits.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P218_S6	In return, the active members became eligible to enroll in a defined contribution plan.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P219_S0	We previously used a measurement date of September 30 for both of our defined benefit pension plans.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P219_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2008, as required by the Compensation Retirement Benefits Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 715), we adopted the measurement date provisions, which required us to measure the funded status of our plans as of the date of our fiscal year-end statement of financial position.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P219_S2	We used the alternative method of adoption for both of our plans.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P219_S3	In connection with this adoption, during the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded an increase in retained earnings of $0.2 million and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $0.1 million, net of tax, representing the estimated periodic pension benefit for the period from October 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P220_S0	obligation, plan assets, plan s funded status and amounts recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets for both of our defined benefit pension plans (dollars in thousands):
1138118_11_ITEM8_P221_S0	The accumulated benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans was $296.6 million and $304.9 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P221_S1	Items not yet recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost were as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_11_ITEM8_P222_S0	The estimated net actuarial loss that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic pension cost in 2011 is $1.3 million.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P223_S0	CB RICHARD ELLIS GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Components of net periodic pension cost (benefit) and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive (income) loss consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_11_ITEM8_P224_S0	Weighted average assumptions used to determine our projected benefit obligation were as follows:
1138118_11_ITEM8_P224_S1	Weighted average assumptions used to determine our net periodic pension cost (benefit) were as follows: We select a discount rate by reference to yields available at our balance sheet date on U.K. AA-rated corporate bonds.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P225_S0	The corporate bond yield curve is derived by taking a government bond yield curve, based on Bank of England data and adding an amount to reflect the yield spread on AA-rated bonds over government bonds.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P225_S1	This discount rate selected is the weighted average of the yields on the resulting bond yield curve, where the weighting is based on the expected cash flow from the weighted average duration of the pension plans.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P226_S0	We review historical rates of return for equity and fixed income securities, as well as current economic conditions, to determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P226_S1	The assumed rate of return for 2010 is based on 67.7% of the portfolio being invested in equities yielding a 7.5% return and 21.4% of assets being primarily invested in corporate and government debt securities yielding a 5.0% return.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P226_S2	Consideration is given to diversification and periodic rebalancing of the portfolio based on prevailing market conditions.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P227_S0	Our pension plan weighted average asset allocations by asset category were as follows:
1138118_11_ITEM8_P228_S0	Our pension trust assets are invested with a long-term focus to achieve a return on investment that is based on levels of liquidity and investment risk that the trustees, in consultation with management believe are prudent and reasonable.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P228_S1	The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income and index linked investments consisting primarily of government debt.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P228_S2	The equity investments are diversified across U.K. and non-U.K. equities, as well as value, growth, and medium and large capitalizations.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P228_S3	The portfolio s asset mix is reviewed regularly, and the portfolio is rebalanced based on existing market conditions.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P228_S4	Investment risk is measured and monitored on a regular basis through quarterly portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements and periodic asset/liability analyses.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P228_S5	The fair value of our pension assets are comprised of the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_11_ITEM8_P229_S0	(a) The assets in this category represent investments in foreign equity and bond funds.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P229_S1	Generally, these assets are valued using bid-market valuations provided by the funds investment managers.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P230_S0	(b) The assets in this category include investments in a liability driven investment fund and investments in commercial real estate.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P230_S1	The liability driven investment fund is a single priced fund and the fair value of the underlying assets are priced by the fund s custodian based on observable market data and therefore categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P231_S0	The investments in commercial real estate include investments in a pooled property fund and a property unit trust that invest in commercial real estate properties in the U.K.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P231_S1	The fair values for these investments are based on inputs obtained from broker quotes that are indicative of value and cannot be corroborated by observable market data and therefore are categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P232_S0	CB RICHARD ELLIS GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) A summary of our pension assets measured and recorded using significant unobservable inputs is as follows (dollars in thousands): We expect to contribute $3.6 million to our pension plans in 2011.

1138118_11_ITEM8_P233_S0	We also have defined contribution plans for employees in the U.K.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P233_S1	Our contributions to these plans were approximately $7.3 million, $8.6 million and $7.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P234_S0	The components of income (loss) from continuing operations before provision for income taxes consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_11_ITEM8_P235_S0	Our tax provision (benefit) consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_11_ITEM8_P236_S0	The following is a reconciliation stated as a percentage of pre-tax income (loss) of the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate:
1138118_11_ITEM8_P236_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, we recorded a $5.6 million, $3.5 million and $4.7 million income tax benefit in connection with stock options exercised.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P236_S2	Of this income tax benefit, $5.4 million, $1.6 million and $4.3 million was charged directly to additional paid-in capital within the equity section of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P237_S0	CB RICHARD ELLIS GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Cumulative tax effects of temporary differences are shown below at December 31, 2010 and 2009 (dollars in thousands):
1138118_11_ITEM8_P238_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we had U.S. federal net operating losses (NOLs) of approximately $4.1 million, translating to a deferred tax asset before valuation allowance of $1.4 million, which will begin to expire in 2023.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P238_S1	As of December 31, 2010, there were also deferred tax assets of approximately $17.0 million related to state NOLs as well as $32.4 million related to foreign NOLs.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P238_S2	The state NOLs begin to expire in 2011, and the foreign NOLs begin to expire in 2013.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P239_S0	The utilization of NOLs may be subject to certain limitations under U.S. federal, state and foreign laws.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P239_S1	Management determined that as of December 31, 2010, $41.1 million of deferred tax assets do not satisfy the recognition criteria set forth in Topic 740.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P239_S2	Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been recorded for this amount.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P239_S3	If released, the entire amount would result in a benefit to continuing operations.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P239_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2010, our valuation allowances decreased by approximately $1.1 million.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P239_S5	This was primarily the result of establishing valuation allowances of $4.9 million related to foreign net operating losses and other foreign assets, $0.6 million related to state net operating losses and $2.5 million related to other state assets.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P239_S6	These increases were more than offset by decreases of $3.6 million related to foreign net operating loss adjustments, $2.9 million related to the reversal of valuation allowances on assets disposed of and $2.6 million related to the utilization of foreign net operating losses.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P239_S7	Management believes it is more likely than not that future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets recorded net of these valuation allowances.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P239_S8	Presently, we have not recorded a deferred tax liability for undistributed earnings of subsidiaries located outside of the U.S.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P239_S9	These earnings may become taxable upon a payment of a dividend or as a result of a sale or liquidation of the subsidiaries.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P239_S10	At this time, we do not have any plans to repatriate income from our foreign subsidiaries, however, to the extent that we are able to repatriate such earnings in a tax free manner, or in the event of a change in our capital situation or investment strategy, it is possible that the foreign subsidiaries may pay a dividend which would impact our effective tax rate.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P239_S11	Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which have been, or are intended to be permanently invested, aggregated approximately $990.7 million at December 31, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P239_S12	The determination of the tax liability upon repatriation is not practicable.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P240_S0	The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $77.2 million and $69.2 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P240_S1	The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect our effective tax rate, if recognized, is $39.1 million ($37.9 million, net of federal benefit received from state positions) and $36.8 million ($34.9 million, net of federal benefit received from state positions) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P240_S2	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 is as follows (dollars in thousands): We currently anticipate a decrease of $1.1 million to unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months due to expiration of the statute of limitations relative to several immaterial items.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P240_S3	Our continuing practice is to recognize potential accrued interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters within income tax expense.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P240_S4	During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we accrued an additional $2.9 million, $2.8 million and $3.4 million, respectively, in interest associated with uncertain tax positions.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P240_S5	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we have recognized a liability for interest and penalties of $23.7 million ($19.5 million, net of related federal benefit received from interest expense) and $22.5 million ($19.1 million, net of related federal benefit received from interest expense), respectively.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P241_S0	We conduct business globally and, as a result, one or more of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and multiple state, local and foreign jurisdictions.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P241_S1	We are no longer subject to U.S. federal Internal Revenue Service audits for years prior to 2005.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P241_S2	With limited exception, our significant state and foreign tax jurisdictions are no longer subject to audit by the various tax authorities for tax years prior to 2003.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P242_S0	On June 4, 2009, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation that increased the total number of shares of Class A common stock that we are authorized to issue from 325,000,000 to 525,000,000, with $0.01 par value per share.

1138118_11_ITEM8_P244_S1	On June 10, 2009, we completed the sale of 13,440,860 shares of our Class A common stock through a direct placement to Paulson Co. Inc., which raised approximately $97.6 million of net proceeds.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P244_S2	On June 11, 2009, we completed the sale of 5,682,684 shares of our Class A common stock through an at-the-market offering program, which raised approximately $48.8 million of net proceeds.

1138118_11_ITEM8_P246_S0	diluted earnings per share as their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P246_S1	Additionally, had we reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2008, 4,028,886 of contingently issuable shares would have been included in the computation of diluted earnings per share, while 609,657 of contingently issuable shares would have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share as their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P247_S0	The accompanying consolidated balance sheets do not include the net assets of escrow, agency and fiduciary funds, which are held by us on behalf of clients and which amounted to $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P248_S0	Discontinued Operations In the ordinary course of business, we dispose of real estate assets, or hold real estate assets for sale, that may be considered components of an entity in accordance with Topic 360.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P248_S1	If we do not have, or expect to have, significant continuing involvement with the operation of these real estate assets after disposition, we are required to recognize operating profits or losses and gains or losses on disposition of these assets as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations in the periods in which they occur.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P248_S2	We did not report any discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P248_S3	Real estate operations and dispositions accounted for as discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2008 were reported in our Development Services segment as follows (dollars in thousands):

1138118_11_ITEM8_P252_S1	Our Development Services business consists of real estate development and investment activities primarily in the U.S. Summarized financial information by segment is as follows (dollars in thousands): EBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and goodwill and other non-amortizable intangible asset impairment.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P253_S0	charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P253_S1	Such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P253_S2	As a result, our management uses EBITDA as a measure to evaluate the operating performance of our various business segments and for other discretionary purposes, including as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive programs.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P253_S3	Additionally, we believe EBITDA is useful to investors to assist them in getting a more accurate picture of our results from operations.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P253_S4	However, EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and when analyzing our operating performance, readers should use EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P253_S5	Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P253_S6	Furthermore, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management s discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P253_S7	The amounts shown for EBITDA also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P253_S8	Net interest expense, write-off of financing costs and goodwill and other non-amortizable intangible asset impairment have been expensed in the segment incurred.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P254_S0	Provision for (benefit of) income taxes has been allocated among our segments by using applicable U.S. and foreign effective tax rates.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P254_S1	EBITDA for our segments is calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):

1138118_11_ITEM8_P264_S4	In addition, we expect to incur transaction costs relating to the acquisitions of approximately $150 million (pre-tax), including financing, retention and integration costs.
1138118_11_ITEM8_P264_S5	The acquisitions are expected to close in the second half of 2011 and are subject to approval by certain stakeholders, including regulatory agencies in the U.S., Europe and Asia.

1138118_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Securities Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f), including maintenance of (i) records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets, and (ii) policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance that (a) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, (b) our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our Board of Directors and (c) we will prevent or timely detect unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1138118_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control.
1138118_11_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses of judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.
1138118_11_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper overriding of controls.
1138118_11_ITEM9A_P1_S3	As a result of such limitations, there is risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
1138118_11_ITEM9A_P1_S4	However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
1138118_11_ITEM9A_P1_S5	Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
1138118_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission.
1138118_11_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Based on our evaluation under the COSO framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2010.
1138118_11_ITEM9A_P2_S2	The effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

1138118_11_ITEM15_P69_S0	EXHIBIT 32 WRITTEN STATEMENT PURSUANT TO 18 U.S.C. SECTION 1350 The undersigned, Brett White, Chief Executive Officer, and Gil Borok, Chief Financial Officer of CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc. (the Company ), hereby certify as of the date hereof, solely for the purposes of 18 U.S.C. 1350, that: (i) the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2010, of the Company (the Report ) fully complies with the requirements of Section 13(a) and 15(d), as applicable, of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and (ii) the information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company at the dates and for the periods indicated.
1138118_11_ITEM15_P70_S0	The foregoing certification is being furnished solely pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 1350 and is not being filed as part of the Report or as a separate disclosure document.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P0_S0	CBRE Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation formerly known as CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc., (which may be referred to in this Form 10-K as the company , we , us and our ) is the world s largest commercial real estate services firm, based on 2011 revenue, with leading full-service operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P0_S1	We offer a full range of services to occupiers, owners, lenders and investors in office, retail, industrial, multi-family and other types of commercial real estate.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P0_S2	As of December 31, 2011, we operated more than 300 offices worldwide, excluding affiliate offices, with approximately 34,000 employees providing commercial real estate services under the CBRE brand name, investment management services under the CBRE Global Investors brand name and development services under the Trammell Crow brand name.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P0_S3	Our business is focused on several competencies, including commercial property and corporate facilities management, occupier and property/agency leasing, property sales, valuation, real estate investment management, commercial mortgage origination and servicing, capital markets (equity and debt) solutions, development services and proprietary research.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P0_S4	We generate revenues from contractual management fees and on a per project or transactional basis.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P0_S5	Our contractual, fee-for-services businesses, which generally involve facilities management, property management, mortgage loan servicing and investment management, represented approximately 39% of our 2011 revenue.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P0_S6	During the year ended December 31, 2011, we generated revenue from a well-balanced, highly diversified base of clients that includes approximately 80 of the Fortune 100 companies.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P0_S7	We estimate that the following client types accounted for the highest proportion of revenue in 2011:
1138118_12_ITEM1_P1_S0	The following client types accounted for the remainder of our revenue:
1138118_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	Property owners, occupiers and investors continue to consolidate their service needs with fewer providers, and are awarding their business to firms that have strong capabilities in leading markets and the ability to provide a complete range of services.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P2_S1	We believe we are well positioned to capture a growing and disproportionate share of the business being awarded as a result of these trends.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P2_S2	In 2011, we were the highest ranked commercial real estate services company among the Fortune Most Admired Companies, and achieved the highest brand reputation ranking among all commercial real estate companies in a survey of Wall Street Journal subscribers.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P2_S3	Since 2006, we have been the only commercial real estate services company included in the S P 500.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P2_S4	In every year since 2008, we have been the only commercial real estate services firm to be included in the Fortune 500 .
1138118_12_ITEM1_P2_S5	Additionally, the International Association of Outsourcing Professionals has included us among the top 100 global outsourcing companies across all industries for five consecutive years, including in 2011, when we ranked 6th overall and were the highest ranked commercial real estate services company.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	CBRE History CBRE marked its 105 th year of continuous operations in 2011, tracing our origins to a company founded in San Francisco in the aftermath of the 1906 earthquake.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P3_S1	Since then, we have grown into the largest global commercial real estate services firm (in terms of 2011 revenue) through organic growth and a series of strategic acquisitions, including the December 2006 purchase of Trammell Crow Company, which significantly deepened our outsourcing service offerings, and the 2011 REIM Acquisitions described below.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P3_S2	In 2011, we completed a series of strategic transactions with Netherlands-based ING Group N.V. and its affiliates (ING), which bolstered our global real estate investment management business.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P3_S3	We acquired substantially all of ING s Real Estate Investment Management (REIM) operations in Europe and Asia, and its U.S.-based global real estate listed securities business, Clarion Real Estate Securities (CRES), for over $810 million in cash (which we refer to as the REIM Acquisitions).
1138118_12_ITEM1_P3_S4	In addition, we acquired co-investment interests totaling approximately $80 million.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P3_S5	These former ING businesses are now part of our independently operated Global Investment Management segment, which conducts business through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, CBRE Global Investors.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	The REIM and CRES businesses are highly complementary, with little overlap in client base and different investment strategies.

1138118_12_ITEM1_P7_S1	These in-fill acquisitions remain an integral part of our long-term strategy.

1138118_12_ITEM1_P10_S1	Our operations are largely wholly-owned, but also include independent affiliated offices, which license the use of the CBRE and CB Richard Ellis names in their local markets in return for payments of annual royalty fees to us and an agreement to cross-refer business between us and the affiliate.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P10_S2	Most of our operations are conducted through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE, Inc.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P10_S3	Our mortgage loan origination, sales and servicing operations are conducted exclusively through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary operating under the name CBRE Capital Markets and its subsidiaries.

1138118_12_ITEM1_P11_S1	Within our Americas segment, we organize our services into the following business areas:
1138118_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	Our advisory services businesses offer occupier/tenant and investor/owner services that meet the full spectrum of marketplace needs, including (1) real estate services, (2) capital markets and (3) valuation.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	Our advisory services business line accounted for 34.5% of our 2011 consolidated worldwide revenue, 35.0% of our 2010 consolidated worldwide revenue and 30.8% of our 2009 consolidated worldwide revenue.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P12_S2	Within advisory services, our major service lines are the following:
1138118_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	We provide strategic advice and execution to owners, investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with leasing, disposition and acquisition of property.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P13_S1	Our years of strong local market presence have allowed us to develop significant repeat business from existing clients, including approximately 53% of our revenues from existing U.S. real estate sales and leasing clients in 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P13_S2	This includes referrals from our contractual fee-for-services businesses, such as facilities and property management, mortgage loan servicing and investment management provided by CBRE Global Investors.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P13_S3	Our real estate services professionals are particularly adept at aligning real estate strategies with client business objectives, serving as advisors as well as transaction executors.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P13_S4	We believe we are a market leader for the provision of sales and leasing real estate services in most top U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau), including Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, New York and Philadelphia.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P13_S5	Our real estate services professionals are compensated primarily through commission-based programs, which are payable upon completion of an assignment.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P13_S6	Therefore, as compensation is our largest expense, this cost structure gives us flexibility to mitigate the negative effect on our operating margins during difficult market conditions.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	Due to the low barriers to entry and significant competition for quality employees, we strive to retain top professionals through an attractive compensation program tied to productivity.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P14_S1	We believe we invest in greater support resources than most other firms, including professional development and training, market research and information, technology, branding and marketing.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P14_S2	We also foster an entrepreneurial culture that emphasizes client service and rewards performance.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P14_S3	We further strengthen our relationships with our real estate services clients by offering proprietary research to them through our commercial real estate market information and forecasting unit, CBRE Econometric Advisors (CBRE-EA).
1138118_12_ITEM1_P14_S4	This group provides data and analysis to its clients in various formats, including market outlook reports for the office, industrial, hotel, retail and multi-housing sectors, covering more than 125 metropolitan areas in the United States and Canada.

1138118_12_ITEM1_P16_S2	We believe our Investment Properties business, which includes office, industrial, retail, multi-family and hotel properties, is the leading investment sales property advisor in the United States, with a market share of approximately 16% in 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	Our mortgage brokerage business originates, sells and services commercial mortgage loans primarily through relationships established with investment banking firms, national banks, credit companies, insurance companies, pension funds and government agencies.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P17_S1	In the United States, our mortgage loan origination volume in 2011 was $16.5 billion, representing an increase of approximately 72% from 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P17_S2	Approximately $6.2 billion of loans in 2011 were originated for federal government sponsored entities, most of which were financed through revolving credit lines dedicated exclusively for this purpose.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P17_S3	We substantially mitigate the principal risk associated with loans financed through these credit lines by either obtaining a contractual purchase commitment from the government-sponsored entity or confirming a forward-trade commitment for the issuance and purchase of a mortgage-backed security that will be secured by the loan.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P17_S4	We advised on the sale of approximately $2.8 billion of mortgages on behalf of financial institutions in 2011, compared with $4.5 billion in 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P17_S5	In 2011, GEMSA Loan Services, a joint venture between CBRE Capital Markets and GE Capital Real Estate, serviced approximately $103.6 billion of mortgage loans, $57.7 billion of which related to the servicing rights of CBRE Capital Markets.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	We provide valuation services that include market value appraisals, litigation support, discounted cash flow analyses and feasibility and fairness opinions.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	Our valuation business has developed proprietary technology for preparing and delivering valuation reports to our clients, which we believe provides us with an advantage over our competitors.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P19_S1	We believe that our valuation business is one of the largest in the industry.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P19_S2	During 2011, we completed over 34,000 valuation, appraisal and advisory assignments.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	Outsourcing Services Outsourcing commercial real estate services is a long-term trend in our industry, with corporations, institutions, public sector entities, health care providers and others seeking to achieve improved efficiency, better execution and lower costs by relying on the expertise of third-party real estate specialists.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P20_S1	Our outsourcing services primarily include two major business lines that seek to capitalize on this trend: (1) corporate services and (2) asset services.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	Agreements with our corporate services clients are generally long-term arrangements and although they contain different provisions for termination, there are usually penalties for early termination.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P21_S1	Although our management agreements with our asset services clients generally may be terminated with notice ranging between 30 to 90 days, we have developed long-term relationships with many of these clients and we continue to work closely with them to implement their specific goals and objectives and to preserve and expand upon these relationships.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P21_S2	As of December 31, 2011, we managed approximately 1.4 billion square feet of commercial space for property owners and occupiers, which we believe represents one of the largest portfolios in the Americas.

1138118_12_ITEM1_P24_S1	We identify best practices, implement technology solutions and leverage our resources to control clients facilities costs and enhance the workplace environment.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	The long-term, contractual nature of these relationships enables us to devise and execute real estate strategies that support our clients overall business strategies.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	Revenues for project management include fixed management fees, variable fees, and incentive fees if certain agreed-upon performance targets are met.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P26_S1	Revenues may also include reimbursement of payroll and related costs for personnel providing the services.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P26_S2	Contracts for facilities management services are typically structured so we receive reimbursement of client-dedicated personnel costs and associated overhead expenses plus a monthly fee, and in some cases, annual incentives if agreed-upon performance targets are satisfied.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	We provide property management, construction management, marketing, leasing, accounting and financial services on a contractual basis for income-producing office, industrial and retail properties owned by local, regional and institutional investors.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P27_S1	We provide these services through an extensive network of real estate experts in major markets throughout the United States.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P27_S2	These local office teams are supported by a strategic accounts team whose function is to help ensure quality service and to maintain and expand relationships with large institutional clients, including buyers, sellers and landlords who need to lease, buy, sell and/or finance space.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P27_S3	We believe our contractual relationships with these clients put us in an advantageous position to provide other services to them, including refinancing, disposition and appraisal.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	We typically receive monthly management fees for the asset services we provide based upon a specified percentage of the monthly rental income or rental receipts generated from the property under management, or in certain cases, the greater of such percentage fee or a minimum agreed-upon fee.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P28_S1	We are also normally reimbursed for our administrative and payroll costs, as well as certain out-of-pocket expenses, directly attributable to the properties under management.

1138118_12_ITEM1_P43_S1	Development activity in which Trammell Crow Company has an ownership interest is conducted through subsidiaries that are consolidated or unconsolidated for financial reporting purposes, depending primarily on the extent and nature of our ownership interest.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P44_S0	Trammell Crow Company has established several commingled investment funds to facilitate its pursuit of opportunistic and value-added development and investment projects.

1138118_12_ITEM1_P48_S1	Each business discipline is highly competitive on an international, national, regional and local level.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P48_S2	Although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2011 revenue, our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies, property types and services.

1138118_12_ITEM1_P49_S1	Some of these firms may have greater financial resources than we do.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P50_S0	Despite recent consolidation, the commercial real estate services industry remains highly fragmented and competitive.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P50_S1	Although many of our competitors are local or regional firms and are substantially smaller than us, some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P50_S2	We are also subject to competition from other large multi-national firms that have similar service competencies to ours, including Cushman Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle as well as national firms such as Grubb Ellis.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P51_S0	Seasonality A significant portion of our revenue is seasonal, which can affect an investor s ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P51_S1	Historically, this seasonality has caused our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P51_S2	Earnings and cash flow have historically been particularly concentrated in the fourth quarter due to investors and companies focusing on completing transactions prior to calendar year-end.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P51_S3	This has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first quarter, with revenue and profitability improving in each subsequent quarter.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P52_S0	Employees At December 31, 2011, we had approximately 34,000 employees worldwide, excluding affiliate offices, approximately 40% of which are in our outsourcing business and are fully reimbursed by our clients.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P52_S1	At December 31, 2011, 771 of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements, most of whom are on-site employees in our asset services business in New York, New Jersey, Illinois and California.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P53_S0	We believe that relations with our employees are generally good.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P54_S0	We hold various trademarks and trade names worldwide, which include the CBRE name.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P54_S1	Although we believe our intellectual property plays a role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve, we do not believe we would be materially, adversely affected by expiration or termination of our trademarks or trade names or the loss of any of our other intellectual property rights other than the CBRE, CB Richard Ellis and Trammell Crow names.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P54_S2	With respect to the CBRE and CB Richard Ellis names, we have processed and continuously maintain trademark registrations for these service marks in the United States and the CBRE and CB Richard Ellis related marks are in registration or in process in most foreign jurisdictions where we conduct significant business.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P54_S3	We obtained our most recent U.S. trademark registrations for the CBRE and CB Richard Ellis related marks in 2005, and these registrations would expire in 2015 if we failed to renew them.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P54_S4	We hold a license to use the Trammell Crow trade name pursuant to a license agreement with CF98, L.P., an affiliate of Crow Realty Investors, L.P., d/b/a Crow Holdings, which may be revoked if we fail to satisfy usage and quality control covenants under the license agreement.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P55_S0	In addition to trade names, we have developed proprietary technologies for the provision of complex services through our global outsourcing business and for preparing and developing valuation reports for our clients through our valuation business.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P55_S1	We also offer proprietary research to clients through our CBRE-EA research unit and we offer proprietary investment structures through CBRE Global Investors.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P56_S0	While we seek to secure our rights under applicable intellectual property protection laws in these and any other proprietary assets that we use in our business, we do not believe any of these other items of intellectual property are material to our business in the aggregate.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P57_S0	Environmental Matters Federal, state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business impose environmental liabilities, controls, disclosure rules and zoning restrictions that impact the ownership, management, development, use, or sale of commercial real estate.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P57_S1	Certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability on current or previous real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating, cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property, including contamination resulting from above-ground or underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos or lead at a property.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P57_S2	If contamination occurs or is present during our role as a property or facility manager or developer, we could be held liable for such costs as a current operator of a property, regardless of the legality of the acts or omissions that caused the contamination and without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P57_S3	The operator of a site also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from exposure to hazardous substances or environmental contamination at a site, including liabilities arising from exposure to asbestos-containing materials.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P58_S0	Under certain laws and common law principles, any failure by us to disclose environmental contamination at a property could subject us to liability to a buyer or lessee of the property.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P58_S1	Further, federal, state and local governments in the countries in which we do business have begun enacting various laws, regulations, and treaties governing environmental and climate change, particularly for greenhouse gases, which seek to tax, penalize, or limit the release of those greenhouse gases.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P58_S2	Such regulations could lead to increased operational or compliance costs over time.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P59_S0	While we are aware of the presence or the potential presence of regulated substances in the soil or groundwater at or near several properties owned, operated or managed by us, which may have resulted from historical or ongoing activities on those properties, we are not aware of any material noncompliance with the environmental laws or regulations currently applicable to us, and we are not the subject of any material claim for liability with respect to contamination at any location.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P59_S1	However, these laws and regulations may discourage sales and leasing activities and mortgage lending with respect to some properties, which may adversely affect both us and the commercial real estate services industry in general.
1138118_12_ITEM1_P59_S2	Environmental contamination or other environmental liabilities may also negatively affect the value of commercial real estate assets held by entities that are managed by our investment management and development services businesses, which could adversely impact the results of operations of these business lines.

1138118_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report and other public statements we make.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Based on the information currently known to us, we believe that the matters discussed below identify the most significant risk factors affecting our business.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	However, the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and, accordingly, our business could be harmed by an economic slowdown and downturn in commercial real estate asset values, property sales and leasing activities.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Periods of economic weakness or recession, significantly rising interest rates, declining employment levels, declining demand for commercial real estate, falling real estate values, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, may negatively affect the performance of some or all of our business lines.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P2_S2	These economic conditions can result in a general decline in acquisition, disposition and leasing activity, as well as a general decline in the value of commercial real estate and in rents, which in turn reduces revenue from property management fees and commissions derived from property sales, leasing, valuation and financing, as well as revenues associated with development activities.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P2_S3	In addition, we could experience a reduction in the amount of fees we earn in our Global Investment Management business if our assets under management decrease or those assets fail to perform as anticipated.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P2_S4	These conditions can lead to a decline in property sales prices as well as a decline in funds invested in existing commercial real estate assets and properties planned for development.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our development and investment strategy often entails making relatively modest investments alongside our investor clients.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our ability to conduct these activities depends in part on the supply of investment capital for commercial real estate and related assets.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P3_S2	During an economic downturn, investment capital is usually constrained and it may take longer for us to dispose of real estate investments or selling prices may be lower than originally anticipated.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P3_S3	As a result, the value of our commercial real estate investments may be reduced and we could realize losses or diminished profitability.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P3_S4	In addition, economic downturns may reduce the amount of loan originations and related servicing by our commercial mortgage brokerage business.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Performance of our asset services line of business partially depends upon the performance of the properties we manage because our fees are generally based on a percentage of aggregate rent collections from these properties.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The performance of these properties may be impacted by many factors which are partially or completely outside of our control, including (i) real estate and financial market conditions prevailing generally and locally, (ii) our ability to attract and retain creditworthy tenants, particularly during economic downturns; and (iii) the magnitude of defaults by tenants under their respective leases, which may increase during distressed conditions.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	During 2008 and 2009, credit became severely constrained and prohibitively expensive and real estate market activity contracted sharply in most markets around the world as a result of the global financial crisis and the deep economic recession.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	These adverse macro conditions impacted real estate services companies like ours by significantly hampering transaction activity and lowering real estate valuations.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Similar to other commercial real estate services firms, our transaction volumes fell during 2008 and most of 2009, and as a result, our stock price declined significantly.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P5_S3	If the economic and market conditions that prevailed in 2008 and 2009 were to return, our business performance and profitability could again deteriorate.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Adverse developments in the credit markets may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P5_S5	Our Global Investment Management, Development Services and Capital Markets (including investment property sales and debt and equity financing services) businesses are sensitive to credit cost and availability as well as marketplace liquidity.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P5_S6	Additionally, the revenues in all of our businesses are dependent to some extent on the overall volume of activity (and pricing) in the commercial real estate market.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business of providing advisory services to owners, investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with the leasing, disposition and acquisition of property.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	If our clients are unable to procure credit on favorable terms, there may be fewer completed leasing transactions, dispositions and acquisitions of property.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Global Investment Management and Development Services businesses will be unable to generate incentive fees and we may also experience losses of co-invested equity capital if the disruption causes a permanent decline in the value of investments made.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	In 2008 and 2009, the credit markets experienced a disruption of unprecedented magnitude.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	This disruption reduced the availability and significantly increased the cost of most sources of funding.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In some cases, these sources were eliminated.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	While the credit market has shown signs of improving since the second half of 2009, liquidity remains constrained and it is impossible to predict when the market will return to normalcy.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	This uncertainty may lead market participants to continue to act more conservatively, which may amplify decreases in demand and pricing in the markets we serve.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us and, in the event of a default, all of our borrowings would become immediately due and payable.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Our debt instruments, including our credit agreement, impose, and the terms of any future debt may impose, operating and other restrictions on us and many of our subsidiaries.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P10_S2	These restrictions affect, and in many respects limit or prohibit, our ability to:
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	finance ongoing operations, strategic acquisitions, investments or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest, including:
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our credit agreement currently requires us to maintain a minimum coverage ratio of EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) to total interest expense of 2.25x and a maximum leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) of 3.75x.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot give assurance that we will be able to meet those ratios when required.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P12_S2	For example, we experienced a decline in EBITDA during the economic downturn in 2008 to 2009, which negatively impacted our minimum coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P12_S3	However, we significantly reduced our cost structure during 2008 and 2009, and, as a result of these cost reductions as well as renewed growth in our business, we are well within compliance with the minimum coverage ratio and the maximum leverage ratio under our credit agreement.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Our coverage ratio of EBITDA to total interest expense was 15.0x for the year ended December 31, 2011 and our leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to EBITDA was 1.53x as of December 31, 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P12_S5	We continue to monitor our projected compliance with these financial ratios and other terms of our credit agreement.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P12_S6	A breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our debt instruments.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P12_S7	If any such default occurs, the lenders under our credit agreement may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P12_S8	The lenders under our credit agreement also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	borrowings when due, the lenders under our credit agreement will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt, which collateral is described in the immediately following risk factor.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	If the debt under our credit agreement were to be accelerated, we cannot give assurance that this collateral would be sufficient to repay our debt.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	If we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under our credit agreement, the lenders under such credit agreement could foreclose on, and acquire control of, substantially all of our assets.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Our credit agreement is jointly and severally guaranteed by us and substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Borrowings under our credit agreement are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the capital stock of our U.S. subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P13_S5	In addition, in connection with any amendment to our credit agreement, we may need to grant additional collateral to the lenders.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P13_S6	If we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due, the lenders under our credit agreement will have the right to proceed against this pledged capital stock and take control of substantially all of our assets.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P13_S7	Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could harm our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We established new term loans totaling approximately $800.0 million under our credit agreement in 2011 to finance the REIM Acquisitions.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P14_S2	As of December 31, 2011, our total debt, excluding notes payable on real estate and warehouse lines of credit (both of which are generally nonrecourse to us), was approximately $2.5 billion.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P14_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2011, our interest expense was approximately $150.2 million.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P14_S5	In addition, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or for other purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P14_S6	If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our debt, would increase.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P14_S7	If we are required to seek an amendment to our credit agreement, our debt service obligations may be substantially increased.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P14_S8	Our debt could have other important consequences, which include, but are not limited to, the following:
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	our level of debt may restrict us from raising additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and other general corporate requirements.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	From time to time, Moody s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard Poor s Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., rate our significant outstanding debt.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	other terms of any future borrowings, and could also cause a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock in addition to our outstanding debt instruments.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We cannot be certain that our earnings will be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	If we do not have sufficient earnings, we may be required to seek to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or sell more securities, none of which we can guarantee that we will be able to do and which, if accomplished, may adversely impact our stock price.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We have limited restrictions on the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur, which may intensify the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our indebtedness.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Subject to the maximum amounts of indebtedness permitted by our credit agreement covenants, we are not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur in connection with the financing of our development activities, and we may in the future incur such indebtedness in order to decrease the amount of equity we invest in these activities.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Subject to certain covenants in our various bank credit agreements, we are also not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt CBRE Capital Markets may incur in connection with funding loan originations for multi-family properties having prior purchase commitments by a government sponsored entity.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P17_S5	If we experience defaults by multiple clients or counterparties, it could adversely affect our business.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P17_S6	We could be adversely affected by the actions and deteriorating financial condition and results of operations of certain of our clients or counterparties if that led to losses or defaults by one or more of them, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P17_S7	Any of our clients may experience a downturn in their business that may weaken their results of operations and financial condition.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P17_S8	As a result, a client may fail to make payments when due, become insolvent or declare bankruptcy.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P17_S9	Any client bankruptcy or insolvency, or the failure of any client to make payments when due, could result in material losses to our company.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P17_S10	A client bankruptcy would delay or preclude full collection of amounts owed to us.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P17_S11	Additionally, certain corporate services and property management client agreements require that we advance payroll and other vendor costs on behalf of clients.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P17_S12	If such a client were to file bankruptcy or otherwise fail, we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for those costs or for the severance obligations we would incur as a result of the loss of the client.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P17_S13	The bankruptcy or insolvency of a significant counterparty (which may include co-brokers, lenders, insurance companies, hedging counterparties, service providers or other organizations with which we do business), or the failure of any significant counterparty to perform its contractual commitments, may result in disruption to our business or material losses to our company.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P17_S14	Our goodwill and other intangible assets could become further impaired, which may require us to take significant non-cash charges against earnings.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P17_S15	Under current accounting guidelines, we must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P17_S16	Any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of such analysis would result in a non-cash charge against earnings, which charge could materially adversely affect our reported results of operations, stockholders equity and our stock price.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P17_S17	For example, due to the severe market downturn and credit crisis, we determined in December 2008 that the negative impact of the global economic slowdown and resulting decline in our stock price represented an adverse change in our business climate, requiring us to undertake an interim evaluation of our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P17_S18	As a result, we incurred charges of $1.2 billion in connection with the impairment of goodwill and other non-amortizable intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2008.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P17_S19	A significant and sustained decline in our future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the economic environment, slower growth rates or if our stock price falls below our net book value per share for a sustained period, all could result in the need to perform additional impairment analysis in future periods.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P17_S20	If we were to conclude that a future write-down of goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary, then we would record such additional charges, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees (including those acquired through acquisitions).
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees, including Brett White, our Chief Executive Officer.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Mr. White and certain other key employees are not parties to employment agreements with us.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P18_S3	We also are highly dependent upon the retention of our property sales and leasing professionals, who generate a significant amount of our revenues, as well as other revenue producing professionals.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P18_S4	The departure of any of our key employees (including those acquired through acquisitions), or the loss of a significant number of key revenue producers, if we are unable to quickly hire and integrate qualified replacements, could cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to suffer.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P18_S5	In addition, the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified support personnel in all areas of our business, including brokerage and property management personnel.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Competition for these personnel is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit, integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P18_S7	We use equity incentives to help retain and incentivize our key personnel.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P18_S8	Any significant decline in, or failure to grow, our stock price may result in an increased risk of loss of these key personnel.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P18_S9	If we are unable to attract and retain these qualified personnel, our growth may be limited and our business and operating results could suffer.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P18_S10	Our international operations subject us to social, political and economic risks of doing business in foreign countries.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P18_S11	We conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the United States and as a result, we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P18_S12	During 2011, we generated approximately 41% of our revenue from operations outside the United States.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P18_S13	With the REIM Acquisitions, the footprint of our Global Investment Management business has significantly expanded, particularly in Europe and Asia.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P18_S14	Additional circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations include, but are not limited to, the following factors:
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in countries such as China.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	monetary fines, penalties, equitable remedies (including disgorgement), and other costs against us or our employees, and may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We have committed additional resources to expand our worldwide sales and marketing activities, to globalize our service offerings and products in selected markets and to develop local sales and support channels.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P20_S2	If we are unable to successfully implement these plans, maintain adequate long-term strategies that successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Our revenue and earnings may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Our revenue from non-U.S. operations is denominated primarily in the local currency where the associated revenue was earned.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P20_S5	During 2011, approximately 41% of our revenue was transacted in foreign currencies, the majority of which included the Euro, the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar, the Chinese yuan, the Hong Kong dollar, the Japanese yen, the Singapore dollar, the Australian dollar and the Indian rupee.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P20_S6	With the closing of the REIM Acquisitions, our Global Investment Management business now has a significant amount of Euro-denominated assets under management as well as associated revenue and earnings in Europe, which has seen a developing crisis in sovereign debt resulting in a notable drop in the value of the Euro against the U.S. dollar.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may result in corresponding fluctuations in our assets under management, revenue and earnings.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Over time, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and the Euro relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P21_S3	In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the Euro may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P21_S4	From time to time, our management uses currency hedging instruments, including foreign currency forward and option contracts and borrows in foreign currencies.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P21_S5	There can be no assurance that these hedging instruments will be available when needed.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P21_S6	Additionally, economic risks associated with these hedging instruments include unexpected fluctuations in inflation rates, which impact cash flow, and unexpected changes in the underlying net asset position.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our growth has benefited significantly from acquisitions, which may not be available in the future or perform as expected.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	A significant component of our growth has occurred through acquisitions, including our acquisition of the Trammell Crow Company in December 2006 and the REIM Acquisitions that we completed in the second half of 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions, which may not be available to us, as well as sufficient liquidity and credit to fund these acquisitions.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P22_S3	We may incur significant additional debt from time to time to finance any such acquisitions, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our then-existing indebtedness.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P22_S4	If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our then-existing debt, would increase.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P22_S5	In addition, acquisitions involve risks that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P22_S6	Future acquisitions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transaction-related expenses, which include severance, lease termination, transaction and deferred financing costs, among others.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We have had, and may continue to experience, difficulties in integrating operations and accounting systems acquired from other companies.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	business concerns and the potential loss of our key employees or those of the acquired operations.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The integration process itself may be disruptive to our business as it requires coordination of geographically diverse organizations and implementation of new accounting and information technology systems.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We believe that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on operating and net income.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Acquisitions also frequently involve significant costs related to integrating information technology, accounting and management services and rationalizing personnel levels.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P25_S2	As with prior material transactions, we expect to incur significant integration expenses associated with the REIM Acquisitions in 2012 and beyond.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P25_S3	The anticipated benefits of the REIM Acquisitions may not be realized as we contemplated.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P25_S4	We completed the REIM Acquisitions with the expectation that such acquisitions would result in various benefits, including, among others, enhanced revenues and margins, a strengthened market position, cross-selling opportunities and operating efficiencies.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Achieving the anticipated benefits of the REIM Acquisitions will be subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether we successfully integrate the business being acquired, achieve expected synergies, and realize accretive benefits in the timeframe anticipated.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P25_S6	Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management s time and energy, which could materially impact our financial condition and operating results.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our revenue, net income and cash flow generated by our Global Investment Management business can vary significantly as a result of market developments.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P26_S1	With the completion of the REIM Acquisitions, our Global Investment Management business has significantly increased and become more globally diverse.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P26_S2	With the addition of the REIM funds, a substantial part of our fees are more recurring in nature.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P26_S3	However, the revenue, net income and cash flow generated by our Global Investment Management business are all somewhat variable, primarily due to the fact that management, transaction and incentive fees can vary as a result of market movements from one period to another.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P26_S4	The pace at which the real estate markets worldwide turned from positive to negative starting in 2007 and continuing into 2009 is an example of the market volatility to which we are subject and over which we have no control.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The underlying market conditions, decisions regarding the acquisition and disposition of fund and separate account assets, and the specifics of client mandates will cause the amount of asset management, transaction and incentive fees to vary from one product to another.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	A substantial part of our fees are based upon the value of the assets we manage and if asset values deteriorate our asset management fees will decline as a result.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Our acquisition and disposition fees can decline as a result of delay in the deployment of capital or limited market liquidity.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P27_S3	We also earn incentive fees tied to portfolio performance, which fees may decline if there is a downturn in real estate markets and we fail to meet benchmarks or absolute return hurdles.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P27_S4	Finally, during periods of economic weakness or recession, existing and prospective clients in our Global Investment Management business may be less able or willing to commit new funds to real estate investments, which are inherently less liquid than many competing investment classes, thereby inhibiting the ability of our Global Investment Management business to raise new funds.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P27_S5	Additionally, investors with open commitments to provide additional investment could become less able or willing to honor their financial commitments and seek to renegotiate the terms of their commitments or the fees that they are obligated to pay.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P27_S6	To the extent that clients in our Global Investment Management business seek to avoid paying fees they are obligated to pay, or seek to avoid deploying capital that has been committed, we could experience a rapid decrease in collection of fees and interruptions to our client relationships and business.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P27_S7	Our real estate investment and co-investment activities subject us to real estate investment risks which could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flow.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P27_S8	An important part of the strategy for our Global Investment Management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	As of December 31, 2011, we had committed $59.4 million to fund future co-investments, all of which is expected to be funded during 2012.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	In addition to required future capital contributions, some of the co-investment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P28_S2	The failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments, including damage to our reputation with our co-investment partners and clients, as well as the necessity of obtaining alternative funding from other sources that may be on disadvantageous terms for us and the other co-investors.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Participating as a co-investor is a very important part of our Global Investment Management business, which would suffer if we were unable to make these investments.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Although our debt instruments contain restrictions that limit our ability to provide capital to the entities holding direct or indirect interests in co-investments, we may provide this capital in many instances.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Selective investment in real estate projects is an important part of our Development Services business strategy and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investment.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P29_S2	As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately 45 consolidated real estate projects with invested equity of $26.9 million and $13.6 million of notes payable on real estate that are recourse to us (in addition to being recourse to the single-purpose entity that holds the real estate asset and is the primary obligor on the note payable).
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P29_S3	In addition, at December 31, 2011, we were involved as a principal (in most cases, co-investing with our clients) in approximately 45 unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries with invested equity of $52.3 million and had committed additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries of $14.4 million.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P29_S4	We also guaranteed notes payable of these unconsolidated subsidiaries of $1.4 million, excluding guarantees for which we have outstanding liabilities accrued on our consolidated balance sheet.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	During the ordinary course of our Development Services business, we provide numerous completion and budget guarantees requiring us to complete the relevant project within a specified timeframe and/or within a specified budget, with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P30_S1	While we generally have guaranteed maximum price contracts with reputable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees (which are intended to pass most of the risk to such contractors), there can be no assurance that we will not have to perform under any such guarantees.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P30_S2	If we are required to perform under a significant number of such guarantees, it could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Because the disposition of a single significant investment can impact our financial performance in any period, our real estate investment activities could increase fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flow.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P30_S4	In many cases, we have limited control over the timing of the disposition of these investments and the recognition of any related gain or loss, or incentive participation fee.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P30_S5	Poor performance of the investment programs that our Global Investment Management business manages would cause a decline in our revenue, net income and cash flow and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future programs.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P30_S6	In the event that any of the investment programs that our Global Investment Management business manages were to perform poorly, our revenue, net income and cash flow could decline because the value of the assets we manage would decrease, which would result in a reduction in some of our management fees, and our investment returns would decrease, resulting in a reduction in the incentive compensation we earn.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P30_S7	Moreover, we could experience losses on co-investments of our own capital in such programs as a result of poor performance.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P30_S8	Investors and potential investors in our programs continually assess our performance, and our ability to raise capital for existing and future programs and maintain our current fee structure will depend on our continued satisfactory performance.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We are subject to substantial litigation risks and may face significant liabilities and damage to our professional reputation as a result of litigation allegations and negative publicity.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P31_S1	As a licensed real estate broker, we and our licensed employees are subject to regulatory due diligence, disclosure and standard-of-care obligations.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Failure to fulfill these obligations could subject us or our employees to litigation from parties who purchased, sold or leased properties that we or they brokered or managed.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P31_S3	We could become subject to claims by participants in real estate sales, as well as building owners and companies for whom we provide management services, alleging that we did not fulfill our regulatory and fiduciary obligations.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	In addition, in our property management business, we hire and supervise third-party contractors to provide construction services for our managed properties.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P32_S1	While our role is limited to that of an agent for the owner, we may be subject to claims for construction defects or other similar actions.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P32_S2	The advice we render in our financial advisory business and the investment decisions we make in our Global Investment Management business and the activities of our investment banking and investment management professionals for or on behalf of our clients may subject them and us to the risk of third-party litigation.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Such litigation may arise from client or investor dissatisfaction with the performance of our programs and a variety of other litigation claims, including allegations that we improperly exercised judgment, discretion, control or influence over client investments or that we breached fiduciary duties to clients.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P32_S4	To the extent investors in our programs suffer losses resulting from fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or other similar misconduct, investors may have remedies against us, our investment programs or funds or our employees under the federal securities law and state law.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P32_S5	Moreover, we are exposed to risks of litigation or investigation by investors and regulators relating to allegations of our having engaged in transactions involving conflicts of interest that were not properly addressed.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P32_S6	Some of these litigation risks may be mitigated by our self-insurance programs or by the commercial insurance we maintain in amounts we believe are appropriate.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P32_S7	However, in the event of a substantial loss, our insurance coverage and/or self-insurance reserve levels might not be sufficient to pay the full damages.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P32_S8	Further, the value of otherwise valid claims we hold under insurance policies could become uncollectible in the event of the covering insurance company s insolvency, although we seek to limit this risk by placing our commercial insurance only with highly-rated companies.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P32_S9	Any of these events could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P32_S10	We depend on our business relationships and our reputation for integrity and high-caliber professional services to attract and retain clients across our overall business, as well as investors for our Global Investment Management business.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P32_S11	As a result, allegations by private litigants or regulators of conflicts of interest or improper conduct by us, whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us, as well as negative publicity and press speculation about us or our investment activities, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and damage our business prospects both in our Global Investment Management business and our other global businesses.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P32_S12	In addition, if any lawsuits were brought against us and resulted in a finding of substantial legal liability, it could materially, adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us, which could materially impact our business.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P32_S13	Our joint venture activities involve unique risks that are often outside of our control which, if realized, could harm our business.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P32_S14	We have utilized joint ventures for commercial investments and local brokerage and other affiliations both in the United States and internationally, and we may acquire minority interests in other joint ventures in the future.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P32_S15	In many of these joint ventures, we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures and other participants may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P32_S16	In addition, the other participants may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P32_S17	If a joint venture participant acts contrary to our interest, it could harm our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We have numerous significant competitors and potential future competitors, some of which may have greater financial and operational resources than we do.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate services industry, including commercial property and corporate facilities management, occupier and property/agency leasing, property sales, valuation, real estate investment management, commercial mortgage origination and servicing, capital markets (equity and debt) solutions, development services and proprietary research.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2011 revenue, our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies, property types and services.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Depending on the geography, property type or service, we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers, including outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have recently expanded their offerings, in-house corporate real estate departments, developers, institutional lenders, insurance companies, investment banking firms, investment managers, and accounting and consulting firms.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Some of these firms may have greater financial resources than we do.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P33_S5	In addition, future changes in laws could lead to the entry of other competitors, such as financial institutions.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P33_S6	Although many of our competitors are local or regional firms and are substantially smaller than us, some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P33_S7	We are also subject to competition from other large national and multi-national firms that have similar service competencies to ours.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P33_S8	In general, there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively, to maintain current fee levels or margins, or maintain or increase our market share.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P33_S9	A significant portion of our operations are concentrated in California and our business could be harmed due to the ongoing economic downturn in the California real estate markets.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P33_S10	During 2011, approximately 10% of our revenue was generated from transactions originating in California.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P33_S11	As a result of the geographic concentration in California, the economic downturns in the California commercial real estate market and particularly in the local economies in San Diego, Los Angeles and Orange County could harm our results of operations and disproportionately affect our business as compared to competitors who have less or different geographic concentrations.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We operate in many jurisdictions with complex and varied tax regimes.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Changes in tax rules or the outcome of tax assessments and audits could cause an adverse effect on our results.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We operate in many jurisdictions with complex and varied tax regimes, and are subject to different forms of taxation resulting in a variable effective tax rate.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P35_S1	In addition, from time to time we engage in transactions that involve different tax jurisdictions.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Due to the different tax laws in the many jurisdictions where we operate, we are often required to make subjective determinations.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P36_S1	The tax authorities in the various jurisdictions where we carry on business may not agree with the determinations that are made by us with respect to the application of tax law.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Such disagreements could result in disputes and, ultimately, in the payment of additional funds to the government authorities of foreign and local jurisdictions where we carry on business, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P36_S3	In addition, changes in tax rules or the outcome of tax assessments and audits could have an adverse effect on our results in any particular quarter.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Our estimate of tax related assets, liabilities, recoveries and expenses incorporates assumptions.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P37_S1	These assumptions include, but are not limited to, the tax laws in various jurisdictions, the effect of tax treaties between jurisdictions, taxable income projections, and the benefits of various restructuring plans.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P37_S2	To the extent that such assumptions differ from actual results, we may have to record additional income tax expenses and liabilities.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P37_S3	We are subject to the possibility of loss contingencies arising out of tax claims, assessments related to uncertain tax positions and provisions for specifically identified income tax exposures.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P37_S4	There are currently tax audits ongoing in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P37_S5	There can be no assurance that we will be successful in resolving potential tax claims that arise from these audits.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	for amounts that cannot be assessed at this stage.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Our failure to do so and/or the need to increase our provisions for such claims could have an adverse effect on our financial position.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P38_S2	If the assets in our defined benefit pension plans are not sufficient to meet the plans obligations, we may be required to make cash contributions to it and our liquidity may be adversely affected.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our subsidiaries based in the United Kingdom maintain two contributory defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in the plans.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P39_S1	With respect to these plans, our historical policy has been to contribute annually, an amount to fund pension cost as actuarially determined and as required by applicable laws and regulations.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Our contributions to these plans are invested and, if these investments do not perform in the future as well as we expect, we will be required to provide additional funding to cover any shortfall.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P39_S3	The underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans included in pension liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, which are incorporated herein by reference, was $60.9 million and $40.0 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P39_S4	If the assets in our defined benefit pension plans continue to be insufficient to meet the plans obligations, we may be required to make substantial cash contributions preventing the use of such cash for other purposes and adversely affecting our liquidity.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P39_S5	If we fail to maintain and protect our intellectual property, or infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, our business could be harmed and we could incur financial penalties.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P39_S6	Our business depends, in part, on our ability to identify and protect proprietary information and other intellectual property (such as our service marks, client lists and information, business methods and research).
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P39_S7	Existing laws, or the application of those laws, of some countries in which we operate may offer only limited protections for our intellectual property rights.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P39_S8	We rely on a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality policies, non-disclosure and other contractual arrangements, and on patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P39_S9	Our inability to detect unauthorized use or take appropriate or timely steps to enforce our rights may have an adverse effect on our business.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P39_S10	We cannot be sure that the intellectual property that we may use in the course of operating our business or the services we offer to clients do not infringe on the rights of third parties, and we may have infringement claims asserted against us or against our clients.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P39_S11	These claims may harm our reputation, cost us money and prevent us from offering some services.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Confidential intellectual property is increasingly stored or carried on mobile devices, such as laptop computers, which makes inadvertent disclosure more of a risk in the event the mobile devices are lost or stolen and the information has not been adequately safeguarded or encrypted.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	If we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us in our role as a real estate broker, mortgage broker, property/facility manager or developer, we may incur significant financial penalties.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P41_S1	We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations specific to the services we perform in our business, as well as laws of broader applicability, such as tax, securities, environmental and employment laws.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions and the provision of property management and valuation services require us to maintain applicable licenses in each U.S. state and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we perform these services.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P41_S3	If we fail to maintain our licenses or conduct these activities without a license, or violate any of the regulations covering our licenses, we may be required to pay fines (including treble damages in certain states) or return commissions received or have our licenses suspended or revoked.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P41_S4	In addition, our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, CBRE Global Investors, is subject to laws and regulations as a registered investment advisor and compliance failures or regulatory action could adversely affect our business.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P42_S0	As the size and scope of commercial real estate transactions have increased significantly during the past several years, both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with numerous licensing regimes and the possible loss resulting from non-compliance have increased.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P43_S0	business, both within and outside of the United States, also may change in ways that increase the costs of compliance or prevent us from providing certain types of services in connection with certain transactions or clients.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We may be subject to environmental liability as a result of our role as a property or facility manager or developer of real estate.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Various laws and regulations impose liability on real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating, cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P45_S1	In our role as a property or facility manager or developer, we could be held liable as an operator for such costs.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P45_S2	This liability may be imposed without regard to the legality of the original actions and without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P45_S3	If we fail to disclose environmental issues, we could also be liable to a buyer or lessee of a property.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P45_S4	If we incur any such liability, our business could suffer significantly as it could be difficult for us to develop or sell such properties, or borrow funds using such properties as collateral.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P45_S5	Additionally, liabilities incurred to comply with more stringent future environmental requirements could adversely affect any or all of our lines of business.

1138118_12_ITEM1A_P47_S1	These statements also relate to our future prospects, developments and business strategies.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P47_S2	These forward-looking statements are made based on our management s expectations and beliefs concerning future events affecting us and are subject to uncertainties and factors relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control.
1138118_12_ITEM1A_P47_S3	These uncertainties and factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those matters expressed in or implied by these forward-looking statements.

1138118_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	of December 31, 2011: Some of our offices that contain employees of our Global Investment Management or our Development Services segments also contain employees of our other business segments.
1138118_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	Often, the employees of these segments occupy separate suites in the same building in order to operate the businesses independently with standalone offices.
1138118_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	We have provided above office totals by geographic region and not listed all of our Global Investment Management and Development Services offices to avoid double counting.
1138118_12_ITEM2_P1_S1	In general, these leased offices are fully utilized.
1138118_12_ITEM2_P2_S0	The most significant terms of the leasing arrangements for our offices are the length of the lease and the rent.
1138118_12_ITEM2_P2_S1	Our leases have terms varying in duration.
1138118_12_ITEM2_P2_S2	The rent payable under our office leases varies significantly from location to location as a result of differences in prevailing commercial real estate rates in different geographic locations.
1138118_12_ITEM2_P3_S0	Our management believes that no single office lease is material to our business, results of operations or financial condition.
1138118_12_ITEM2_P3_S1	In addition, we believe there is adequate alternative office space available at acceptable rental rates to meet our needs, although adverse movements in rental rates in some markets may negatively affect our profits in those markets when we enter into new leases.
1138118_12_ITEM2_P3_S2	We do not own any offices, which is consistent with our strategy to lease instead of own.
1138118_12_ITEM2_P3_S3	Legal Proceedings We are a party to a number of pending or threatened lawsuits arising out of, or incident to, our ordinary course of business.
1138118_12_ITEM2_P3_S4	Our management believes that any losses in excess of the amounts accrued arising from such lawsuits are remote, but that litigation is inherently uncertain and there is the potential for a material adverse effect on our financial statements if one or more matters are resolved in a particular period in an amount in excess of that anticipated by management.
1138118_12_ITEM5_P0_S0	the last two fiscal years, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange, are set forth below for the periods indicated.
1138118_12_ITEM5_P1_S0	The closing share price for our Class A common stock on December 30, 2011, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange, was $15.22.
1138118_12_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of February 13, 2012, there were 356 stockholders of record of our Class A common stock.
1138118_12_ITEM5_P2_S1	We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on any class of our common stock since our inception on February 20, 2001, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.
1138118_12_ITEM5_P2_S2	We currently intend to retain any future earnings to reduce debt and finance future growth.
1138118_12_ITEM5_P2_S3	Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors that the board of directors deems relevant.
1138118_12_ITEM5_P2_S4	In addition, our ability to declare and pay cash dividends is restricted by the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility and senior secured term loan facilities.
1138118_12_ITEM5_P3_S0	Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities None.
1138118_12_ITEM5_P3_S1	Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities None.

1138118_12_ITEM6_P0_S1	The statement of operations data, the statement of cash flows data and the other data for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 and the balance sheet data as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 were derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

1138118_12_ITEM6_P1_S0	Note: We have not declared any cash dividends on common stock for the periods shown.
1138118_12_ITEM6_P2_S0	(1) In 2011, we completed a series of strategic transactions with Netherlands-based ING Group N.V. and its affiliates (ING).
1138118_12_ITEM6_P2_S1	We acquired substantially all of ING s Real Estate Investment Management (REIM) operations in Europe and Asia, and its U.S.-based global real estate listed securities business, Clarion Real Estate Securities (CRES), for over $810 million in cash (which we refer to as the REIM Acquisitions).
1138118_12_ITEM6_P2_S2	In addition, we acquired co-investment interests totaling approximately $80 million.
1138118_12_ITEM6_P2_S3	The results for the year ended December 31, 2011 include the operations of CRES, ING REIM Asia and ING REIM Europe from July 1, 2011, October 3, 2011 and October 31, 2011, respectively, the dates each respective business was acquired.
1138118_12_ITEM6_P3_S0	(2) EPS represents earnings per share.
1138118_12_ITEM6_P3_S1	See Earnings Per Share information in Note 18 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_12_ITEM6_P4_S0	EBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.
1138118_12_ITEM6_P4_S1	Our management believes EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions.
1138118_12_ITEM6_P4_S2	Such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.
1138118_12_ITEM6_P4_S3	As a result, our management uses EBITDA as a measure to evaluate the operating performance of our various business segments and for other discretionary purposes, including as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive programs.
1138118_12_ITEM6_P4_S4	Additionally, we believe EBITDA is useful to investors to assist them in getting a more complete picture of our results from operations.
1138118_12_ITEM6_P4_S5	However, EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and when analyzing our operating performance, readers should use EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP.
1138118_12_ITEM6_P4_S6	Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
1138118_12_ITEM6_P4_S7	Furthermore, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management s discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.
1138118_12_ITEM6_P4_S8	The amounts shown for EBITDA also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
1138118_12_ITEM6_P5_S0	EBITDA is calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_12_ITEM6_P6_S0	(4) Notes payable on real estate disclosed here includes the current and long-term portions of notes payable on real estate as well as notes payable included in liabilities related to real estate and other assets held for sale.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	We are the world s largest commercial real estate services firm, based on 2011 revenue, with leading full-service operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P0_S1	We offer a full range of services to occupiers, owners, lenders and investors in office, retail, industrial, multi-family and other types of commercial real estate.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P0_S2	As of December 31, 2011, we operated more than 300 offices worldwide, excluding affiliate offices, with approximately 34,000 employees providing commercial real estate services under the CBRE brand name, investment management services under the CBRE Global Investors brand name and development services under the Trammell Crow brand name.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P0_S3	Our business is focused on several competencies, including commercial property and corporate facilities management, occupier and property/agency leasing, property sales, valuation, real estate investment management, commercial mortgage origination and servicing, capital markets (equity and debt) solutions, development services and proprietary research.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P0_S4	We generate revenues from contractual management fees and on a per-project or transactional basis.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P0_S5	Since 2006, we have been the only commercial real estate services company included in the S P 500.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P0_S6	In every year since 2008, we have been the only commercial real estate services firm to be included in the Fortune 500 .
1138118_12_ITEM7_P0_S7	Additionally, the International Association of Outsourcing Professionals has included us among the top 100 global outsourcing companies across all industries for five consecutive years, including in 2011 when we ranked 6th overall and were the highest ranked commercial real estate services company.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P0_S8	In 2011, we were the highest ranked commercial real estate services company among the Fortune Most Admired Companies, and achieved the highest brand reputation ranking among all commercial real estate companies in a survey of Wall Street Journal subscribers.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	When you read our financial statements and the information included in this section, you should consider that we have experienced, and continue to experience, several material trends and uncertainties that have affected our financial condition and results of operations that make it challenging to predict our future performance based on our historical results.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	We believe that the following material trends and uncertainties are crucial to an understanding of the variability in our historical earnings and cash flows and the potential for continued variability in the future: Macroeconomic Conditions Economic trends and government policies affect global and regional commercial real estate markets as well as our operations directly.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P1_S2	These include: overall economic activity and employment growth, interest rate levels, the cost and availability of credit and the impact of tax and regulatory policies.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P1_S3	Periods of economic weakness or recession, significantly rising interest rates, declining employment levels, decreasing demand for real estate, falling real estate values, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, will negatively affect the performance of some or all of our business lines.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P1_S4	From late 2007 through 2009, the severe global economic downturn and credit market crisis had significant adverse effects on our operations by depressing transaction activity, decreasing occupancy and rental rates, sharply lowering property values and restraining corporate spending.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P1_S5	These trends, in turn, adversely affected our revenue from property management fees and commissions derived from property sales, leasing, valuation and financing, and funds available to invest in commercial real estate and related assets.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P1_S6	These negative trends began to reverse in 2010 and 2011 as commercial real estate markets improved in step with the stabilization and recovery of global economic activity.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P1_S7	Weak economic conditions from late 2007 through 2009 also affected our compensation expense, which is structured to generally decrease in line with a fall in revenue.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P1_S8	Compensation is our largest expense and the sales and leasing professionals in our largest line of business, advisory services, generally are paid on a commission and bonus basis that correlates with our revenue performance.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P1_S9	As a result, the negative effect of difficult market conditions on our operating margins was partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P1_S10	In addition, at times when negative economic conditions are particularly severe, as they were in 2008 and 2009, our management has moved decisively to improve operational performance by lowering operating expenses through such actions as reducing discretionary bonuses, curtailing capital expenditures and adjusting overall staffing levels, among others.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	to restore certain of these expenses in 2010 and 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	Notwithstanding the ongoing market recovery, a return of adverse global and regional economic trends remains one of the most significant risks to the performance of our operations and our financial condition.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	Economic conditions first began to negatively affect our performance in the Americas, our largest segment in terms of revenue, beginning in the third quarter of 2007.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	The effects became more severe as the decline in economic activity (particularly in the United States) accelerated throughout 2008 and most of 2009.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	The global capital markets disruption in late 2008, in particular, caused a significant and prolonged decline in property sales, leasing, financing and investment activity that adversely affected all our business lines.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	Commercial real estate fundamentals began to stabilize in early 2010 and to improve later that year following a return to positive economic growth in the United States.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	The recovery continued at a slow pace in 2011, as vacancy rates dipped moderately, rental rates stabilized or edged up slightly, credit became more readily available and property sales and leasing activity increased.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P5_S2	However, market activity has remained well below levels experienced in 2006 and 2007.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	In Europe, weakening market conditions first began to manifest in the United Kingdom in late 2007 and in countries on the continent in early 2008.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	The major European economies also fell into recession in 2008, which deepened and persisted through 2009.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P6_S2	Economic activity improved in 2010, but began to wane again in the second half of 2011, due to the effects of the European sovereign debt crisis.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P6_S3	As a result, economic growth in Europe lagged behind other parts of the world in 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P6_S4	While rents essentially remained flat in 2011, leasing velocity slowed in many major markets in Europe.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	Investment sales in Europe were adversely affected by the financial crisis in late 2008 and most of 2009.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	Larger markets like London and Paris showed strong increases in investment sales starting in late 2009, but activity reached a plateau across most of Europe in 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P7_S2	Real estate markets in Asia Pacific were also affected, though generally to a lesser degree than in the United States and Europe, by the global credit market dislocation and economic downturn.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P7_S3	This resulted in lower investment sales and leasing activity in the region in 2008 and most of 2009.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P7_S4	Transaction activity revived significantly in late 2009, reflecting strong economic growth, and improved through 2010 and most of 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P7_S5	However, the improvement began to slow in the later stages of 2011, due to heightened concerns about how the European sovereign debt crisis and tepid U.S. economic growth would affect the region s economies.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P7_S6	Beginning in late 2007, deteriorating conditions also adversely affected real estate investment management and property development activity, as property values declined sharply, and both financing and disposal options became more limited.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P7_S7	However, market conditions for these businesses improved as financing and investment sales markets recovered in late 2010 and 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P7_S8	The further recovery of our global sales, leasing, investment management and development services operations depends on continued improvement in market fundamentals, including solid economic growth and sustained, strong job growth; stable and healthy global credit markets; and increased business and investor confidence.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P7_S9	Effects of Acquisitions Our management historically has made significant use of strategic acquisitions to add new service competencies, to increase our scale within existing competencies and to expand our presence in various geographic regions around the world.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P7_S10	In December 2006, we acquired the Trammell Crow Company (the Trammell Crow Company Acquisition), our largest acquisition to date, which deepened our outsourcing services offerings for corporate and institutional clients, especially project and facilities management, strengthened our ability to provide integrated management solutions across geographies, and established resources and expertise to offer real estate development services throughout the United States.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	On February 15, 2011, we announced that we had entered into definitive agreements to acquire the majority of the real estate investment management business of Netherlands-based ING Group N.V. (ING) for approximately $940 million in cash.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	The acquisitions included substantially all of ING s Real Estate Investment Management (REIM) operations in Europe and Asia, as well as substantially all of Clarion Real Estate Securities (CRES), its U.S.-based global real estate listed securities business (collectively referred to as ING REIM).
1138118_12_ITEM7_P8_S2	On February 15, 2011, we also announced that we expected to acquire approximately $55 million of CRES co-investments from ING and potentially additional interests in other funds managed by ING REIM Europe and ING REIM Asia.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P8_S3	Upon completion of the acquisitions, which we refer to as the REIM Acquisitions, ING REIM became part of our Global Investment Management segment (which conducts business through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, CBRE Global Investors, an independently operated business segment).
1138118_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	The ING transaction is highly complementary, with little overlap in client base and different investment strategies.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	CBRE Global Investors has traditionally focused on value-add funds and separate accounts.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	ING REIM has primarily focused on core funds and global listed real estate securities funds, except in Asia, where ING REIM manages value-add and opportunistic funds.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P10_S2	The combined entity provides us with a significantly enhanced ability to meet the needs of institutional investors across global markets with a full spectrum of investment programs and strategies.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P10_S3	On July 1, 2011, we completed the acquisition of CRES for $323.9 million and CRES co-investments from ING for an aggregate amount of $58.6 million.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P10_S4	On October 3, 2011, we completed the acquisition of ING REIM Asia for $45.6 million and three ING REIM Asia co-investments from ING for an aggregate amount of $13.9 million.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P10_S5	On October 31, 2011, we completed the acquisition of ING REIM Europe for $442.5 million and one co-investment from ING for $7.4 million.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P10_S6	Our initial estimate of $940 million in total purchase price for the REIM Acquisitions has been reduced by approximately $47 million for certain fund and separate account management contracts that were not acquired and for certain balance sheet adjustments.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P10_S7	There is a possibility of an additional closing of approximately $80 million and co-investments of up to $68 million in the future related to our acquisition of ING REIM Europe.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	As of December 31, 2011, CBRE Global Investors assets under management, or AUM, totaled $94.1 billion, which includes AUM acquired in the REIM Acquisitions.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	AUM generally refers to the properties and other assets with respect to which we provide (or participate in) oversight, investment management services and other advice, and which generally consist of real estate properties or loans, securities portfolios and investments in operating companies and joint ventures.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P11_S2	Our AUM is intended principally to reflect the extent of our presence in the real estate market, not the basis for determining our management fees.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P11_S3	Our material assets under management consist of:
1138118_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	a) the total fair market value of the real estate properties and other assets either wholly-owned or held by joint ventures and other entities in which our sponsored funds or investment vehicles and client accounts have invested or to which they have provided financing.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	Committed (but unfunded) capital from investors in our sponsored funds is not included in this component of our AUM.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P12_S2	The value of development properties is included at estimated completion cost.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	b) the net asset value of our managed securities portfolios, including investments (which may be comprised of committed but uncalled capital) in private real estate funds under our fund of funds program.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	Our calculation of AUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	Strategic in-fill acquisitions have also played a key role in expanding our geographic coverage and broadening and strengthening our service offerings.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	From 2005 to 2008, we completed 58 in-fill acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $592 million.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	were completed in 2009 and 2010, except for a small niche industrial practice in the United Kingdom acquired in the second quarter of 2010 and a small commercial property asset management and consultancy services firm in Hong Kong acquired in the fourth quarter of 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2011, we completed five in-fill acquisitions, including a valuation business in Australia, a retail property management business in central and eastern Europe, our former affiliate company in Switzerland, a retail services business in the United Kingdom and a shopping center management business in the Netherlands.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P15_S2	The companies we acquired have generally been quality regional firms or niche specialty firms that complement our existing platform within a region, or affiliates in which, in some cases, we held an equity interest.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P15_S3	As market conditions continue to improve, we believe acquisitions may once again serve as a growth engine, supplementing our organic growth.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	Although our management believes that strategic acquisitions can significantly decrease the cost, time and commitment of management resources necessary to attain a meaningful competitive position within targeted markets or to expand our presence within our current markets, our management also believes that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating and net income, both as a result of transaction-related expenditures, which include severance, lease termination, transaction and deferred financing costs, among others, and the charges and costs of integrating the acquired business and its financial and accounting systems into our own.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	For example, through December 31, 2011, we incurred $258.9 million of transaction-related expenditures and integration costs in connection with our acquisition of Trammell Crow Company in 2006.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P16_S2	In addition, through December 31, 2011, we incurred $70.2 million of transaction-related expenditures and integration costs in connection with the REIM Acquisitions.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P16_S3	As with prior material acquisitions, we anticipate incurring significant integration expenses associated with the REIM Acquisitions in 2012 and beyond.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P16_S4	We expect the total (pre-tax) transaction costs relating to the REIM Acquisitions, including retention and integration costs, to be approximately $150 million.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	International Operations As we increase our international operations through either acquisitions or organic growth, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	Our management team generally seeks to mitigate our exposure by balancing assets and liabilities that are denominated in the same currency and by maintaining cash positions outside the United States only at levels necessary for operating purposes.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P17_S2	In addition, from time to time we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate changes related to particular transactions and to hedge risks associated with the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	With the closing of the REIM Acquisitions, our Global Investment Management business now has a significant amount of Euro-denominated assets under management as well as associated revenue and earnings in Europe, which has seen a developing crisis in sovereign debt resulting in a significant drop in the value of the Euro against the U.S. dollar.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may result in corresponding fluctuations in our AUM, revenue and earnings.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	Due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P19_S2	In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and Euro may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P19_S3	Our international operations also are subject to, among other things, political instability and changing regulatory environments, which may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P19_S4	Our management routinely monitors these risks and related costs and evaluates the appropriate amount of resources to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	Leverage We are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	As of December 31, 2011, our total debt, excluding our notes payable on real estate and warehouse lines of credit (both of which are generally nonrecourse to us), was approximately $2.5 billion.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P20_S2	Our level of indebtedness and the operating and financial restrictions in our debt agreements place constraints on the operation of our business.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P20_S3	Although our management believes that long-term indebtedness has been an important lever in the development of our business, including facilitating our acquisition of Trammell Crow Company and the REIM Acquisitions, the cash flow necessary to service this debt is not available for other general corporate purposes, which may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in the commercial real estate services industry.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P20_S4	Our management seeks to mitigate this exposure both through the refinancing of debt when available on attractive terms and through selective repayment and retirement of indebtedness.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that management believes to be reasonable.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P21_S2	Actual results may differ from those estimates.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P21_S3	We believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
1138118_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	Revenue Recognition In order for us to recognize revenue, there are four basic criteria that must be met:
1138118_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	Our revenue recognition policies are consistent with these criteria.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	The judgments involved in revenue recognition include understanding the complex terms of agreements and determining the appropriate time to recognize revenue for each transaction based on such terms.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P24_S1	Each transaction is evaluated to determine: (i) at what point in time revenue is earned, (ii) whether contingencies exist that impact the timing of recognition of revenue and (iii) how and when such contingencies will be resolved.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P24_S2	The timing of revenue recognition could vary if different judgments were made.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P24_S3	Our revenues subject to the most judgment are brokerage commission revenue and incentive-based management and development fees.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P24_S4	We record commission revenue on real estate sales generally upon close of escrow or transfer of title, except when future contingencies exist.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P24_S5	Real estate commissions on leases are generally recorded in revenue when all obligations under the commission agreement are satisfied.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	Terms and conditions of a commission agreement may include, but are not limited to, execution of a signed lease agreement and future contingencies including tenant occupancy, payment of a deposit or payment of a first month s rent (or a combination thereof).
1138118_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	As some of these conditions are outside of our control and are often not clearly defined, judgment must be exercised in determining when such required events have occurred in order to recognize revenue.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	A typical commission agreement provides that we earn a portion of a lease commission upon the execution of the lease agreement by the tenant and landlord, with the remaining portion(s) of the lease commission earned at a later date, usually upon tenant occupancy or payment of rent.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	contingencies results in the delay of recognition of corresponding revenue until such contingencies are satisfied.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	For example, if we do not earn all or a portion of the lease commission until the tenant pays its first month s rent, and the lease agreement provides the tenant with a free rent period, we delay revenue recognition until rent is paid by the tenant.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	Property management revenues are generally based upon percentages of the revenue or base rent generated by the entities managed or the square footage managed.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	These fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related management agreements.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	Investment management fees are based predominantly upon a percentage of the equity deployed on behalf of our limited partners.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	Fees related to our indirect investment management programs are based upon a percentage of the fair value of those investments.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P29_S2	These fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related investment management agreements.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P29_S3	Our Global Investment Management segment also earns performance-based incentive fees with regard to many of its investments.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P29_S4	Such revenue is recognized at the end of the measurement periods when the conditions of the applicable incentive fee arrangements have been satisfied and following the expiration of any potential claw back provision.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P29_S5	With many of these investments, our Global Investment Management team has participation interests in such incentive fees, which are commonly referred to as carried interest.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P29_S6	This carried interest expense is generally accrued for based upon the probability of such performance-based incentive fees being earned over the related vesting period.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P29_S7	In addition, our Global Investment Management segment also earns success-based transaction fees with regard to buying or selling properties on certain funds and separate accounts.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P29_S8	Such revenue is recognized at the completion of a successful transaction and is not subject to any claw back provision.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	We earn development and incentive development fees in our Development Services segment.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	Development fees are generally based on a percentage of a defined cost measure and are recognized at the lower of the amount billed or the amount determined on a straight-line basis over the development period.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P30_S2	Incentive development fees are recognized when quantitative criteria have been met (such as specified leasing or budget targets) or, for those incentive fees based on qualitative criteria, upon approval of the fee by our clients.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	Certain incentive development fees allow us to share in the fair value of the developed real estate asset above cost.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	This sharing creates additional revenue potential to us with no exposure to loss other than opportunity cost.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P31_S2	Our incentive development fee revenue is not recognized to the extent that such revenue is subject to future performance contingencies, but rather once the contingency has been resolved.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P31_S3	The unique nature and complexity of each incentive fee requires us to use varying levels of judgment in determining the timing of revenue recognition.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	In establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables, we make assumptions with respect to future collectability.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	Our assumptions are based on an assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends, including the aging of receivables balances.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P32_S2	In addition to these assessments, in general, outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are more than 180 days overdue are evaluated for collectability and fully provided for if deemed uncollectible.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	Historically, our credit losses have generally been insignificant.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P33_S1	However, estimating losses requires significant judgment, and conditions may change or new information may become known after any periodic evaluation.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P33_S2	As a result, actual credit losses may differ from our estimates.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P33_S3	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majority-owned subsidiaries, as well as variable interest entities, or VIEs, in which we are the primary beneficiary.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P33_S4	The equity attributable to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries is shown separately in our consolidated balance sheets included elsewhere in this filing.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P33_S5	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	Our determination of the appropriate accounting method with respect to our VIEs, including co-investments with our clients, is based on Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2009-17, Consolidations (Topic 810): Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities .
1138118_12_ITEM7_P34_S1	This ASU incorporates Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) , issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, in June 2009.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P34_S2	The amendments in this ASU replace the quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation for determining which reporting entity, if any, has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with a primarily qualitative approach focused on identifying which reporting entity has both (1) the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact such entity s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from such entity that could potentially be significant to such entity.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P34_S3	The entity which satisfies these criteria is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	We determine if an entity is a VIE based on several factors, including whether the entity s total equity investment at risk upon inception is sufficient to finance the entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	We make judgments regarding the sufficiency of the equity at risk based first on a qualitative analysis, then a quantitative analysis, if necessary.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	We analyze any investments in VIEs to determine if we are the primary beneficiary.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	We consider a variety of factors in identifying the entity that holds the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance including, but not limited to, the ability to direct financing, leasing, construction and other operating decisions and activities.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P36_S2	In addition, we also consider the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions, to replace the manager and to sell or liquidate the entity.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P36_S3	We also have several co-investments in real estate investment funds which qualify for a deferral of the newer qualitative approach for analyzing potential VIEs.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P36_S4	We continue to analyze these investments under the former quantitative method incorporating various estimates, including estimated future cash flows, asset hold periods and discount rates, as well as estimates of the probabilities of various scenarios occurring.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	If the entity is a VIE, we then determine whether we consolidate the entity as the primary beneficiary.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	This determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary includes any impact of an upside economic interest in the form of a promote that we may have.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	A promote is an interest built into the distribution structure of the entity based on the entity s achievement of certain return hurdles.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	We consolidate any VIE of which we are the primary beneficiary (see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report) and disclose significant VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary, if any, as well as disclose our maximum exposure to loss related to VIEs that are not consolidated.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	We determine whether an entity is a VIE and, if so, whether it should be consolidated by utilizing judgments and estimates that are inherently subjective.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P39_S2	If we made different judgments or utilized different estimates in these evaluations, it could result in differing conclusions as to whether or not an entity is a VIE and whether or not to consolidate such entity.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P39_S3	If an entity is not a VIE, our determination of the appropriate accounting method with respect to our investments in limited partnerships, limited liability companies and other subsidiaries is based on voting control.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P39_S4	For our general partner interests, we are presumed to control (and therefore consolidate) the entity, unless the other limited partners have substantive rights that overcome this presumption of control.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P39_S5	These substantive rights allow the limited partners to remove the general partner with or without cause or to participate in significant decisions made in the ordinary course of the entity s business.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P39_S6	We account for our non-controlling general partner investments in these entities under the equity method.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P39_S7	This treatment also applies to our managing member interests in limited liability companies.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	Our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, but do not control, or entities which are variable interest entities in which we are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for under the equity method.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	Accordingly, our share of the earnings from these equity-method basis companies is included in consolidated net income.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P40_S2	All other investments held on a long-term basis are valued at cost less any impairment in value.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	Our determination of the appropriate accounting treatment for an investment in a subsidiary requires judgment of several factors, including the size and nature of our ownership interest and the other owners substantive rights to make decisions for the entity.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	If we were to make different judgments or conclusions as to the level of our control or influence, it could result in a different accounting treatment.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P41_S2	Accounting for an investment as either consolidated or using the equity method generally would have no impact on our net income or stockholders equity in any accounting period, but a different treatment would impact individual income statement and balance sheet items, as consolidation would effectively gross up our income statement and balance sheet.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P41_S3	If our evaluation of an investment accounted for using the cost method was different, it could result in our being required to account for an investment by consolidation or by the equity method.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	Under the cost method, the investor only records its share of the underlying entity s earnings to the extent that it receives dividends from the investee; when the dividends received by the investor exceed the investor s share of the investee s earnings subsequent to the date of the investor s investment, the investor records a reduction in the basis of its investment.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	Under the cost method, the investor does not record its share of losses of the investee.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P42_S2	Conversely, under either consolidation or equity method accounting, the investor effectively records its share of the underlying entity s net income or loss, or its guarantees of the underlying entity s debt.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P42_S3	Under either the equity or cost method, impairment losses are recognized upon evidence of other-than-temporary losses of value.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	When testing for impairment on investments that are not actively traded on a public market, we generally use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our investments and/or look to comparable activities in the marketplace.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow approach.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P43_S2	These assumptions include net asset values, internal rates of return, discount and capitalization rates, interest rates and financing terms, rental rates, timing of leasing activity, estimates of lease terms and related concessions, etc.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P43_S3	When determining if impairment is other-than-temporary, we also look to the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been less than cost as well as the financial condition and near-term prospects of each investment.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting, which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	In determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, we use a variety of valuation methods including present value, depreciated replacement cost, market values (where available) and selling prices less costs to dispose.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	We are responsible for determining the valuation of assets and liabilities and for the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	Assumptions must often be made in determining fair values, particularly where observable market values do not exist.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	Assumptions may include discount rates, growth rates, cost of capital, royalty rates, tax rates and remaining useful lives.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P47_S2	These assumptions can have a significant impact on the value of identifiable assets and accordingly can impact the value of goodwill recorded.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P47_S3	Different assumptions could result in different values being attributed to assets and liabilities.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P47_S4	Since these values impact the amount of annual depreciation and amortization expense, different assumptions could also impact our statement of operations and could impact the results of future impairment reviews.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	Acquisition), the Trammell Crow Company Acquisition in 2006 and the REIM Acquisitions in 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	Other intangible assets that have indefinite estimated useful lives and are not being amortized include certain management contracts identified in the REIM Acquisitions, a trademark, which was separately identified as a result of the 2001 Acquisition, as well as trade names separately identified as a result of the Insignia Acquisition and REIM Acquisitions.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P48_S2	The remaining other intangible assets primarily include customer relationships, management contracts and loan servicing rights, which are all being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging up to 20 years.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P48_S3	We are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	The goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step process.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	The first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P50_S1	We use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P50_S2	Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P50_S3	These assumptions include revenue growth rates, profit margin percentages, discount rates, etc.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered to not be impaired.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	The second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	The implied fair value of goodwill is determined similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination, by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one, over the estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P52_S2	Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business s fair value and the relative size of our goodwill, if different assumptions and estimates were used, it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	Our annual assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives has historically been completed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P53_S1	When we performed our required annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we determined that no impairment existed as the estimated fair value of our reporting units was in excess of their carrying value, after recording significant impairments during the year ended December 31, 2008 as described in prior disclosures.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P53_S2	Real Estate As of December 31, 2011, the carrying value of our total real estate assets was $460.1 million (6.4% of total assets).
1138118_12_ITEM7_P53_S3	The significant accounting policies and estimates with regard to our real estate assets relate to classification and impairment evaluation, cost capitalization and allocation, disposition of real estate and discontinued operations.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P53_S4	Classification and Impairment Evaluation With respect to our real estate assets, the Property, Plant and Equipment, Topic of FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, or Topic 360, establishes criteria to classify an asset as held for sale.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P53_S5	Assets included in real estate held for sale include only completed assets or land for sale in its present condition that meet all of Topic 360 s held for sale criteria.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P53_S6	All other real estate assets are classified in one of the following line items in our consolidated balance sheet: (i) real estate under development (current), which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of within one year of the balance sheet date; (ii) real estate under development (non-current), which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of more than one year from the balance sheet date; or (iii) real estate held for investment, which consists of land on which development activities have not yet commenced and completed assets or land held for disposition that do not meet the held for sale criteria.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	Real estate held for sale is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less cost to sell.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	If an asset s fair value less cost to sell, based on discounted future cash flows, management estimates or market comparisons, is less than its carrying amount, an allowance is recorded against the asset.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P54_S2	Determining an asset s fair value and the related allowance to record requires us to utilize judgment and estimates.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	Real estate under development and real estate held for investment are carried at cost less depreciation, as applicable.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	Buildings and improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, generally up to 39 years.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P55_S2	Tenant improvements included in real estate held for investment are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the terms of the respective leases.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P55_S3	Land improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, up to 15 years.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P55_S4	When indicators of impairment are present, real estate under development and real estate held for investment are evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset or market comparisons are less than the asset s carrying amount.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P55_S5	The amount of the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value, which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, management estimates or market comparisons.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P55_S6	Impairment charges of $1.7 million, $24.6 million and $28.8 million were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P55_S7	In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, we also recorded provisions for loss on real estate held for sale of $2.6 million, $2.3 million and $3.9 million, respectively.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	We evaluate each of our real estate assets on a quarterly basis in order to determine the classification of each asset in our consolidated balance sheet.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P56_S1	This evaluation requires judgment by us in considering certain criteria that must be evaluated under Topic 360, such as the estimated time to complete assets that are under development and the timeframe in which we expect to sell our real estate assets.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	The classification of real estate assets determines which real estate assets are to be depreciated as well as what method is used to evaluate and measure impairment.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P57_S1	Had we evaluated our assets differently, the balance sheet classification of such assets, depreciation expense and impairment losses could have been different.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	Cost Capitalization and Allocation When acquiring, developing and constructing real estate assets, we capitalize costs.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P58_S1	Capitalization begins when we determine that activities related to development have begun and ceases when activities are substantially complete and the asset is available for occupancy, which are timing decisions that require judgment.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P58_S2	Costs capitalized include pursuit costs, or pre-acquisition/pre-construction costs, taxes and insurance, interest, development and construction costs and costs of incidental operations.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P58_S3	We do not capitalize any internal costs when acquiring, developing and constructing real estate assets.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P58_S4	We expense transaction costs for acquisitions that qualify as a business in accordance with the Business Combinations Topic of the FASB ASC, or Topic 805.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P58_S5	Pursuit costs capitalized in connection with a potential development project that we have determined based on our judgment not to pursue are written off in the period that such determination is made.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P58_S6	A difference in the timing of when this determination is made could cause the pursuit costs to be expensed in a different period.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	At times, we purchase bulk land that we intend to sell or develop in phases.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P59_S1	The land basis allocated to each phase is based on the relative estimated fair value of the phases before construction.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P59_S2	We allocate construction costs incurred relating to more than one phase between the various phases; if the costs cannot be specifically attributed to a certain phase or the improvements benefit more than one phase, we allocate the costs between the phases based on their relative estimated sales values, where practicable, or other value methods as appropriate under the circumstances.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P59_S3	Relative allocations of the costs are revised as the sales value estimates are revised.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	When acquiring real estate with existing buildings, we allocate the purchase price between land, land improvements, building and intangibles related to in-place leases, if any, based on their relative fair values.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	model with lease-up assumptions as if the building was vacant upon acquisition.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	The fair value of in-place leases includes the value of lease intangibles for above or below-market rents and tenant origination costs, determined on a lease by lease basis using assumptions for market rates, absorption periods, lease commissions and tenant improvements.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P62_S1	The capitalized values for both lease intangibles and tenant origination costs are amortized over the term of the underlying leases.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P62_S2	Amortization related to lease intangibles is recorded as either an increase to or a reduction of rental income and amortization for tenant origination costs is recorded to amortization expense.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P62_S3	If we use different estimates in these valuations, the allocation of purchase price to each component could differ, which could cause the amount of amortization related to lease intangibles and tenant origination costs to be different, as well as depreciation of the related building and land improvements.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	Disposition of Real Estate Gains on disposition of real estate are recognized upon sale of the underlying project.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P63_S1	We evaluate each real estate sale transaction to determine if it qualifies for gain recognition under the full accrual method.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P63_S2	This evaluation requires us to make judgments and estimates in assessing whether a sale has been consummated, the adequacy of the buyer s investment, the subordination or collectability of any receivable related to the purchase, and whether we have transferred the usual risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer, with no substantial continuing involvement by us.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P63_S3	If the transaction does not meet the criteria for the full accrual method of profit recognition based on our assessment, we account for the sale based on an appropriate deferral method determined by the nature and extent of the buyer s investment and our continuing involvement.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P63_S4	In some cases, a deferral method could require the real estate asset and its related liabilities to remain on our balance sheet until the sale qualifies for a different deferral method or full accrual profit recognition.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	Discontinued Operations Topic 360 extends the reporting of a discontinued operation to a component of an entity, and further requires that a component be classified as a discontinued operation if the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	As defined in Topic 360, a component of an entity comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the rest of the entity.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P65_S1	Because each of our real estate assets is generally accounted for in a discrete subsidiary, many constitute a component of an entity under Topic 360, increasing the likelihood that the disposition of assets are required to be recognized and reported as operating profits and losses on discontinued operations in the periods in which they occur.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P65_S2	The evaluation of whether the component s cash flows have been eliminated and the level of our continuing involvement require judgment by us and a different assessment could result in items not being reported as discontinued operations.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with the Accounting for Income Taxes , Topic of the FASB ASC, or Topic 740.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P67_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P67_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P67_S2	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	Accounting for tax positions requires judgments, including estimating reserves for potential uncertainties.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P69_S1	We also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P70_S0	deferred tax assets that we believe will be realized in future periods.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P70_S1	While we believe the resulting tax balances as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with Topic 740, as applicable, the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P70_S2	See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information regarding income taxes.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	Unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside the United States, which have been, or are intended to be, permanently invested aggregated approximately $1.1 billion at December 31, 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P71_S1	Presently, we have not recorded an associated deferred tax liability.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	These earnings may become taxable upon a payment of a dividend or as a result of a sale or liquidation of the subsidiaries.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P72_S1	At this time, we do not have any plans to repatriate income from our foreign subsidiaries, however, to the extent that we are able to repatriate such earnings in a tax efficient manner, or in the event of a change in our capital situation or investment strategy that such funds became needed for funding our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P72_S2	Cash and cash equivalents owned by non-U.S. subsidiaries totaled $210.3 million at December 31, 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P72_S3	The following table sets forth items derived from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009:
1138118_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	EBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, while amounts shown for EBITDA, as adjusted, remove the impact of certain cash and non-cash charges related to acquisitions, cost containment and asset impairments.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P73_S1	Our management believes that both of these measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculations of EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, generally eliminate the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P73_S2	Such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P73_S3	As a result, our management uses these measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes, including as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive programs.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P73_S4	Additionally, we believe EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, are useful to investors to assist them in getting a more complete picture of our results from operations.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P73_S5	However, EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, are not recognized measurements under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and when analyzing our operating performance, readers should use EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P73_S6	Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P73_S7	Furthermore, EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for our management s discretionary use, as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P73_S8	The amounts shown for EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P73_S9	EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted for selected charges are calculated as follows:
1138118_12_ITEM7_P74_S0	Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010 We reported consolidated net income of $239.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 on revenue of $5.9 billion as compared to consolidated net income of $200.3 million on revenue of $5.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P74_S1	Our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by $790.1 million, or 15.4%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P74_S2	This increase was primarily driven by higher worldwide sales (up 24.2%), leasing (up 9.5%) and outsourcing (up 15.0%) activity.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P74_S3	Also contributing to the increase was revenue of $84.6 million attributable to the REIM Acquisitions in the current year.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P74_S4	Foreign currency translation had a $143.8 million positive impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P74_S5	Our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by $497.0 million, or 16.8%, during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P74_S6	Our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission basis, which substantially correlates with our transaction revenue performance.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P74_S7	Accordingly, the increase in transaction revenue led to a corresponding increase in commission accruals.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P74_S8	Higher salaries and related costs associated with our global property and facilities management contracts also contributed to the increase in cost of services in the current year.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P74_S9	Additionally, included in cost of services for the year ended December 31, 2011, were cost containment expenses of $20.0 million relating to severance costs incurred to calibrate our staffing levels to the current market environment.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P74_S10	Foreign currency translation had an $81.7 million negative impact on cost of services during the year ended December 31, 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P74_S11	Cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased to 58.5% for the year ended December 31, 2011 from 57.9% for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily driven by higher commission tranches achieved in the current year as a result of the increased transaction revenue and the aforementioned cost containment expenses.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P74_S12	Our operating, administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis increased by $275.0 million, or 17.1%, during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P74_S13	The increase was primarily driven by higher payroll-related costs, including bonuses, which resulted from our improved operating performance and the REIM Acquisitions.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P74_S14	Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011 also included $66.7 million of transaction and integration costs incurred in connection with the REIM Acquisitions.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P74_S15	Foreign currency translation had a $44.2 million negative impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P74_S16	Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 31.9% for the year ended December 31, 2011 from 31.4% for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily driven by the aforementioned costs incurred relative to the REIM Acquisitions.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P74_S17	Our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by $7.3 million, or 6.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P74_S18	This increase was primarily attributable to higher amortization expense relative to intangibles acquired in the REIM Acquisitions and other in-fill acquisitions completed in the current year.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P74_S19	The increase in amortization expense was partially offset by lower depreciation expense partially stemming from property dispositions in our Global Investment Management and Development Services segments in the current year.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P74_S20	Our gain on disposition of real estate on a consolidated basis was $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P74_S21	These gains primarily resulted from activity within our Development Services segment.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P75_S0	Our equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis increased by $78.2 million, or 294.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P75_S1	This increase was primarily driven by higher equity earnings associated with gains on property sales within our Development Services segment in the current year.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P75_S2	Also contributing to the increase were lower impairment charges reported by our Global Investment Management segment in the current year.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P75_S3	Our other income on a consolidated basis was $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 and was reported within our Global Investment Management segment.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P75_S4	This income primarily represented net realized and unrealized gains and losses related to trading securities, which we acquired in our acquisition of CRES in the current year.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P75_S5	Our consolidated interest income increased by $1.0 million, or 12.2%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P75_S6	This increase was mainly driven by higher interest income reported in our Americas segment in the current year.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P75_S7	Our consolidated interest expense decreased by $40.9 million, or 21.4%, during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P75_S8	The decrease was primarily due to lower interest expense associated with our credit agreement due to debt repayments made in the second half of 2010 and lower interest rates resulting from our refinancing activities in the fourth quarter of 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P75_S9	The lower interest expense more than offset the increase in interest expense attributable to additional borrowings made to finance the REIM Acquisitions and the new British pound sterling A-1 term loan facility entered into in the current year.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P75_S10	This overall net decrease was also partially offset by interest expense incurred related to the $350.0 million of 6.625% senior notes issued on October 8, 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P75_S11	Our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was $189.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $130.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P75_S12	Our effective tax rate from continuing operations, after adjusting pre-tax income to remove the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, increased to 44.8% for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 40.5% for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P75_S13	The changes in our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate were primarily the result of a significant increase in income reported in the current year and a change in our mix of domestic and foreign earnings (losses).
1138118_12_ITEM7_P75_S14	In addition, certain of the transaction costs incurred in connection with the REIM Acquisitions in the current year were non-deductible.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P75_S15	Our consolidated income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, was $49.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $14.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P75_S16	The income in the current year was reported in our Global Investment Management and Development Services segments and mostly related to gains from property sales, which were largely attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P75_S17	The income in the prior year was reported in our Development Services segment and mostly related to gains from property sales.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P75_S18	Our net income attributable to non-controlling interests on a consolidated basis was $51.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to a net loss attributable to non-controlling interests of $44.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P75_S19	This activity primarily reflects our non-controlling interests share of income and losses within our Global Investment Management and Development Services segments.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P75_S20	Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 We reported consolidated net income of $200.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 on revenue of $5.1 billion as compared to consolidated net income of $33.3 million on revenue of $4.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P75_S21	Our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by $949.5 million, or 22.8%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P76_S0	worldwide sales (up 51.5%), leasing (up 29.3%) and outsourcing (up 8.5%) activity.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P76_S1	Foreign currency translation had a $44.1 million positive impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P76_S2	Our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by $512.3 million, or 20.9%, during the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P77_S0	As previously mentioned, our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission and bonus basis, which substantially correlates with our revenue performance.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P77_S1	Accordingly, the increase in revenue led to a corresponding increase in commission and bonus accruals.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P77_S2	In addition, commission reinstatements contributed to the increase.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P77_S3	Higher salaries and related costs associated with our property and facilities management contracts also contributed to an increase in cost of services in 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P77_S4	Foreign currency translation had a $31.0 million negative impact on cost of services during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P77_S5	Cost of services as a percentage of revenue decreased from 58.8% for the year ended December 31, 2009 to 57.9% for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P77_S6	This decrease was primarily the result of the strong improvement in overall revenue and a shift in the mix of revenue, with transaction revenue comprising a greater portion of the total than in 2009.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P77_S7	Our operating, administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis increased by $224.1 million, or 16.2%, during the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P77_S8	The increase was primarily driven by higher payroll-related costs, including bonuses, which resulted from our improved operating performance as well as the restoration of salaries to pre-recession levels in the third quarter of 2010 and substantially restored bonus target levels in the fourth quarter of 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P77_S9	Also contributing to the increase was higher carried interest incentive compensation expense accruals and increased marketing and travel costs in support of our growing revenue in 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P78_S0	Foreign currency translation had a $10.8 million negative impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P78_S1	Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 31.4% for the year ended December 31, 2010 from 33.2% for the year ended December 31, 2009, reflective of our cost containment efforts during the recessionary period of 2008 and 2009 as well as the strong improvement in overall revenue.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P78_S2	Our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by $8.9 million, or 9.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P78_S3	This increase was primarily attributable to higher depreciation expense within our Global Investment Management segment driven by the consolidation of several assets due to the adoption of ASU 2009-17 in 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P78_S4	Our gain on disposition of real estate on a consolidated basis was $7.3 million and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P78_S5	These gains resulted from activity within our Development Services segment.

1138118_12_ITEM7_P78_S7	The increase in equity income in 2010 was primarily driven by higher equity earnings associated with gains on property sales within our Development Services segment and higher equity earnings in our Global Investment Management segment largely resulting from a fund liquidation.

1138118_12_ITEM7_P97_S0	In recent years, the global credit markets have experienced unprecedented tightening, which could affect both the availability and cost of our funding sources in the future.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P98_S0	On February 15, 2011, we announced that we had entered into definitive agreements to acquire the majority of the real estate investment management business of Netherlands-based ING for approximately $940 million in cash.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P98_S1	The acquisitions included substantially all of the ING REIM operations in Europe and Asia, as well as substantially all of CRES, its U.S.-based global real estate listed securities business.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P98_S2	On February 15, 2011, we also announced that we expected to acquire approximately $55 million of CRES co-investments from ING and potentially additional interests in other funds managed by ING REIM Europe and ING REIM Asia.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P98_S3	On July 1, 2011, we acquired CRES for $323.9 million and CRES co-investments from ING for an aggregate amount of $58.6 million, using borrowings from our tranche D term loan facility under our credit agreement to finance these transactions.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P98_S4	On October 3, 2011, we acquired ING REIM s operations in Asia for $45.6 million and three ING REIM Asia co-investments from ING for an aggregate amount of $13.9 million, using borrowings from our tranche C term loan facility under our credit agreement to finance these transactions.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P98_S5	On October 31, 2011, we completed the ING REIM Europe portion of the REIM Acquisitions, acquiring ING REIM s operations in Europe for $442.5 million and one co-investment from ING for $7.4 million, using borrowings from our tranche C term loan facility under our credit agreement, cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to finance these transactions.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P98_S6	Our initial estimate of $940 million in total purchase price for the REIM Acquisitions has been reduced by approximately $47 million for certain fund and separate account management contracts that were not acquired and for certain balance sheet adjustments.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P98_S7	There is a possibility of an additional closing of approximately $80 million and co-investments of up to $68 million in the future related to our acquisition of ING REIM Europe.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P99_S0	During 2003 and 2006, we required substantial amounts of equity and debt financing to fund our acquisitions of Insignia and Trammell Crow Company.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P99_S1	In the past two years, we also conducted two debt offerings.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P99_S2	The first, in 2009, was part of a capital restructuring in response to the global economic recession, and the second, in 2010, was to take advantage of low interest rates and term availability.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P99_S3	Absent extraordinary transactions such as these and the equity offerings we completed during the unprecedented global capital markets disruption in 2008 and 2009, we historically have not sought external sources of financing and have relied on our internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital, capital expenditure and investment requirements.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P99_S4	In the absence of such extraordinary events, our management anticipates that our cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future, but at a minimum for the next 12 months.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P100_S0	As evidenced above, from time to time, we consider potential strategic acquisitions.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P100_S1	We believe that any future significant acquisitions that we may make most likely would require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P100_S2	In the past, we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that we believed to be reasonable.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P100_S3	However, it is possible that we may not be able to find acquisition financing on favorable terms, or at all, in the future if we decide to make any further material acquisitions.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P101_S0	Our long-term liquidity needs, other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases, generally are comprised of two elements.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P102_S0	The first is the repayment of the outstanding and anticipated principal amounts of our long-term indebtedness.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P103_S0	long-term cash flow from operations will be sufficient to repay our long-term debt when it comes due.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P103_S1	If our cash flow is insufficient, then we expect that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P103_S2	We cannot make any assurances that such refinancing or amendments would be available on attractive terms, if at all.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P104_S0	The second long-term liquidity need is the repayment of obligations under our pension plans in the United Kingdom.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P104_S1	Our subsidiaries based in the United Kingdom maintain two contributory defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in the plans.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P104_S2	With respect to these plans, our historical policy has been to contribute annually, an amount to fund pension cost as actuarially determined and as required by applicable laws and regulations.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P104_S3	Our contributions to these plans are invested and, if these investments do not perform in the future as well as we expect, we will be required to provide additional funding to cover any shortfall.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P104_S4	During 2007, we reached agreements with the active members of these plans to freeze future pension plan benefits.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P104_S5	In return, the active members became eligible to enroll in the CBRE Group Personal Pension Plan, a defined contribution plan in the United Kingdom.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P104_S6	The underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans included in pension liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets was $60.9 million and $40.0 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P104_S7	We expect to contribute a total of $5.2 million to fund our pension plans for the year ending December 31, 2012.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P105_S0	On June 10, 2009, we completed the sale of 13,440,860 shares of our Class A common stock through a direct placement to Paulson Co. Inc., which raised approximately $97.6 million of net proceeds.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P105_S1	On June 11, 2009, we completed the sale of 5,682,684 shares of our Class A common stock through an at-the-market offering program, which raised approximately $48.8 million of net proceeds.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P105_S2	The net proceeds from these offerings were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of some of our outstanding indebtedness under our previous credit agreement.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P105_S3	In November 2009, we completed the sale of 28,289,960 shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to an at-the-market offering program, which raised approximately $293.8 million of net proceeds.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P105_S4	We used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of debt.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P105_S5	Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $361.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $255.4 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P105_S6	The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in the current year was primarily due to higher bonuses, commissions and income taxes paid in the current year.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P105_S7	These items were partially offset by an increase in bonus accruals in the current year, activity associated with securities acquired in our acquisition of CRES, a greater decrease in real estate held for sale and under development in the current year and a greater increase in receivables in the prior year.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P105_S8	Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $616.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $402.9 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P105_S9	The increase was primarily due to improved operating performance, higher net payments to vendors and to employees under our deferred compensation plan in 2009 and an increase in commission, bonus and income tax accruals in 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P105_S10	These items were partially offset by a greater increase in receivables and higher bonuses paid in 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P106_S0	Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $480.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $417.8 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P106_S1	The increase was primarily driven by cash paid for the REIM Acquisitions and higher capital expenditures in the current year.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P106_S2	These increases were partially offset by net proceeds received from the disposition of real estate held for investment and higher distributions received from investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in the current year.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P107_S0	Net cash used in investing activities totaled $62.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of $56.9 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P107_S1	The decrease was primarily driven by higher net proceeds received in 2010 from the disposition of real estate held for investment and from the sale of servicing rights and other assets.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P107_S2	A decrease in restricted cash and lower contributions to investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries along with higher distributions received from investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2010 also contributed to the decrease.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P107_S3	These decreases were partially offset by the use of more cash in 2010 for capital expenditures and earn out payments associated with in-fill acquisitions.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P107_S4	Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $711.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $784.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P107_S5	The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to net proceeds from senior secured loans in the current year to finance the REIM Acquisitions and the new British pound sterling A-1 term loan facility entered into in the current year versus significant net repayments of our senior secured term loans in the prior year.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P107_S6	These items were partially offset by higher net repayments of notes payable on real estate within our Development Services segment and greater distributions to non-controlling interests in the current year.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P107_S7	Net cash used in financing activities totaled $784.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $476.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P107_S8	The sharp decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to higher net repayments of our senior secured term loans in 2010 as well as proceeds received in 2009 in connection with equity offerings and the issuance of our 11.625% senior subordinated notes.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P107_S9	Also contributing to the decrease were higher net repayments of notes payable on real estate within our Development Services segment in 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P107_S10	These decreases were partially offset by proceeds received in 2010 from the issuance of our 6.625% senior notes.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P107_S11	The following is a summary of our various contractual obligations and other commitments as of December 31, 2011:
1138118_12_ITEM7_P108_S0	(1) See Note 13 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P108_S1	Figures do not include scheduled interest payments.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P108_S2	Assuming each debt obligation is held until maturity, we estimate that we will make the following interest payments (dollars in thousands): 2012 $132,108; 2013 to 2014 $254,447; 2015 to 2016 $235,468 and thereafter $157,500.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P108_S3	The interest payments on the variable rate debt have been calculated at the interest rate in effect at December 31, 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P109_S0	(2) See Note 14 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P110_S0	(3) See Note 15 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P111_S0	(4) Because these obligations are related, either wholly or partially, to the future retirement of our employees and such retirement dates are not predictable, an undeterminable portion of this amount will be paid in years one through five.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P112_S0	(5) See Note 12 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P112_S1	Figures do not include scheduled interest payments.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P112_S2	The notes (primarily construction loans) have either fixed or variable interest rates, ranging from 1.85% to 8.75% at December 31, 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P112_S3	In general, interest is drawn on the underlying loan and subsequently paid with proceeds received upon the sale of the real estate project.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P113_S0	(6) Due to the nature of guarantees, payments could be due at any time upon the occurrence of certain triggering events including default.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P113_S1	Accordingly, all guarantees are reflected as expiring in less than one year.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P114_S0	(7) Includes $59.4 million related to our Global Investment Management segment, all of which is expected to be funded in 2012 and $14.4 million related to our Development Services segment (callable at any time).
1138118_12_ITEM7_P115_S0	(8) As of December 31, 2011, our current and non-current tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, totaled $92.4 million.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P116_S0	We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P117_S0	(9) Represents outstanding reserves for claims under certain insurance programs, which are included in other current and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2011 set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P117_S1	Due to the nature of this item, payments could be due at any time upon the occurrence of certain events.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P117_S2	Accordingly, the entire balance has been reflected as expiring in less than one year.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P118_S0	Our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness and other obligations.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P118_S1	In addition, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or for other purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P118_S2	If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our debt, would increase.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P119_S0	Since 2001, we have maintained credit facilities with Credit Suisse Group AG, or CS, and other lenders to fund strategic acquisitions and to provide for our working capital needs.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P119_S1	On November 10, 2010, we entered into a new credit agreement (as amended, the Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks led by CS, as administrative and collateral agent, to completely refinance our previous credit facilities.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P119_S2	On March 4, 2011, we entered into an amendment to our Credit Agreement to, among other things, increase flexibility to various covenants to accommodate the REIM Acquisitions and to maintain the availability of the $800.0 million incremental facility under the Credit Agreement.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P119_S3	On March 4, 2011, we also entered into an incremental assumption agreement to allow for the establishment of new tranche C and tranche D term loan facilities.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P119_S4	On November 10, 2011, we entered into an incremental assumption agreement led jointly by HSBC Bank USA, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC to allow for the establishment of a new tranche A-1 term loan facility, which also reduced the $800.0 million incremental facility under the Credit Agreement.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P120_S0	payments, which began on December 30, 2011 and continue through March 31, 2016, with the balance payable on May 10, 2016; (4) a $300.0 million tranche B term loan facility requiring quarterly principal payments, which began on December 31, 2010 and continue through September 30, 2016, with the balance payable on November 10, 2016; (5) a $400.0 million tranche C term loan facility requiring quarterly principal payments, which began on September 30, 2011 and continue through December 31, 2017, with the balance payable on March 4, 2018; (6) a $400.0 million tranche D term loan facility requiring quarterly principal payments, which began on September 30, 2011 and continue through June 30, 2019, with the balance payable on September 4, 2019 and (7) an accordion provision which provides the ability to borrow additional funds under an incremental facility.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P120_S1	The incremental facility is equivalent to the sum of $800.0 million and the aggregate amount of all repayments of term loans and permanent reductions of revolver commitments under the Credit Agreement.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P120_S2	However, at no time may the sum of all outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement exceed $2.95 billion.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P121_S0	On November 10, 2011, we utilized the incremental facility to issue the tranche A-1 term loan facility.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P121_S1	In regards to the tranche C and tranche D term loan facilities, we had up to 180 days from the date we entered into the related incremental assumption agreement to draw on these facilities during which period we were required to pay a fee on the unused portions of each facility.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P121_S2	On June 30, 2011, we drew down $400.0 million of the tranche D term loan facility to finance the CRES portion of the REIM Acquisitions, which closed on July 1, 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P121_S3	On August 31, 2011, we drew down $400.0 million of the tranche C term loan facility, part of which was used to finance the ING REIM Asia portion of the REIM Acquisitions, which closed on October 3, 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P121_S4	The remaining borrowings were used to finance the acquisition of ING REIM s operations in Europe, which closed on October 31, 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P121_S5	The revolving credit facility allows for borrowings outside of the U.S., with sub-facilities of $5.0 million available to one of our Canadian subsidiaries, $35.0 million in aggregate available to one of our Australian and one of our New Zealand subsidiaries and $50.0 million available to one of our U.K. subsidiaries.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P121_S6	Additionally, outstanding borrowings under these sub-facilities may be up to 5.0% higher as allowed under the currency fluctuation provision in the Credit Agreement.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P122_S0	Borrowings under the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2011 bear interest at varying rates, based at our option, on either the applicable fixed rate plus 1.65% to 3.15% or the daily rate plus 0.65% to 2.15% as determined by reference to our ratio of total debt less available cash to EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement).
1138118_12_ITEM7_P122_S1	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had $44.8 million and $17.5 million, respectively, of revolving credit facility principal outstanding with related weighted average interest rates of 4.3% and 3.5%, respectively, which are included in short-term borrowings in the consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P122_S2	As of December 31, 2011, letters of credit totaling $17.2 million were outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P122_S3	These letters of credit were primarily issued in the normal course of business as well as in connection with certain insurance programs and reduce the amount we may borrow under the revolving credit facility.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P123_S0	Borrowings under the term loan facilities as of December 31, 2011 bear interest, based at our option, on the following: for the tranche A and A-1 term loan facilities, on either the applicable fixed rate plus 2.00% to 3.75% or the daily rate plus 1.00% to 2.75%, as determined by reference to our ratio of total debt less available cash to EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement), for the tranche B term loan facility, on either the applicable fixed rate plus 3.25% or the daily rate plus 2.25%, for the tranche C term loan facility, on either the applicable fixed rate plus 3.25% or the daily rate plus 2.25% and for the tranche D term loan facility, on either the applicable fixed rate plus 3.50% or the daily rate plus 2.50%.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P123_S1	A term loan facility principal outstanding and $296.3 million and $299.2 million, respectively, of tranche B term loan facility principal outstanding, which are included in the consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P123_S2	As of December 31, 2011, we also had $285.1 million of tranche A-1 term loan facility principal outstanding and $398.0 million of both tranche C and tranche D term loan facilities principal outstanding, which are included in the consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P124_S0	The purpose of these interest rate swap agreements is to hedge potential changes to our cash flows due to the variable interest nature of our senior secured term loan facilities.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P124_S1	The total notional amount of these interest rate swap agreements is $400.0 million, with $200.0 million expiring in October 2017 and $200.0 million expiring in September 2019.
1138118_12_ITEM7_P124_S2	There was no hedge ineffectiveness for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P0_S0	STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES All other schedules are omitted because they are either not applicable, not required or the information required is included in the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes thereto.

1138118_12_ITEM8_P1_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1138118_12_ITEM8_P1_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P1_S7	Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

1138118_12_ITEM8_P1_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P2_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P2_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P2_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P2_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P3_S0	CBRE Group, Inc. and subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P3_S1	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of CBRE Group, Inc. also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the Acquired Business.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P3_S2	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of CBRE Group, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P3_S3	Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

1138118_12_ITEM8_P9_S0	CBRE GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P9_S1	Nature of Operations CBRE Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation formerly known as CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc. (which may be referred to in these financial statements as the company , we , us and our ), was incorporated on February 20, 2001.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P9_S2	We are the world s largest commercial real estate services firm, based on 2011 revenue, with leading full-service operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P9_S3	We offer a full range of services to occupiers, owners, lenders and investors in office, retail, industrial, multi-family and other types of commercial real estate.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P9_S4	As of December 31, 2011, we operated more than 300 offices worldwide, excluding affiliate offices, with approximately 34,000 employees providing commercial real estate services under the CBRE brand name, investment management services under the CBRE Global Investors brand name and development services under the Trammell Crow brand name.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P9_S5	Our business is focused on several competencies, including commercial property and corporate facilities management, occupier and property/agency leasing, property sales, valuation, real estate investment management, commercial mortgage origination and servicing, capital markets (equity and debt) solutions, development services and proprietary research.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P9_S6	We generate revenues from contractual management fees and on a per project or transactional basis.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P9_S7	Our contractual, fee-for-services businesses, which generally involve facilities management, property management, mortgage loan servicing and investment management, represented approximately 39% of our 2011 revenue.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P9_S8	Effective October 3, 2011, we changed our name from CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc. , to CBRE Group, Inc. 2.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P9_S9	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majority-owned subsidiaries, as well as variable interest entities (VIEs) in which we are the primary beneficiary and other subsidiaries of which we have control.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P9_S10	The equity attributable to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries is shown separately in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P9_S11	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P10_S0	Our determination of the appropriate accounting method with respect to our VIEs, including co-investments with our clients, is based on Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2009-17, Consolidations (Topic 810): Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities .
1138118_12_ITEM8_P10_S1	No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) , issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in June 2009.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P10_S2	The amendments in this ASU replace the quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation for determining which reporting entity, if any, has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with a primarily qualitative approach focused on identifying which reporting entity has both (1) the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact such entity s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from such entity that could potentially be significant to such entity.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P10_S3	The entity which satisfies these criteria is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P11_S0	We determine if an entity is a VIE based on several factors, including whether the entity s total equity investment at risk upon inception is sufficient to finance the entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P11_S1	We make judgments regarding the sufficiency of the equity at risk based first on a qualitative analysis, then a quantitative analysis, if necessary.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P12_S0	We analyze any investments in VIEs to determine if we are the primary beneficiary.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P13_S0	economic performance including, but not limited to, the ability to direct financing, leasing, construction and other operating decisions and activities.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P13_S1	In addition, we also consider the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions, to replace the manager and to sell or liquidate the entity.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P13_S2	We also have several co-investments in real estate investment funds which qualify for a deferral of the newer qualitative approach for analyzing potential VIEs.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P13_S3	We continue to analyze these investments under the former quantitative method incorporating various estimates, including estimated future cash flows, asset hold periods and discount rates, as well as estimates of the probabilities of various scenarios occurring.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P14_S0	If the entity is a VIE, we then determine whether we consolidate the entity as the primary beneficiary.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P14_S1	This determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary includes any impact of an upside economic interest in the form of a promote that we may have.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P15_S0	A promote is an interest built into the distribution structure of the entity based on the entity s achievement of certain return hurdles.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P16_S0	We consolidate any VIE of which we are the primary beneficiary (see Note 4) and disclose significant VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary, if any, as well as disclose our maximum exposure to loss related to VIEs that are not consolidated.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P16_S1	We determine whether an entity is a VIE and, if so, whether it should be consolidated by utilizing judgments and estimates that are inherently subjective.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P16_S2	If we made different judgments or utilized different estimates in these evaluations, it could result in differing conclusions as to whether or not an entity is a VIE and whether or not to consolidate such entity.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P16_S3	If an entity is not a VIE, our determination of the appropriate accounting method with respect to our investments in limited partnerships, limited liability companies and other subsidiaries is based on voting control.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P16_S4	For our general partner interests, we are presumed to control (and therefore consolidate) the entity, unless the other limited partners have substantive rights that overcome this presumption of control.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P16_S5	These substantive rights allow the limited partners to remove the general partner with or without cause or to participate in significant decisions made in the ordinary course of the entity s business.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P16_S6	We account for our non-controlling general partner investments in these entities under the equity method.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P16_S7	This treatment also applies to our managing member interests in limited liability companies.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P16_S8	Our determination of the appropriate accounting method for all other investments in subsidiaries is based on the amount of influence we have (including our ownership interest) in the underlying entity.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P16_S9	Those other investments where we have the ability to exercise significant influence (but not control) over operating and financial policies of such subsidiaries (including certain subsidiaries where we have less than 20% ownership) are accounted for using the equity method.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P16_S10	We eliminate transactions with such equity method subsidiaries to the extent of our ownership in such subsidiaries.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P16_S11	Accordingly, our share of the earnings or losses of these equity method subsidiaries is included in consolidated net income.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P16_S12	All of our remaining investments are carried at cost.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P17_S0	Under either the equity or cost method, impairment losses are recognized upon evidence of other-than-temporary losses of value.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P18_S0	When testing for impairment on investments that are not actively traded on a public market, we generally use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our investments and/or look to comparable activities in the marketplace.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P18_S1	Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow approach.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P18_S2	These assumptions include net asset values, internal rates of return, discount and capitalization rates, interest rates and financing terms, rental rates, timing of leasing activity, estimates of lease terms and related concessions, etc.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P18_S3	When determining if impairment is other-than-temporary, we also look to the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been less than cost as well as the financial condition and near-term prospects of each investment.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P19_S0	Estimates, Risks and Uncertainties Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.), which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P19_S1	These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, and reported amounts of revenue and expenses.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P19_S2	Such estimates include the value of goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets, accounts receivable, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, retirement and other post-employment benefits, among others.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P19_S3	These estimates and assumptions are based on management s best estimates and judgment.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P19_S4	Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including consideration of the macroeconomic environment, and adjusts such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P19_S5	Highly volatile credit, equity and foreign currency markets and a tentative and uneven global economic recovery have increased the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P19_S6	As future events and their effects cannot be forecast with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P19_S7	Changes in those estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P20_S0	The fair value of our goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets is impacted by economic and capital market conditions as well as our stock price.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P20_S1	Property sales and leasing activity is affected by economic and employment growth, capital markets liquidity, credit availability and pricing, business and investor confidence, and inflation levels.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P20_S2	Adverse trends involving any or all of these factors could reduce incentive-based revenue as well as property values and sales volume.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P20_S3	Such adverse economic conditions could cause declines in the estimated future discounted cash flows expected for our reporting units.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P20_S4	A major or sustained decline in our future cash flows and/or the current economic conditions could result in additional impairment charges.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P21_S0	The recoverability of our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries has been impacted by the continuing effects of the global financial crisis.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P21_S1	This was initially manifested in sharply reduced property sales activity and decreasing property values throughout 2009.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P21_S2	As liquidity subsequently improved, transaction volume revived in 2010 and 2011, but remained well below levels experienced in 2006 and 2007.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P21_S3	Property values also generally began to rebound, but price appreciation has been most significant in top-tier assets and in the largest, most liquid markets.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P21_S4	The assumptions utilized in our recoverability analysis reflect our belief that the recovery from the severe downturn will continue to be slow and gradual and that challenging market conditions could result in further write-downs, especially if heightened capital markets turmoil returns.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P22_S0	The recoverability of the carrying value of our investments in real estate is impacted by general conditions in the U.S. economy and commercial real estate market.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P22_S1	Market fundamentals in the primary property types that we develop/own weakened significantly in late 2008 and throughout 2009.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P22_S2	A high unemployment rate negatively impacted office markets as companies deferred occupancy decisions and placed space on the market for sublease.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P22_S3	Weak industrial production adversely affected warehouse and distribution markets.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P22_S4	The retail sector was negatively affected by declining consumer confidence, and retailers experienced financial difficulty.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P22_S5	These trends improved in 2010 and 2011 as real estate market conditions recovered, and property sales revived from the depressed levels of 2009.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P22_S6	Capitalization rates have stabilized and contracted modestly as both investor confidence and liquidity returned to the commercial real estate market.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P22_S7	However, if conditions in the broader economy, capital markets, local, regional or global commercial real estate markets decline sharply once again, we may be required to record additional impairment charges.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P23_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents generally consist of cash and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of less than three months.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P24_S0	and 2010 is cash and cash equivalents of $208.1 million and $26.1 million, respectively, from consolidated funds and other entities, which is not available for general corporate use.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P24_S1	We also manage certain cash and cash equivalents as an agent for our investment and property and facilities management clients.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P24_S2	These amounts are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets (see Note 19).
1138118_12_ITEM8_P25_S0	Restricted Cash Included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 is restricted cash of $67.1 million and $52.3 million, respectively.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P25_S1	The balances primarily include restricted cash set aside to cover funding obligations as required by contracts executed by us in the normal course of business, including escrow accounts held in our Development Services segment.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P26_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist principally of trade receivables and interest-bearing investments.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P26_S1	Users of real estate services account for a substantial portion of trade receivables and collateral is generally not required.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P26_S2	The risk associated with this concentration is limited due to the large number of users and their geographic dispersion.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P27_S0	We place substantially all of our interest-bearing investments with major financial institutions and triple A rated money market funds and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P28_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P28_S1	Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment is computed primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging up to 15 years.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P29_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the term of their associated leases, excluding options to renew, since such leases generally do not carry prohibitive penalties for non-renewal.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P30_S0	We capitalize expenditures that materially increase the life of our assets and expense the costs of maintenance and repairs.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P30_S1	We review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P30_S2	If this review indicates that such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment is recognized in the period the changes occur and represents the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P30_S3	We did not recognize an impairment loss related to property and equipment in 2011, 2010 or 2009.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P31_S0	Certain costs related to the development or purchase of internal-use software are capitalized.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P31_S1	Internal computer software costs that are incurred in the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P31_S2	Direct consulting costs as well as payroll and related costs, which are incurred during the development stage of a project are capitalized and amortized over a three-year period when placed into production.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P32_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting, which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P32_S1	The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P33_S0	balance has resulted from our acquisition of CBRE Services, Inc. (CBRE) in 2001 (the 2001 Acquisition), our acquisition of Insignia Financial Group, Inc. (Insignia) in 2003 (the Insignia Acquisition), our acquisition of the Trammell Crow Company in 2006 (the Trammell Crow Company Acquisition) and our acquisition of substantially all of the ING Group N.V. (ING) Real Estate Investment Management (REIM) operations in Europe and Asia, as well as substantially all of Clarion Real Estate Securities (CRES) in 2011 (collectively referred to as the REIM Acquisitions).
1138118_12_ITEM8_P33_S1	Other intangible assets that have indefinite estimated useful lives and are not being amortized include certain management contracts identified in the REIM Acquisitions, a trademark, which was separately identified as a result of the 2001 Acquisition, as well as trade names separately identified as a result of the Insignia Acquisition and REIM Acquisitions.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P33_S2	The remaining other intangible assets primarily include customer relationships, management contracts and loan servicing rights, which are all being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging up to 20 years.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P33_S3	We are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P34_S0	The goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step process.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P35_S0	The first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P35_S1	We use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P35_S2	Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P35_S3	These assumptions include revenue growth rates, profit margin percentages, discount rates, etc.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P36_S0	If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered to not be impaired.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P36_S1	If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P37_S0	The second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P37_S1	The implied fair value of goodwill is determined similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination, by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one, over the estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P37_S2	Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business s fair value and the relative size of our goodwill, if different assumptions and estimates were used, it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P38_S0	Deferred Financing Costs Costs incurred in connection with financing activities are generally deferred and amortized over the terms of the related debt agreements ranging up to ten years.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P38_S1	Amortization of these costs is charged to interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P38_S2	Total deferred financing costs, net of accumulated amortization, included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were $51.5 million and $34.1 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P38_S3	In connection with the credit agreement we entered into on November 10, 2010, we wrote off financing costs of $16.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, including $12.1 million of credit agreement amendment fees paid in November 2010 and $4.6 million of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with our prior credit agreement.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P38_S4	In addition, in October 2010, we wrote off $1.4 million of unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with debt repayments made.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P38_S5	In connection with the March 24, 2009 amendment and restatement to our prior credit agreement, we wrote off financing costs of $29.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, which included the write-off of $18.1 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and $11.2 million of credit agreement amendment fees paid in March 2009.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P38_S6	All of these write-offs were included in write-off of financing costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P38_S7	See Note 13 for additional information on activities associated with our debt.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P39_S0	Revenue Recognition We record commission revenue on real estate sales generally upon close of escrow or transfer of title, except when future contingencies exist.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P39_S1	Real estate commissions on leases are generally recorded in revenue when all obligations under the commission agreement are satisfied.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P40_S0	Terms and conditions of a commission agreement may include, but are not limited to, execution of a signed lease agreement and future contingencies including tenant occupancy, payment of a deposit or payment of a first month s rent (or a combination thereof).
1138118_12_ITEM8_P40_S1	As some of these conditions are outside of our control and are often not clearly defined, judgment must be exercised in determining when such required events have occurred in order to recognize revenue.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P41_S0	A typical commission agreement provides that we earn a portion of a lease commission upon the execution of the lease agreement by the tenant and landlord, with the remaining portion(s) of the lease commission earned at a later date, usually upon tenant occupancy or payment of rent.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P41_S1	The existence of any significant future contingencies results in the delay of recognition of corresponding revenue until such contingencies are satisfied.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P41_S2	For example, if we do not earn all or a portion of the lease commission until the tenant pays its first month s rent, and the lease agreement provides the tenant with a free rent period, we delay revenue recognition until rent is paid by the tenant.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P42_S0	Property management revenues are generally based upon percentages of the revenue or base rent generated by the entities managed or the square footage managed.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P42_S1	These fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related management agreements.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P43_S0	Investment management fees are based predominantly upon a percentage of the equity deployed on behalf of our limited partners.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P43_S1	Fees related to our indirect investment management programs are based upon a percentage of the fair value of those investments.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P43_S2	These fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related investment management agreements.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P44_S0	Our Global Investment Management segment earns performance-based incentive fees with regard to many of its investments.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P44_S1	Such revenue is recognized at the end of the measurement periods when the conditions of the applicable incentive fee arrangements have been satisfied and following the expiration of any potential claw back provision.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P44_S2	With many of these investments, our Global Investment Management team has participation interests in such incentive fees, which are commonly referred to as carried interest.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P44_S3	This carried interest expense is generally accrued for based upon the probability of such performance-based incentive fees being earned over the related vesting period.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P44_S4	In addition, our Global Investment Management segment also earns success-based transaction fees with regard to buying or selling properties on certain funds and separate accounts.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P44_S5	Such revenue is recognized at the completion of a successful transaction and is not subject to any claw back provision.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P45_S0	Appraisal fees are recorded after services have been rendered.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P45_S1	and we have no significant remaining obligations for performance in connection with the transaction, while loan servicing fees are recorded in revenue as monthly principal and interest payments are collected from mortgagors.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P45_S2	Other commissions, consulting fees and referral fees are recorded as revenue at the time the related services have been performed, unless significant future contingencies exist.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P46_S0	Development services and project management services generate fees from development and construction management projects.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P46_S1	Some development and construction management and project management assignments are subject to agreements that describe the calculation of fees and when we earn such fees.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P46_S2	The earnings terms of these agreements dictate when we recognize the related revenue.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P47_S0	Generally development fees are recognized based on the lower of the amount billed or the amount determined on a straight-line basis over the development period.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P48_S0	We may earn incentive fees for project management services based upon achievement of certain performance criteria as set forth in the project management services agreement.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P49_S0	development fees by reaching specified time table, leasing, budget or value creation targets, as defined in the relevant development services agreement.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P50_S0	Certain incentive development fees allow us to share in the fair value of the developed real estate asset above cost.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P50_S1	This sharing creates additional revenue potential to us with no exposure to loss other than opportunity cost.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P50_S2	We recognize such fees when the specified target is attained and fees are deemed collectible.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P50_S3	For projects where we operate as a general contractor, fees are generally recognized using the percentage-of-completion method based on costs incurred as a percentage of total expected costs.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P51_S0	We record deferred income to the extent that cash payments have been received in accordance with the terms of underlying agreements, but such amounts have not yet met the criteria for revenue recognition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P51_S1	We recognize such revenues when the appropriate criteria are met.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P51_S2	We account for certain reimbursements (primarily salaries and related charges) mainly related to our facilities and property management operations as revenue.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P51_S3	Reimbursement revenue is recognized when the underlying reimbursable costs are incurred.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P52_S0	In establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables, we make assumptions with respect to future collectability.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P52_S1	Our assumptions are based on an assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends, including the aging of receivables balances.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P52_S2	In addition to these assessments, in general, outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are more than 180 days overdue are evaluated for collectability and fully provided for if deemed uncollectible.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P53_S0	Historically, our credit losses have generally been insignificant.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P53_S1	However, estimating losses requires significant judgment, and conditions may change or new information may become known after any periodic evaluation.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P53_S2	As a result, actual credit losses may differ from our estimates.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P54_S0	Real Estate Classification and Impairment Evaluation We classify real estate in accordance with the criteria of the Property, Plant and Equipment Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) (Topic 360) as follows: (i) real estate held for sale, which includes completed assets or land for sale in its present condition that meet all of Topic 360 s held for sale criteria, (ii) real estate under development (current), which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of within one year of the balance sheet date; (iii) real estate under development (non-current), which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of more than one year from the balance sheet date; or (iv) real estate held for investment, which consists of land on which development activities have not yet commenced and completed assets or land held for disposition that do not meet the held for sale criteria.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P54_S1	Any asset reclassified from real estate held for sale to real estate under development (current or non-current) or real estate held for investment is recorded individually at the lower of its fair value at the date of the reclassification or its carrying amount before it was classified as held for sale, adjusted (in the case of real estate held for investment) for any depreciation that would have been recognized had the asset been continuously classified as real estate held for investment.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P54_S2	Real estate held for sale is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P54_S3	If an asset s fair value less cost to sell, based on discounted future cash flows, management estimates or market comparisons, is less than its carrying amount, an allowance is recorded against the asset.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P54_S4	Real estate under development and real estate held for investment are carried at cost less depreciation, as applicable.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P54_S5	Buildings and improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, generally up to 39 years.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P55_S0	estate held for investment are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or terms of the respective leases.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P55_S1	Land improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, up to 15 years.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P55_S2	When indicators of impairment are present, real estate under development and real estate held for investment are evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset or market comparisons are less than the asset s carrying amount.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P55_S3	The amount of the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value, which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, management estimates or market comparisons.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P56_S0	Cost Capitalization and Allocation When acquiring, developing and constructing real estate assets, we capitalize costs.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P56_S1	Capitalization begins when the activities related to development have begun and ceases when activities are substantially complete and the asset is available for occupancy.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P56_S2	Costs capitalized include pursuit costs, or pre-acquisition/pre-construction costs, taxes and insurance, interest, development and construction costs and costs of incidental operations.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P56_S3	We do not capitalize any internal costs when acquiring, developing and constructing real estate assets.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P56_S4	We expense transaction costs for acquisitions that qualify as a business in accordance with the Business Combinations Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 805).
1138118_12_ITEM8_P56_S5	Pursuit costs capitalized in connection with a potential development project that we have determined not to pursue are written off in the period that determination is made.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P57_S0	At times, we purchase bulk land that we intend to sell or develop in phases.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P57_S1	The land basis allocated to each phase is based on the relative estimated fair value of the phases before construction.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P57_S2	We allocate construction costs incurred relating to more than one phase between the various phases; if the costs cannot be specifically attributed to a certain phase or the improvements benefit more than one phase, we allocate the costs between the phases based on their relative estimated sales values, where practicable, or other value methods as appropriate under the circumstances.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P57_S3	Relative allocations of the costs are revised as the sales value estimates are revised.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P58_S0	When acquiring real estate with existing buildings, we allocate the purchase price between land, land improvements, building and intangibles related to in-place leases, if any, based on their relative fair values.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P58_S1	The fair values of acquired land and buildings are determined based on an estimated discounted future cash flow model with lease-up assumptions as if the building was vacant upon acquisition.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P58_S2	The fair value of in-place leases includes the value of lease intangibles for above or below-market rents and tenant origination costs, determined on a lease by lease basis.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P58_S3	The capitalized values for both lease intangibles and tenant origination costs are amortized over the term of the underlying leases.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P58_S4	Amortization related to lease intangibles is recorded as either an increase to or a reduction of rental income and amortization for tenant origination costs is recorded to amortization expense.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P59_S0	Disposition of Real Estate Gains on disposition of real estate are recognized upon sale of the underlying project.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P59_S1	We evaluate each real estate sale transaction to determine if it qualifies for gain recognition under the full accrual method.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P59_S2	If the transaction does not meet the criteria for the full accrual method of profit recognition based on our assessment, we account for a sale based on an appropriate deferral method determined by the nature and extent of the buyer s investment and our continuing involvement.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P60_S0	component have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P61_S0	As defined in Topic 360, a component of an entity comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the rest of the entity.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P61_S1	Because each of our real estate assets is generally accounted for in a discrete subsidiary, many constitute a component of an entity under Topic 360, increasing the likelihood that the disposition of assets that we hold for sale in the ordinary course of business must be reported as a discontinued operation unless we have significant continuing involvement in the operations of the asset after its disposition.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P61_S2	Furthermore, operating profits and losses on such assets are required to be recognized and reported as operating profits and losses on discontinued operations in the periods in which they occur.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P62_S0	The costs of business promotion and advertising are expensed as incurred.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P62_S1	Business promotion and advertising costs of $42.5 million, $37.5 million and $27.5 million were included in operating, administrative and other expenses for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P63_S0	The financial statements of subsidiaries located outside the U.S. are generally measured using the local currency as the functional currency.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P63_S1	The assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date, and income and expenses are translated at the average monthly rate.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P63_S2	The resulting translation adjustments are included in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of equity.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P63_S3	Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the results of operations.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P63_S4	The aggregate transaction losses included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $0.4 million, $4.0 million and $0.6 million, respectively.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P64_S0	As required by FASB ASC Topic 815 Derivatives and Hedging , we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P64_S1	The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P65_S0	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P65_S1	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P65_S2	Derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P66_S0	Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P67_S0	We may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of our risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or we elect not to apply hedge accounting.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P67_S1	In all cases, we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and, accordingly, do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P68_S0	Comprehensive Income (Loss) Comprehensive income (loss) consists of net income (loss) and other comprehensive (loss) income.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P69_S0	translation adjustments, unrealized (losses) gains on interest rate swaps and interest rate caps, unrealized holding gains on available for sale securities and other pension liability adjustments.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P69_S1	Foreign currency translation adjustments exclude any income tax effect given that earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries are deemed to be reinvested for an indefinite period of time (see Note 16).
1138118_12_ITEM8_P70_S0	Marketable Securities We account for investments in marketable debt and equity securities in accordance with the Investments Debt and Equity Securities Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 320).
1138118_12_ITEM8_P70_S1	We determine the appropriate classification of debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P70_S2	Marketable securities we acquire with the intent to generate a profit from short-term movements in market prices would be classified as trading securities.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P70_S3	Debt securities are classified as held to maturity when we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P70_S4	Marketable equity and debt securities not classified as trading or held to maturity are classified as available for sale.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P71_S0	Trading securities are carried at their fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in net income.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P71_S1	Available for sale securities are carried at their fair value and any difference between cost and fair value is recorded as unrealized gain or loss, net of income taxes, and is reported as accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated statement of equity.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P72_S0	Premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the effective interest method.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P72_S1	Realized gains and losses and declines in value expected to be other-than-temporary on available for sale securities have not been significant.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P73_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P73_S1	Interest and dividends on securities classified as available for sale are included in interest income.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P74_S0	Our wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE Capital Markets is a Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) approved Multifamily Program Plus Seller/Servicer and an approved Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) Aggregation and Negotiated Transaction Seller/Servicer.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P74_S1	In addition, CBRE Capital Markets wholly-owned subsidiary Multifamily Capital is an approved Fannie Mae Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS) Seller/Servicer and CBRE Capital Markets wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE HMF is a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) approved Non-Supervised Federal Housing Authority (FHA) Title II Mortgagee, an approved Multifamily Accelerated Processing (MAP) lender and an approved Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) issuer of mortgage-backed securities (MBS).
1138118_12_ITEM8_P75_S0	Under these arrangements, before loans are originated through proceeds from warehouse lines of credit, we obtain either a contractual loan purchase commitment from either Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae or a confirmed forward trade commitment for the issuance and purchase of a Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae MBS that will be secured by the loans.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P75_S1	The warehouse lines of credit are generally repaid within a one-month period when Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae buys the loans or upon settlement of the Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae MBS, while we retain the servicing rights.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P76_S0	Loans are funded at the prevailing market rates.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P77_S0	We elect the fair value option for all warehouse receivables.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P77_S1	At December 31, 2011 and 2010, all of the warehouse receivables included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were either under commitment to be purchased by Freddie Mac or had confirmed forward trade commitments for the issuance and purchase of Fannie Mae mortgage backed securities that will be secured by the underlying loans.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P78_S0	We also assume or purchase certain servicing assets.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P78_S1	Servicing assets are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value in other intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are amortized in proportion to and over the estimated period that net servicing income is expected to be received based on projections and timing of estimated future net cash flows.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P78_S2	Our recording of loan servicing rights at their fair value resulted in net gains, which have been reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P78_S3	The amount of loan servicing rights recognized during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_12_ITEM8_P79_S0	Mortgage servicing rights do not actively trade in an open market with readily available observable prices; therefore, fair value is determined based on certain assumptions and judgments, including the estimation of the present value of future cash flows realized from servicing the underlying mortgage loans.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P79_S1	Management s assumptions include the benefits of servicing (servicing fee income and interest on escrow deposits), inflation, the cost of servicing, prepayment rates, delinquencies, discount rate and the estimated life of servicing cash flows.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P79_S2	The assumptions used are subject to change based on management s judgments and estimates of changes in future cash flows and interest rates, among other things.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P79_S3	The key assumptions used during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 in measuring fair value were as follows:
1138118_12_ITEM8_P79_S4	The estimated fair value of our mortgage servicing rights was $111.1 million and $77.8 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P79_S5	We did not incur any impairment charges related to our servicing rights during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 or 2009.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P79_S6	Included in revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations are contractually specified servicing fees from loans serviced for others of $28.2 million, $21.7 million and $16.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively and late fees/ancillary income earned from loans serviced for others of $1.5 million, $0.5 million and $0.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P80_S0	Accounting for Broker Draws As part of our recruitment efforts relative to new U.S. brokers, we offer a transitional broker draw arrangement.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P81_S0	sufficient to allow him or her to earn sustainable commissions.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P81_S1	This program is intended to provide the broker with a minimal amount of cash flow to allow adequate time for his or her training as well as time for him or her to develop business relationships.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P81_S2	Similar to traditional salaries, the broker draws are paid irrespective of the actual revenues generated by the broker.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P81_S3	Often these broker draws represent the only form of compensation received by the broker.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P81_S4	Furthermore, it is not our general policy to pursue collection of unearned broker draws paid under this arrangement.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P81_S5	As a result, we have concluded that broker draws are economically equivalent to salaries paid and accordingly charge them to compensation as incurred.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P82_S0	The broker is also entitled to earn a commission on completed revenue transactions.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P82_S1	This amount is calculated as the commission that would have been payable under our full commission program, less any amounts previously paid to the broker in the form of a draw.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P83_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We account for all employee awards under the fair value recognition provisions of the Compensation Stock Compensation Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 718).
1138118_12_ITEM8_P83_S1	Topic 718 requires the measurement of compensation cost at the grant date, based upon the estimated fair value of the award, and requires amortization of the related expense over the employee s requisite service period.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P83_S2	See Note 15 for additional information on our stock-based compensation plans.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P84_S0	Basic income per share attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. is computed by dividing net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P84_S1	The computation of diluted income per share attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. generally further assumes the dilutive effect of potential common shares, which include stock options and certain contingently issuable shares.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P84_S2	Contingently issuable shares consist of non-vested stock awards.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P85_S0	Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with the Accounting for Income Taxes Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 740).
1138118_12_ITEM8_P86_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P86_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P86_S2	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P87_S0	Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P88_S0	Self-Insurance Our wholly-owned captive insurance company, which is subject to applicable insurance rules and regulations, insures our exposure related to workers compensation insurance provided to employees and purchases excess coverage from an unrelated insurance carrier.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P88_S1	We purchase general liability and automotive insurance through an unrelated insurance carrier.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P88_S2	The captive insurance company reinsures the related deductibles.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P88_S3	The captive insurance company also insures deductibles relating to professional indemnity claims.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P88_S4	Given the nature of these types of claims, it may take several years for resolution and determination of the cost of these claims.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P88_S5	We are required to estimate the cost of these claims in our financial statements.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P89_S0	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, our reserves for claims under these insurance programs were $51.8 million and $35.4 million, respectively, which were included in other current and other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P89_S1	Of these amounts, $16.1 million and $8.2 million, respectively, represented our estimated current liabilities as of December 31, 2011 and 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P89_S2	Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Limited Life Subsidiaries As of December 31, 2011, the estimated settlement value of non-controlling interests in our consolidated limited life subsidiaries approximates the carrying value of $79.3 million, which was included in non-controlling interests in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P89_S3	As of December 31, 2010, the estimated settlement value of non-controlling interests in our consolidated limited life subsidiaries was $110.1 million, as compared to the carrying value of $107.1 million, which was included in non-controlling interests in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P90_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-29, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P90_S1	ASU 2010-29 specifies that when a public company completes a business combination, the company should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P90_S2	The update also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures under Topic 805 to include a description of the nature and amount of material, non-recurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the pro forma revenue and earnings.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P91_S0	The requirements of ASU 2010-29 are effective for business combinations that occur on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P91_S1	We adopted this ASU during the year ended December 31, 2011 (see Note 3) and do not believe the adoption of this update had a material impact on the disclosure requirements for our consolidated financial statements.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P92_S0	In April 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-03, Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860): Reconsideration of Effective Control for Repurchase Agreements.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P93_S0	ASU 2011-03 specifies when an entity may or may not recognize a sale upon the transfer of financial assets subject to repurchase agreements.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P93_S1	That determination is based, in part, on whether the entity has maintained effective control over the transferred financial assets.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P93_S2	The requirements of ASU 2011-03 will be effective for the first interim or annual period beginning on or after December 15, 2011, with early adoption prohibited.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P93_S3	We do not believe the adoption of this update will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P94_S0	In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P94_S1	These amendments were issued to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
1138118_12_ITEM8_P94_S2	ASU 2011-04 changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements, particularly for level 3 fair value measurements.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P94_S3	This ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption prohibited.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P94_S4	We do not believe the adoption of this update will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P95_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income.

1138118_12_ITEM8_P97_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassification of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P97_S1	This ASU defers indefinitely certain requirements from ASU 2011-05 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P97_S2	ASU 2011-05 and ASU 2011-12 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted, and requires retrospective application for all periods presented.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P97_S3	We elected to adopt these ASUs early and have provided the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income in two separate but consecutive statements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P97_S4	We do not believe the adoption of these updates had a material impact on the disclosure requirements for our consolidated financial statements.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P98_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P98_S1	This ASU gives companies the option to perform a qualitative assessment to first assess whether the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P98_S2	If an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P99_S0	ASU 2011-08 is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P99_S1	We do not believe the adoption of this update will have a material impact on the disclosure requirements for our consolidated financial statements.

1138118_12_ITEM8_P100_S1	This ASU requires that a reporting entity that ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary that is in substance real estate as a result of default on the subsidiary s nonrecourse debt would apply FASB ASC Subtopic 360-20, Property, Plant, and Equipment Real Estate Sales , to determine whether to derecognize assets and liabilities of that subsidiary.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P101_S0	ASU 2011-10 is effective prospectively for a deconsolidation event that takes place in fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after June 15, 2012.

1138118_12_ITEM8_P103_S0	REIM Acquisitions On February 15, 2011, we announced that we had entered into definitive agreements to acquire the majority of the real estate investment management business of Netherlands-based ING for approximately $940 million in cash.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P103_S1	The acquisitions included substantially all of the ING REIM operations in Europe and Asia, as well as substantially all of CRES, its U.S.-based global real estate listed securities business (collectively referred to as ING REIM).
1138118_12_ITEM8_P103_S2	On February 15, 2011, the Company also announced that it expected to acquire approximately $55 million of CRES co-investments from ING and potentially additional interests in other funds managed by ING REIM Europe and ING REIM Asia.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P103_S3	Upon completion of the acquisitions (collectively referred to as the REIM Acquisitions), ING REIM became part of our Global Investment Management segment (which conducts business through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, CBRE Global Investors, an independently operated business segment).
1138118_12_ITEM8_P103_S4	We completed the REIM Acquisitions in order to significantly enhance our ability to meet the needs of institutional investors across global markets with a full spectrum of investment programs and strategies.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P104_S0	The Company secured borrowings of $800.0 million of new term loans to finance the REIM Acquisitions (see Note 13).
1138118_12_ITEM8_P104_S1	Of this amount, $400.0 million was drawn on June 30, 2011 to finance the CRES portion of the REIM Acquisitions, which closed on July 1, 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P104_S2	On August 31, 2011, the Company drew down the remaining $400.0 million, part of which was used to finance the ING REIM Asia portion of the REIM Acquisitions, which closed on October 3, 2011, and the remainder, along with cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility, was used to finance the ING REIM Europe portion of the REIM Acquisitions, which closed on October 31, 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P104_S3	The following represents a summary of the purchase price for the REIM Acquisitions and the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired (dollars in thousands):
1138118_12_ITEM8_P105_S0	In connection with our acquisition of CRES, we acquired CRES co-investments from ING in three funds (CRES Funds) for an aggregate purchase price of $58.6 million, which has been included above.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P105_S1	We determined that the CRES Funds were not variable interest entities and accordingly determined the method of accounting based upon voting control.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P105_S2	The limited partners/members of the CRES Funds lack substantive rights that would overcome our presumption of control.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P105_S3	Accordingly, we began consolidating the CRES Funds as of the acquisition date of July 1, 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P105_S4	Included in the consolidation of the CRES Funds on July 1, 2011 was $182.9 million of non-controlling interests.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P105_S5	In connection with the REIM Acquisitions, we also acquired three ING REIM Asia co-investments from ING for an aggregate amount of $13.9 million on October 3, 2011 and one ING REIM Europe co-investment for $7.4 million on October 31, 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P105_S6	Our initial estimate of $940 million in total purchase price for the REIM Acquisitions has been reduced by approximately $47 million for certain fund and separate account management contracts that were not acquired and for certain balance sheet adjustments.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P105_S7	There is a possibility of an additional closing of approximately $80 million and co-investments of up to $68 million in the future related to our acquisition of ING REIM Europe.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P106_S0	The preliminary purchase accounting adjustments related to the REIM Acquisitions have been recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P106_S1	The excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired has been recorded to goodwill.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P106_S2	The goodwill arising from the REIM Acquisitions consists largely of the synergies and economies of scale expected from combining the operations acquired from ING with ours.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P106_S3	Only $8.3 million of the goodwill recorded in connection with the REIM Acquisitions is deductible for tax purposes.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P107_S0	Given the complexity of the transaction, the calculation of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired, primarily intangible assets and income tax items, is still preliminary.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P107_S1	The purchase price allocation is expected to be completed as soon as practicable, but no later than one year from the acquisition date.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P107_S2	The following table summarizes the aggregate estimated fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in the REIM Acquisitions (dollars in thousands):
1138118_12_ITEM8_P108_S0	The following is a summary of the preliminary estimate of the intangible assets not subject to amortization that were acquired in connection with the REIM Acquisitions (dollars in thousands):
1138118_12_ITEM8_P109_S0	The following is a summary of the preliminary estimate of the amortizable intangible assets acquired in connection with the REIM Acquisitions (dollars in thousands): The consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 includes revenue, operating income and net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. of $84.6 million, $15.7 million and $9.1 million, respectively, attributable to the REIM Acquisitions.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P109_S1	This does not include direct transaction and integration costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2011 of $66.7 million in connection with the REIM Acquisitions.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P109_S2	Unaudited pro forma results, assuming the REIM Acquisitions had occurred as of January 1, 2010 for purposes of the 2011 and 2010 pro forma disclosures, are presented below.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P109_S3	They include certain adjustments for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, including $14.1 million and $25.6 million, respectively, of increased amortization expense as a result of intangible assets acquired in the REIM Acquisitions, $18.9 million and $32.8 million, respectively, of additional interest expense as a result of debt incurred to finance the REIM Acquisitions, the removal of $73.0 million of direct costs incurred by us and ING related to the REIM Acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2011, and the tax impact in both years of the pro forma adjustments.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P109_S4	These unaudited pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of what operating results would have been had the REIM Acquisitions occurred on January 1, 2010 and may not be indicative of future operating results (dollars in thousands, except share data):
1138118_12_ITEM8_P110_S0	Variable Interest Entities A consolidated subsidiary (the Venture) in our Global Investment Management segment sponsored investments by third-party investors in eight commercial properties through the formation of tenant-in-common limited liability companies and Delaware Statutory Trusts (collectively referred to as the Entities ) that are owned by the third-party investors.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P110_S1	The Venture also formed and is a member of a limited liability company for each property that serves as master tenant (Master Tenant).
1138118_12_ITEM8_P110_S2	Each Master Tenant leases the property from the Entities through a master lease agreement.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P111_S0	that most significantly impact the economic performance of the Entities.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P111_S1	As a result, the Entities were deemed to be variable interest entities since the third-party investors holding the equity investment at risk in the Entities do not direct the day-to-day activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the properties held by the Entities.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P111_S2	The Venture has made and may continue to make voluntary contributions to each of these properties to support their operations beyond the cash flow generated by the properties themselves.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P111_S3	As of the most recent reconsideration date, such financial support has been significant enough that the Venture was deemed to be the primary beneficiary of each entity.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P111_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Venture funded $0.2 million of financial support to the Entities.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P111_S5	The Entities were initially consolidated by the Venture upon adoption of ASU 2009-17 on January 1, 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P111_S6	The Entities assets and associated mortgage notes payable aggregated $251.0 million and $221.5 million, respectively, and were recorded based on their fair value at adoption.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P111_S7	We did not recognize a gain or loss on the initial consolidation of these Entities.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P111_S8	The assets of the Entities are the sole collateral for the mortgage notes payable and other liabilities of the Entities and as such, the creditors and equity investors of these Entities have no recourse to our assets held outside of these Entities.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P112_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2011, five of the original eight commercial properties were sold.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P112_S1	Operating results relating to the Entities for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 include the following (dollars in thousands): Investments in real estate of $61.3 million and $243.0 million and nonrecourse mortgage notes payable of $60.9 million ($1.2 million of which is current) and $223.1 million ($34.9 million of which is current) are included in real estate assets held for investment and notes payable on real estate, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P112_S2	In addition, non-controlling interests of $1.6 million and $20.6 million in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, are attributable to the Entities.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P113_S0	We hold variable interests in certain VIEs in our Global Investment Management and Development Services segments which are not consolidated as it was determined that we are not the primary beneficiary.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P113_S1	Our involvement with these entities is in the form of equity co-investments and fee arrangements.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P113_S2	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, our maximum exposure to loss related to the VIE s which are not consolidated was as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_12_ITEM8_P114_S0	The Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 820) defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P114_S1	Topic 820 also establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P114_S2	This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P114_S3	The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:
1138118_12_ITEM8_P115_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P116_S0	Level 2 Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P117_S0	Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P117_S1	This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P117_S2	There were no significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P117_S3	The following tables present the fair value of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2011 and 2010:
1138118_12_ITEM8_P118_S0	Fair value measurements for our available for sale securities are obtained from independent pricing services which utilize observable market data that may include quoted market prices, dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. treasury yield curve, trading levels, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the instrument s terms and conditions.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P119_S0	The trading securities and securities sold, not yet purchased are primarily in the U.S. and are generally valued at the last reported sales price on the day of valuation or, if no sales occurred on the valuation date, at the mean of the bid and asked prices on such date.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P119_S1	The fair values of the warehouse receivables are calculated based on already locked in security buy prices.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P119_S2	At December 31, 2011 and 2010, all of the warehouse receivables included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were either under commitment to be purchased by Freddie Mac or had confirmed forward trade commitments for the issuance and purchase of Fannie Mae mortgage backed securities that will be secured by the underlying warehouse lines of credit (See Note 2).
1138118_12_ITEM8_P119_S3	These assets are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as all inputs are readily observable.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P120_S0	The valuation of interest rate swaps is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P120_S1	This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P121_S0	The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P121_S1	The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate forward curves.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P122_S0	To comply with the provisions of Topic 820, we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P123_S0	In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we have considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P124_S0	estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by us and our counterparties.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P124_S1	However, as of December 31, 2011, we have determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P124_S2	As a result, we have determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P124_S3	The following tables are a summary of our available for sale and trading securities (dollars in thousands):
1138118_12_ITEM8_P125_S0	The net carrying value and estimated fair value of debt securities at December 31, 2011, by contractual maturity, are shown below.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P126_S0	Actual repayment dates may differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay obligations.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P127_S0	We did not record any significant dividends or interest income related to marketable securities for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P127_S1	We did not hold any investments in trading securities during 2009 and 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P127_S2	The portion of net gains and losses for the year ending December 31, 2011 relating to trading securities still held at December 31, 2011 is calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_12_ITEM8_P127_S3	The following non-recurring fair value measurements were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 (dollars in thousands):
1138118_12_ITEM8_P128_S0	The fair value measurements employed for our impairment evaluations were generally based on a discounted cash flow approach and/or review of comparable activities in the market place.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P128_S1	Inputs used in these evaluations included risk-free rates of return, estimated risk premiums as well as other economic variables.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P129_S0	Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded write-downs of $5.6 million, of which $0.1 million were attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P129_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2011, $5.5 million of the investment write-downs were reported in our Global Investment Management segment and $0.1 million were reported in our Development Services segment.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P129_S2	These write-downs were primarily driven by a decrease in the estimated holding period of certain assets.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P129_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded write-downs of $11.8 million, of which $3.8 million were attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P129_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2010, $9.4 million of the investments write-downs were reported in our Global Investment Management segment and driven by a decrease in the estimated holding period of certain assets.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P129_S5	In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred an additional $1.2 million of impairment charges in each of our Global Investment Management and Development Services segments, all driven by a decline in value of several investments attributable to slower than expected leasing.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P129_S6	During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded investment write-downs of $35.7 million, of which $9.2 million were attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P129_S7	During the year ended December 31, 2009, $10.7 million of the investment write-downs were reported in our Global Investment Management segment and were primarily driven by a decrease in the estimated holding period of certain assets.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P129_S8	In addition, $7.0 million of investment write-downs were reported in our Development Services segment, primarily resulting from the weak economic conditions, including high unemployment and slow leasing.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P129_S9	Lastly, during the year ended December 31, 2009, we incurred an additional $18.0 million of impairment charges, mainly attributable to declines in value of several investments, primarily as a result of significant capital market turmoil.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P129_S10	Of the additional impairment charges noted above, $9.9 million was reported in our Global Investment Management segment and $8.1 million was reported in our Development Services segment.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P129_S11	All of our impairment charges related to investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries were included in equity income (loss) from unconsolidated subsidiaries in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P130_S0	When we performed our impairment analysis, the assumptions utilized reflected our outlook for the commercial real estate industry and the impact on our business.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P130_S1	This outlook incorporated our belief that market conditions deteriorated and that these challenging conditions could persist for some time.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P131_S0	Real Estate During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded charges of $4.3 million, including provisions for losses on real estate held for sale and impairment charges on real estate held for investment.

1138118_12_ITEM8_P133_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded provisions for losses on real estate held for sale of $2.6 million.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P133_S1	These charges reduced the carrying value of certain assets to their fair value, less cost to sell, primarily due to reduced selling prices resulting from a decrease in the estimated holding period of certain assets.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P133_S2	Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded impairment charges of $1.7 million related to real estate held for investment, which were attributable to continued challenging market conditions.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P133_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded charges of $26.9 million, including impairment charges on real estate held for investment and provisions for losses on real estate held for sale.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P133_S4	Of this amount, $23.8 million was attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P134_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded impairment charges of $24.6 million related to nine real estate projects primarily due to a decrease in the estimated holding period of several of the projects and continued capital market disruption.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P134_S1	Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded provisions for losses on real estate held for sale of $2.3 million to reduce the carrying values of two office buildings, an operating hotel and a land parcel to their fair value less cost to sell, primarily due to reduced expected selling prices resulting from continued challenging market conditions.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P134_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded charges of $32.7 million, including impairment charges on real estate held for investment and provision for losses on real estate held for sale.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P134_S3	Of this amount, $27.0 million was attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P135_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded impairment charges of $28.8 million related to 13 projects where the carrying value was not recoverable primarily due to a decrease in the estimated holding periods of the projects.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P135_S1	Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded provision for losses on real estate held for sale of $3.9 million to reduce the carrying values of a condominium project and two pieces of land to their fair value less cost to sell, primarily due to reduced selling prices resulting from market conditions.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P135_S2	All of the abovementioned charges were reported in our Development Services segment and included within operating, administrative and other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, with the exception of a $1.3 million provision for loss on real estate for the year ended December 31, 2011, which was included within activity from discontinued operations.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P136_S0	If conditions in the broader economy, commercial real estate industry, specific markets or product types in which we operate worsen, we may be required to evaluate additional projects or re-evaluate previously impaired projects for potential impairment.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P136_S1	These evaluations could result in additional impairment charges, which may be material.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P137_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2010 we recorded a $0.3 million impairment charge on a note receivable secured by real estate, due to a decrease in value of the borrower s real estate project, the proceeds from the sale of which would be used to repay the note receivable.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P137_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded a $5.9 million impairment charge on two notes receivable secured by real estate as a result of the borrower defaulting on the notes.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P137_S2	Of this amount, $5.4 million was attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P137_S3	These defaults resulted from the borrowers noncompliance with certain terms of the note agreements.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P137_S4	As a result, we accepted assignment of the underlying real estate assets in lieu of foreclosing under our security deeds.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P137_S5	The impairment charge we recorded represents the difference between the carrying amounts of the notes and the fair value of the real estate assets acquired.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P137_S6	This transaction also resulted in a non-cash reclassification of $17.3 million from notes receivable to real estate held for investment during the year ended December 31, 2009.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P138_S0	All of our impairment charges associated with notes receivable were included in operating, administrative and other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations within our Development Services segment.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P138_S1	FASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments also requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P138_S2	Our financial instruments are as follows: Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash : These balances include cash and cash equivalents as well as restricted cash with maturities of less than three months.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P138_S3	The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P139_S0	Receivables, less Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: Due to their short-term nature, fair value approximates carrying value.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P139_S1	Warehouse Receivables: These balances are carried at fair value based on market prices at the balance sheet date.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P139_S2	Trading and Available for Sale Securities: These investments are carried at their fair value.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P139_S3	Securities Sold, not yet Purchased: These liabilities are carried at their fair value.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P139_S4	Short-Term Borrowings : The majority of this balance represents our revolving credit facility and our warehouse lines of credit outstanding for CBRE Capital Markets.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P139_S5	Due to the short-term nature and variable interest rates of these instruments, fair value approximates carrying value (see Note 13).
1138118_12_ITEM8_P139_S6	Senior Secured Term Loans : Based upon information from third-party banks, the estimated fair value of our senior secured term loans was approximately $1.7 billion at December 31, 2011, which approximates their actual carrying value at December 31, 2011 (See Note 13).
1138118_12_ITEM8_P139_S7	Interest Rate Swaps : These liabilities are carried at their fair value as calculated by using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative (see Note 6).
1138118_12_ITEM8_P139_S8	11.625% Senior Subordinated Notes : Based on dealers quotes, the estimated fair value of our 11.625% senior subordinated notes was $504.3 million at December 31, 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P139_S9	Their actual carrying value totaled $439.0 million at December 31, 2011 (see Note 13).
1138118_12_ITEM8_P140_S0	6.625% Senior Notes : Based on dealers quotes, the estimated fair value of our 6.625% senior notes was $364.9 million at December 31, 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P140_S1	Their actual carrying value totaled $350.0 million at December 31, 2011 (see Note 13).
1138118_12_ITEM8_P140_S2	Notes Payable on Real Estate: As of December 31, 2011, the carrying value of our notes payable on real estate was $372.9 million (See Note 12).
1138118_12_ITEM8_P141_S0	These borrowings mostly have floating interest rates at spreads over a market rate index.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P141_S1	It is likely that some portion of our notes payable on real estate have fair values lower than actual carrying values.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P141_S2	Given our volume of notes payable and the cost involved in estimating their fair value, we determined it was not practicable to do so.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P141_S3	Additionally, only $13.6 million of these notes payable are recourse to us as of December 31, 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P142_S0	Derivative Financial Instruments We are exposed to certain risks arising from both our business operations and economic conditions.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P142_S1	We manage economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of our debt funding and by using derivative financial instruments.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P142_S2	Specifically, we enter into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P142_S3	Our derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of our known or expected cash payments principally related to our borrowings.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P142_S4	Our objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P142_S5	To accomplish this objective, we primarily use interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P143_S0	In March 2011, we entered into five interest rate swap agreements, all with effective dates in October 2011, and immediately designated them as cash flow hedges.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P143_S1	The purpose of these interest rate swap agreements is to hedge potential changes to our cash flows due to the variable interest nature of our senior secured term loan facilities.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P143_S2	The total notional amount of these interest rate swap agreements is $400.0 million, with $200.0 million expiring in October 2017 and $200.0 million expiring in September 2019.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P144_S0	The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P144_S1	There was no hedge ineffectiveness for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P145_S0	The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the balance sheet and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P145_S1	As of December 31, 2011, there is $39.9 million included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets related to these interest rate swaps, which will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on our senior secured term loan facilities.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P145_S2	During the next twelve months, we estimate that $10.2 million will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P145_S3	The following table presents the fair value of our interest rate swaps as well as their classification on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2011 (dollars in thousands):
1138118_12_ITEM8_P146_S0	The following table presents the effect of our interest rate swaps on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 (dollars in thousands):
1138118_12_ITEM8_P147_S0	accelerated by the lender, then we could also be declared in default on our derivative obligations; or (2) we could be declared in default on our derivative obligations if repayment of the underlying indebtedness is accelerated by the lender due to our default on the indebtedness.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P147_S1	As of December 31, 2011, the fair value of derivatives related to these agreements is a net liability position of $40.9 million, which includes accrued interest but excludes any adjustment for nonperformance risk.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P147_S2	As of December 31, 2011, we have not posted any collateral related to these agreements.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P147_S3	Had we breached any of the provisions discussed above at December 31, 2011, we may have been required to settle our obligations under the agreements at their termination value of $44.5 million.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P148_S0	From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap and cap agreements in order to limit our interest expense related to our notes payable on real estate.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P148_S1	If any of these agreements are not designated as effective hedges, then they are marked to market each period with the change in fair value recognized in current period earnings.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P149_S0	The net impact on our earnings resulting from gains and/or losses on interest rate swap and cap agreements associated with notes payable on real estate has not been significant.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P149_S1	We routinely monitor our exposure to currency exchange rate changes in connection with transactions and sometimes enter into foreign currency exchange swap, option and forward contracts to limit our exposure to such transactions, as appropriate.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P149_S2	In the normal course of business, we also sometimes utilize derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange exposure resulting from inter-company loans, expected cash flow and earnings.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P150_S0	Included in the consolidated statements of operations were net losses of $1.5 million, $1.0 million and $3.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, resulting from net losses on foreign currency exchange swap, option and forward contracts.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P150_S1	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we did not have any foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P150_S2	We also enter into loan commitments that relate to the origination or acquisition of commercial mortgage loans that will be held for resale.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P150_S3	Topic 815 requires that these commitments be recorded at their fair values as derivatives.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P150_S4	The net impact on our financial position and earnings resulting from these derivatives contracts has not been significant.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P151_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment consists of the following (dollars in thousands): Depreciation and amortization expense associated with property and equipment was $54.2 million, $58.7 million and $59.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P152_S0	The following table summarizes the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 (dollars in thousands): During 2011, in addition to the REIM Acquisitions, we completed five in-fill acquisitions, including a valuation business in Australia, a retail property management business in central and eastern Europe, our former affiliate company in Switzerland, a retail services business in the U.K. and a shopping center management business in the Netherlands.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P152_S1	Because of the economic downturn, no acquisitions were completed in 2009 and 2010, except for a small niche industrial practice in the United Kingdom (U.K.) acquired in the second quarter of 2010 and a small commercial property asset management and consultancy services firm in Hong Kong in the fourth quarter of 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P153_S0	Our annual assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives has historically been completed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P153_S1	We performed the 2011, 2010 and 2009 annual assessments as of October 1.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P153_S2	When we performed our required annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we determined that no impairment existed as the estimated fair value of our reporting units was in excess of their carrying value.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P153_S3	Although economic conditions remained weak for most of 2009 and our full year revenues for 2009 declined when compared to 2008, we did note early signs of an economic recovery taking place in the latter part of 2009, which continued throughout 2010 and 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P154_S0	Pacific region with transaction activity beginning to revive in late 2009.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P154_S1	These indicators, as well as the benefit of cost reduction measures implemented in the second half of 2008 and in 2009, led to a significant increase in the estimated fair value of the Company s reporting units as of October 1, 2011, 2010 and 2009 as compared to the estimated fair value at December 31, 2008.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P154_S2	In addition, the overall size of our goodwill being tested was sharply reduced as a result of the $1.1 billion impairment charge recorded during the year ended December 31, 2008.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P154_S3	This impairment charge included the write-off of goodwill in its entirety in two reporting units that were most severely impacted by the weak economic conditions at that time (i.e. Global Investment Management and Development Services).
1138118_12_ITEM8_P155_S0	If we experience a significant or sustained decline in our future cash flows and/or current economic conditions, we may need to perform additional impairment analysis in the future.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P156_S0	Other intangible assets totaled $794.3 million and $332.9 million, net of accumulated amortization of $195.0 million and $166.3 million, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are comprised of the following (dollars in thousands): Management contracts with indefinite useful lives primarily represent intangible assets identified as a result of the REIM Acquisitions relating to relationships with open-end funds.

1138118_12_ITEM8_P156_S2	In connection with the REIM Acquisitions, a trade name of $20.4 million was separately identified, which represented the Clarion Partners trade name in the U.S. As a result of the Insignia Acquisition, a $19.8 million trade name was separately identified, which represented the Richard Ellis trade name in the U.K. These intangible assets have indefinite useful lives and accordingly are not being amortized.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P157_S0	Customer relationships primarily represent intangible assets identified in the Trammell Crow Company Acquisition relating to existing relationships primarily in the brokerage, property management, project management and facilities management lines of business.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P157_S1	These intangible assets are being amortized over useful lives of up to 20 years.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P158_S0	Management contracts consist primarily of asset management contracts relating to relationships with closed-end funds and separate accounts in the U.S., Europe and Asia that were separately identified as a result of the REIM Acquisitions.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P158_S1	Also included in management contracts are property management contracts in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and France, as well as valuation services and fund management contracts in the U.K.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P158_S2	These management contracts are being amortized over useful lives of up to 13 years.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P159_S0	Loan servicing rights represent the fair value of servicing assets in our mortgage brokerage line of business in the U.S.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P159_S1	The loan servicing rights are being amortized over the useful lives of the underlying loans, which are generally up to ten years.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P160_S0	Backlog and incentive fees mostly represented the fair value of net revenue backlog and incentive fees acquired as part of the Trammell Crow Company Acquisition as well as other in-fill acquisitions.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P160_S1	These intangible assets were amortized over useful lives of up to one year.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P160_S2	Other amortizable intangible assets mainly represent transition costs, non-compete agreements acquired as a result of the REIM Acquisitions and other intangible assets acquired as a result of the Trammell Crow Company Acquisition and the Insignia Acquisition.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P160_S3	Other intangible assets are being amortized over useful lives of up to 20 years.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P160_S4	Amortization expense related to intangible assets was $41.9 million, $23.1 million and $19.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P160_S5	The estimated annual amortization expense for each of the years ending December 31, 2012 through December 31, 2016 approximates $62.2 million, $56.6 million, $49.0 million, $45.0 million and $40.7 million, respectively.

1138118_12_ITEM8_P167_S0	Real Estate We provide build-to-suit services for our clients and also develop or purchase certain projects which we intend to sell to institutional investors upon project completion or redevelopment.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P167_S1	Therefore, we have ownership of real estate until such projects are sold or otherwise disposed.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P167_S2	Additionally, effective January 1, 2010, we adopted ASU 2009-17 and began consolidating certain variable interest entities that hold investments in real estate (see Note 4).
1138118_12_ITEM8_P168_S0	Certain real estate assets secure the outstanding balances of underlying mortgage or construction loans.

1138118_12_ITEM8_P197_S0	In August 2009, CBRE Capital Markets entered into a funding arrangement with Fannie Mae under its Multifamily As Soon As Pooled Plus Agreement and its Multifamily As Soon As Pooled Sale Agreement (ASAP) Program.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P197_S1	Under the ASAP Program, CBRE Capital Markets may elect, on a transaction by transaction basis, to sell a percentage of certain closed multifamily loans to Fannie Mae on an expedited basis.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P197_S2	After all contingencies are satisfied, the ASAP Program requires that CBRE Capital Markets repurchase the interest in the multifamily loan previously sold to Fannie Mae followed by either a full delivery back to Fannie Mae via whole loan execution or a securitization into a mortgage backed security.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P197_S3	Under this agreement, the maximum outstanding balance under the ASAP Program cannot exceed $150.0 million and, between the sale date to Fannie Mae and the repurchase date by CBRE Capital Markets, the outstanding balance bears interest and is payable to Fannie Mae at the daily LIBOR rate plus 1.35% with a LIBOR floor of 0.35%.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P198_S0	On December 21, 2010, CBRE Capital Markets entered into a secured credit agreement with TD Bank to establish a warehouse line of credit.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P198_S1	Effective October 13, 2011, the warehouse line of credit was increased from $75.0 million to $100.0 million.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P198_S2	The secured revolving line of credit bears interest at the daily one-month LIBOR plus 2.0% with a maturity date of May 31, 2012.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P199_S0	On December 21, 2010, CBRE Capital Markets entered into an uncommitted funding arrangement with Kemps Landing providing CBRE Capital Markets with the ability to fund Freddie Mac multi-family loans.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P199_S1	Effective September 13, 2011, the maximum outstanding balance allowed under this arrangement was increased from $200.0 million to $300.0 million and on October 4, 2011, was further increased to $500.0 million.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P199_S2	The outstanding borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.75% with a LIBOR floor of 0.25% and the agreement expires on December 19, 2012.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P200_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2011, we had a maximum of $747.2 million of warehouse lines of credit principal outstanding.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P200_S1	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had $713.4 million and $453.8 million of warehouse lines of credit principal outstanding, respectively, which are included in short-term borrowings in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P200_S2	Non-cash activity totaling $234.6 million, $141.0 million and $102.4 million increased the warehouse lines of credit during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P200_S3	Additionally, we had $720.1 million and $485.4 million of mortgage loans held for sale (warehouse receivables), which substantially represented mortgage loans funded through the lines of credit that, while committed to be purchased, had not yet been purchased as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and which are also included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P200_S4	Non-cash activity totaling $234.6 million, $141.0 million and $102.4 million increased the warehouse receivables during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P201_S0	Commitments and Contingencies We are a party to a number of pending or threatened lawsuits arising out of, or incident to, our ordinary course of business.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P201_S1	Our management believes that any losses in excess of the amounts accrued arising from such lawsuits are remote, but that litigation is inherently uncertain and there is the potential for a material adverse effect on our financial statements if one or more matters are resolved in a particular period in an amount in excess of that anticipated by management.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P202_S0	Our leases generally relate to office space that we occupy, have varying terms and expire through 2030.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P202_S1	The following is a schedule by year of future minimum lease payments for noncancellable operating leases as of December 31, 2011 (dollars in thousands):
1138118_12_ITEM8_P203_S0	Total minimum payments for noncancellable operating leases were not reduced by the minimum sublease rental income of $9.2 million due in the future under noncancellable subleases.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P204_S0	Substantially all leases require us to pay maintenance costs, insurance and property taxes.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P204_S1	The composition of total rental expense under noncancellable operating leases consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_12_ITEM8_P204_S2	We had outstanding letters of credit totaling $16.6 million as of December 31, 2011, excluding letters of credit for which we have outstanding liabilities already accrued on our consolidated balance sheet related to our subsidiaries outstanding reserves for claims under certain insurance programs as well as letters of credit related to operating leases.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P204_S3	These letters of credit are primarily executed by us in the ordinary course of business and expire at varying dates through December 2012.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P204_S4	We had guarantees totaling $43.7 million as of December 31, 2011, excluding guarantees related to pension liabilities, consolidated indebtedness and other obligations for which we have outstanding liabilities already accrued on our consolidated balance sheet, and operating leases.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P204_S5	The $43.7 million primarily consists of guarantees related to our defined benefit pension plans in the U.K. (in excess of our outstanding pension liability of $60.9 million as of December 31, 2011), which are continuous guarantees that will not expire until all amounts have been paid out for our pension liabilities.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P204_S6	The remainder of the guarantees mainly represent guarantees of obligations of unconsolidated subsidiaries, which expire at varying dates through November 2013, as well as various guarantees of management contracts in our operations overseas, which expire at the end of each of the respective agreements.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P205_S0	In addition, as of December 31, 2011, we had numerous completion and budget guarantees relating to development projects.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P205_S1	These guarantees are made by us in the ordinary course of our Development Services business.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P205_S2	Each of these guarantees requires us to complete construction of the relevant project within a specified timeframe and/or within a specified budget, with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P205_S3	However, we generally have guaranteed maximum price contracts with reputable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P205_S4	These contracts are intended to pass the risk to such contractors.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P205_S5	While there can be no assurance, we do not expect to incur any material losses under these guarantees.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P206_S0	From time to time, we act as a general contractor with respect to construction projects.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P206_S1	We do not consider these activities to be a material part of our business.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P206_S2	In connection with these activities, we seek to subcontract construction work for certain projects to reputable subcontractors.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P206_S3	Should construction defects arise relating to the underlying projects, we could potentially be liable to the client for the costs to repair such defects, although we would generally look to the subcontractor that performed the work to remedy the defect and also look to insurance policies that cover this work.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P206_S4	While there can be no assurance, we do not expect to incur material losses with respect to construction defects.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P207_S0	In January 2008, CBRE Multifamily Capital, Inc. (CBRE MCI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBRE Capital Markets, Inc., entered into an agreement with Fannie Mae, under Fannie Mae s DUS Lender Program (DUS Program), to provide financing for multifamily housing with five or more units.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P207_S1	Under the DUS Program, CBRE MCI originates, underwrites, closes and services loans without prior approval by Fannie Mae, and in selected cases, is subject to sharing up to one-third of any losses on loans originated under the DUS Program.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P207_S2	CBRE MCI has funded loans subject to such loss sharing arrangements with unpaid principal balances of $3.5 billion at December 31, 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P207_S3	Additionally, CBRE MCI has funded loans under the DUS Program that are not subject to loss sharing arrangements with unpaid principal balances of approximately $518.1 million at December 31, 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P208_S0	CBRE MCI, under its agreement with Fannie Mae, must post cash reserves under formulas established by Fannie Mae to provide for sufficient capital in the event losses occur.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P208_S1	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, CBRE MCI had $4.6 million and $2.2 million, respectively, of cash deposited under this reserve arrangement, and had provided approximately $6.4 million and $4.0 million, respectively, of loan loss accruals.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P208_S2	Fannie Mae s recourse under the DUS Program is limited to the assets of CBRE MCI, which totaled approximately $180.6 million (including $106.6 million of warehouse receivables, a substantial majority of which are pledged against warehouse lines of credit and are therefore not available to Fannie Mae) at December 31, 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P209_S0	An important part of the strategy for our Global Investment Management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P209_S1	These co-investments typically range from 2.0% to 5.0% of the equity in a particular fund.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P209_S2	As of December 31, 2011, we had aggregate commitments of $59.4 million to fund future co-investments.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P209_S3	Additionally, an important part of our Development Services business strategy is to invest in unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries as a principal (in most cases co-investing with our clients).
1138118_12_ITEM8_P209_S4	As of December 31, 2011, we had committed to fund $14.4 million of additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P210_S0	Employee Benefit Plans Stock Incentive Plans 2001 Stock Incentive Plan.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P210_S1	Our 2001 stock incentive plan was adopted by our board of directors and approved by our stockholders on June 7, 2001.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P210_S2	However, our 2001 stock incentive plan was terminated in June 2004 in connection with the adoption of our 2004 stock incentive plan, which is described below.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P210_S3	The 2001 stock incentive plan permitted the grant of nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards to our employees, directors or independent contractors.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P210_S4	Since our 2001 stock incentive plan has been terminated, no shares remain available for issuance under it.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P210_S5	However, as of December 31, 2011, outstanding stock options granted under the 2001 stock incentive plan to acquire 2,001,146 shares of our Class A common stock remain outstanding according to their terms, and we will continue to issue shares to the extent required under the terms of such outstanding awards.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P210_S6	Options granted under this plan have an exercise price of $1.92.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P210_S7	As of December 31, 2009, all options granted under this plan were fully vested and exercisable.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P211_S0	Options granted under the 2001 stock incentive plan are subject to a maximum term of ten years from the date of grant.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P212_S0	The number of shares issued pursuant to the 2001 stock incentive plan, or pursuant to outstanding awards, is subject to adjustment on account of stock splits, stock dividends and other dilutive changes in our Class A common stock.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P213_S0	Second Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P213_S1	Our 2004 stock incentive plan was adopted by our board of directors and approved by our stockholders on April 21, 2004, and has been amended several times subsequently, including an amendment and restatement on June 2, 2008 and an amendment on December 3, 2008.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P213_S2	The 2004 stock incentive plan authorizes the grant of stock-based awards to our employees, directors or independent contractors.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P213_S3	A total of 20,785,218 shares of our Class A common stock initially were reserved for issuance under the 2004 stock incentive plan, which increased by 10,000,000 shares to a total of 30,785,218 shares in connection with the June 2, 2008 amendment and restatement.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P213_S4	For awards granted prior to June 2, 2008 under this plan, this share reserve was reduced by one share upon grant of an option or stock appreciation right, and was reduced by 2.25 shares upon issuance of stock pursuant to other stock-based awards.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P213_S5	For awards granted on or after June 2, 2008 under this plan, this share reserve is reduced by one share upon grant of all awards.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P213_S6	In addition, full value awards, i.e., awards other than stock options and stock appreciation rights, are limited to no more than 75% of the total share reserve.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P213_S7	Awards that expire, terminate or lapse will again be available for grant under this plan.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P213_S8	No person is eligible to be granted awards in the aggregate covering more than 2,000,000 shares during any fiscal year.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P214_S0	The number of shares issued or reserved pursuant to the 2004 stock incentive plan, or pursuant to outstanding awards, is subject to adjustment on account of mergers, consolidations, reorganizations, stock splits, stock dividends and other dilutive changes in our common stock.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P214_S1	In addition, our board of directors may adjust outstanding awards to preserve the awards benefits or potential benefits.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P215_S0	Stock Option Exchange On July 9, 2009, we completed a stock option exchange program (Exchange Offer) under which eligible employees tendered, and we accepted for cancellation, eligible options to purchase 2,599,307 shares of our Class A common stock.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P215_S1	We granted new options to eligible employees to purchase 103,361 shares of our Class A common stock and issued 819,672 restricted shares of our Class A common stock in exchange for the cancellation of the tendered eligible options.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P215_S2	The exercise price per share of the new options granted in the Exchange Offer was $8.09, the closing price of our common stock on July 9, 2009.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P215_S3	The new options and restricted shares issued will vest and are exercisable in equal annual increments over four years from the date of grant.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P215_S4	This Exchange Offer did not result in any incremental compensation expense as the estimated fair value of the new awards did not exceed the estimated fair value of the exchanged stock options immediately prior to the exchange.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P216_S0	Stock Options As of December 31, 2011, 2,791,263 shares were subject to options issued under our 2004 stock incentive plan and 2,087,598 shares remained available for future grants under the 2004 stock incentive plan.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P216_S1	Options granted under this plan during the year ended December 31, 2011 have an exercise price of $26.50 and options granted during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 have exercise prices in the ranges of $14.88 to $16.48 and $8.09 to $11.45, respectively, which primarily vest and are exercisable generally in equal annual increments over four years from the date of grant.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P216_S2	All options that have been granted under the 2004 stock incentive plan have a term of five or seven years from the date of grant.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P216_S3	A summary of the status of our outstanding stock options is presented in the tables below:
1138118_12_ITEM8_P217_S0	(3) The expected to vest options are the result of applying the pre-vesting forfeiture rate assumption to total outstanding options.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P218_S0	We estimate the fair value of our options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which takes into account assumptions such as the dividend yield, the risk-free interest rate, the expected stock price volatility and the expected life of the options.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P219_S0	The total estimated grant date fair value of stock options that vested during the year ended December 31, 2011 was $3.4 million.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P219_S1	The weighted average fair value of options granted by us was $13.49, $10.40 and $6.63 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P220_S0	The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, utilizing the following weighted average assumptions: The dividend yield assumption is excluded from the calculation, as it is our present intention to retain all earnings.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P220_S1	The expected volatility is based on a combination of our historical stock price and implied volatility.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P220_S2	The selection of implied volatility data to estimate expected volatility is based upon the availability of actively traded options on our stock.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P220_S3	The risk-free interest rate is based upon the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the options.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P220_S4	The expected life of our stock options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is based on historical experience of similar options, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P221_S0	Option valuation models require the input of subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility and expected life.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P221_S1	Because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, we do not believe that the Black-Scholes model necessarily provides a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P222_S0	Options outstanding at December 31, 2011 and their related weighted average exercise price, intrinsic value and life information is presented below: At December 31, 2011, the aggregate intrinsic value and weighted average remaining contractual life for options vested and expected to vest were $31.4 million and 2.4 years, respectively.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P222_S1	Total compensation expense related to stock options was $3.5 million, $3.7 million and $7.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P222_S2	At December 31, 2011, total unrecognized estimated compensation cost related to non-vested stock options was approximately $3.1 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.1 years.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P223_S0	The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $39.9 million, $14.5 million and $11.4 million, respectively.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P223_S1	We recorded cash received from stock option exercises of $7.1 million, $2.4 million and $15.4 million and related tax benefit of $14.9 million, $5.4 million and $1.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P224_S0	Upon option exercise, we issue new shares of stock.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P225_S0	Excess tax benefits exist when the tax deduction resulting from the exercise of options exceeds the compensation cost recorded.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P226_S0	Non-Vested Stock Awards We have issued non-vested stock awards, including shares and stock units, in our Class A common stock to certain of our employees and members of our board of directors.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P226_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we granted non-vested stock awards of 2,803,221 shares, 1,196,720 shares and 6,711,288 shares, respectively, which primarily vest and are exercisable generally in equal annual increments over four years from the date of grant.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P226_S2	We also granted 644,635, 759,992 and 54,344 of non-vested stock units to certain of our employees during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P226_S3	These non-vested stock units primarily vest in 2015 and 2016.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P226_S4	A summary of the status of our non-vested stock awards is presented in the table below:
1138118_12_ITEM8_P227_S0	Total compensation expense related to non-vested stock awards was $40.8 million, $43.1 million and $30.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P227_S1	At December 31, 2011, total unrecognized estimated compensation cost related to non-vested stock awards was approximately $116.4 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 3.0 years.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P228_S0	We have bonus programs covering select employees, including senior management.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P228_S1	Awards are based on the position and performance of the employee and the achievement of pre-established financial, operating and strategic objectives.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P228_S2	The amounts charged to expense for bonuses were $154.4 million, $135.0 million and $60.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P229_S0	Our CBRE 401(k) Plan (401(k) Plan) is a defined contribution savings plan that allows participant deferrals under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P230_S0	other than qualified real estate agents having the status of independent contractors under section 3508 of the Internal Revenue Code, are eligible to participate in the plan.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P230_S1	The 401(k) Plan provides for participant contributions as well as a Company match.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P230_S2	A participant is allowed to contribute to the 401(k) Plan from 1% to 75% of his or her compensation, subject to limits imposed by applicable law.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P230_S3	Effective January 1, 2007, all participants hired post January 1, 2007 vest in company match contributions 20% per year for each plan year they work 1,000 hours.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P230_S4	All participants hired before January 1, 2007 are immediately vested in company match contributions.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P230_S5	The Company match was suspended in 2009 and 2010 due to adverse economic conditions.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P230_S6	However, we made a partial retroactive match for 2010 401(k) participants who were employed at December 31, 2010, which is included in the $2.7 million expense for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P230_S7	As of January 1, 2011, the Company match was reinstated.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P230_S8	For 2011, we contributed a 50% match on the first 3% of annual compensation (up to $150,000 of compensation) deferred by each participant.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P230_S9	In connection with the 401(k) Plan, we charged to expense $10.9 million, $2.7 million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P231_S0	Participants are entitled to invest up to 25% of their 401(k) account balance in shares of our common stock.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P231_S1	As of December 31, 2011, approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock were held as investments by participants in our 401(k) Plan.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P232_S0	We have two contributory defined benefit pension plans in the U.K.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P232_S1	The London-based firm of Hillier Parker May Rowden, which we acquired in 1998, had a contributory defined benefit pension plan.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P232_S2	A subsidiary of Insignia, which we acquired in connection with the Insignia Acquisition in 2003, also had a contributory defined benefit pension plan in the U.K.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P232_S3	Our subsidiaries based in the U.K. maintain the plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in these plans.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P232_S4	With respect to these plans, our historical policy has been to contribute annually an amount to fund pension cost as actuarially determined and as required by applicable laws and regulations.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P232_S5	Effective July 1, 2007, we reached agreements with the active members of these plans to freeze future pension plan benefits.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P232_S6	In return, the active members became eligible to enroll in a defined contribution plan.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P233_S0	The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the benefit obligation, plan assets, plan s funded status and amounts recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets for both of our defined benefit pension plans (dollars in thousands):
1138118_12_ITEM8_P233_S1	The accumulated benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans was $316.2 million and $296.6 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P233_S2	Items not yet recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost were as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_12_ITEM8_P234_S0	The estimated net actuarial loss that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic pension cost in 2012 is $2.3 million.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P235_S0	Components of net periodic pension cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive loss (income) consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_12_ITEM8_P236_S0	Weighted average assumptions used to determine our projected benefit obligation were as follows:
1138118_12_ITEM8_P236_S1	Weighted average assumptions used to determine our net periodic pension cost were as follows: We select a discount rate by reference to yields available at our balance sheet date on U.K. AA-rated corporate bonds.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P237_S0	The corporate bond yield curve is derived by taking a government bond yield curve, based on Bank of England data and adding an amount to reflect the yield spread on AA-rated bonds over government bonds.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P237_S1	This discount rate selected is the weighted average of the yields on the resulting bond yield curve, where the weighting is based on the expected cash flow from the weighted average duration of the pension plans.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P238_S0	We review historical rates of return for equity and fixed income securities, as well as current economic conditions, to determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P238_S1	The assumed rate of return for 2011 is based on 60.2% of the portfolio being invested in equities yielding a 6.9% return and 26.9% of assets being primarily invested in corporate and government debt securities yielding a 4.3% return.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P238_S2	Consideration is given to diversification and periodic rebalancing of the portfolio based on prevailing market conditions.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P239_S0	Our pension plan weighted average asset allocations by asset category were as follows:
1138118_12_ITEM8_P240_S0	Our pension trust assets are invested with a long-term focus to achieve a return on investment that is based on levels of liquidity and investment risk that the trustees, in consultation with management believe are prudent and reasonable.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P240_S1	The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income and index linked investments consisting primarily of government debt.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P240_S2	The equity investments are diversified across U.K. and non-U.K. equities, as well as value, growth, and medium and large capitalizations.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P240_S3	The portfolio s asset mix is reviewed regularly, and the portfolio is rebalanced based on existing market conditions.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P240_S4	Investment risk is measured and monitored on a regular basis through quarterly portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements and periodic asset/liability analyses.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P240_S5	The fair value of our pension assets are comprised of the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_12_ITEM8_P241_S0	(a) The assets in this category represent investments in foreign equity and bond funds.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P241_S1	Generally, these assets are valued using bid-market valuations provided by the funds investment managers.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P242_S0	(b) The assets in this category include investments in a liability driven investment fund and investments in commercial real estate.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P242_S1	The liability driven investment fund is a single priced fund and the fair value of the underlying assets are priced by the fund s custodian based on observable market data and therefore categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P243_S0	The fair values for these investments are based on inputs obtained from broker quotes that are indicative of value and cannot be corroborated by observable market data and therefore are categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P244_S0	A summary of our pension assets measured and recorded using significant unobservable inputs is as follows (dollars in thousands): We expect to contribute $5.2 million to our pension plans in 2012.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P244_S1	The following is a schedule by year of benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, that are expected to be paid (dollars in thousands):
1138118_12_ITEM8_P245_S0	We also have defined contribution plans for employees in the U.K.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P245_S1	Our contributions to these plans were approximately $8.7 million, $7.3 million and $8.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P246_S0	The components of income (loss) from continuing operations before provision for income taxes consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_12_ITEM8_P247_S0	Our tax provision (benefit) consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_12_ITEM8_P248_S0	The following is a reconciliation stated as a percentage of pre-tax income (loss) of the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate:
1138118_12_ITEM8_P248_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, we recorded a $15.5 million, $5.6 million and $3.5 million income tax benefit in connection with stock options exercised.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P248_S2	Of this income tax benefit, $14.9 million, $5.4 million and $1.6 million was charged directly to additional paid-in capital within the equity section of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P249_S0	Cumulative tax effects of temporary differences are shown below at December 31, 2011 and 2010 (dollars in thousands):
1138118_12_ITEM8_P250_S0	As of December 31, 2011, we had U.S. federal net operating losses (NOLs) of approximately $10.1 million, translating to a deferred tax asset before valuation allowance of $3.5 million, which will begin to expire in 2023.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P250_S1	As of December 31, 2011, there were also deferred tax assets of approximately $14.3 million related to state NOLs as well as $32.8 million related to foreign NOLs.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P250_S2	The state and foreign NOLs both begin to expire in 2012.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P251_S0	The utilization of NOLs may be subject to certain limitations under U.S. federal, state and foreign laws.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P251_S1	Management determined that as of December 31, 2011, $37.6 million of deferred tax assets do not satisfy the recognition criteria set forth in Topic 740.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P251_S2	Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been recorded for this amount.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P251_S3	If released, the entire amount would result in a benefit to continuing operations.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P251_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2011, our valuation allowances decreased by approximately $3.5 million.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P251_S5	This was primarily the result of decreases of $10.1 million related to the reversal of state valuation allowances on net operating losses and other state assets, $2.5 million related to the utilization of foreign net operating losses and $1.9 million related to foreign net operating loss adjustments.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P251_S6	These decreases were partially offset by the establishment of valuation allowances of $8.4 million related to foreign net operating losses and other foreign assets and $2.6 million related to federal net operating losses and other federal assets.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P251_S7	Management believes it is more likely than not that future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets recorded net of these valuation allowances.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P251_S8	Presently, we have not recorded a deferred tax liability for undistributed earnings of subsidiaries located outside of the U.S.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P251_S9	These earnings may become taxable upon a payment of a dividend or as a result of a sale or liquidation of the subsidiaries.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P251_S10	At this time, we do not have any plans to repatriate income from our foreign subsidiaries, however, to the extent that we are able to repatriate such earnings in a tax free manner, or in the event of a change in our capital situation or investment strategy, it is possible that the foreign subsidiaries may pay a dividend which would impact our effective tax rate.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P251_S11	In addition, if such funds became needed for funding our U.S. operations, then we may be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P251_S12	Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which have been, or are intended to be permanently invested, aggregated approximately $1.1 billion at December 31, 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P251_S13	Cash and cash equivalents owned by non-U.S. subsidiaries totaled $210.3 million at December 31, 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P252_S0	The determination of the tax liability upon repatriation is not practicable.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P253_S0	The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $91.7 million and $77.2 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P253_S1	The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect our effective tax rate, if recognized, is $43.0 million ($41.8 million, net of federal benefit received from state positions) and $39.1 million ($37.9 million, net of federal benefit received from state positions) as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P253_S2	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 is as follows (dollars in thousands): We currently anticipate a decrease of $12.4 million to unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months due to the anticipated settlement of ongoing audits.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P253_S3	Our continuing practice is to recognize potential accrued interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters within income tax expense.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P253_S4	During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we accrued an additional $3.4 million, $2.9 million and $2.8 million, respectively, in interest associated with uncertain tax positions.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P253_S5	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we have recognized a liability for interest and penalties of $27.1 million ($21.8 million, net of related federal benefit received from interest expense) and $23.7 million ($19.5 million, net of related federal benefit received from interest expense), respectively.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P254_S0	We conduct business globally and, as a result, one or more of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and multiple state, local and foreign jurisdictions.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P254_S1	We are no longer subject to U.S. federal Internal Revenue Service audits for years prior to 2005.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P254_S2	With limited exception, our significant state and foreign tax jurisdictions are no longer subject to audit by the various tax authorities for tax years prior to 2005.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P255_S0	On June 4, 2009, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation that increased the total number of shares of Class A common stock that we are authorized to issue from 325,000,000 to 525,000,000, with $0.01 par value per share.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P255_S1	Holders of our Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters on which our stockholders are entitled to vote.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P255_S2	Holders of our Class A common stock are entitled to receive ratable dividends if and when declared from time to time by our board of directors out of funds legally available for that purpose, after payment of dividends required to be paid on any outstanding preferred stock.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P255_S3	Our Credit Agreement governing our revolving credit facility and senior secured term loan facilities imposes restrictions on our ability to declare dividends with respect to our Class A common stock.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P255_S4	Our board of directors is authorized, subject to any limitations imposed by law, without the approval of our stockholders, to issue a total of 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, in one or more series, with each such series having rights and preferences including voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences, as our board of directors may determine.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P256_S0	On June 10, 2009, we completed the sale of 13,440,860 shares of our Class A common stock through a direct placement to Paulson Co. Inc., which raised approximately $97.6 million of net proceeds.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P256_S1	On June 11, 2009, we completed the sale of 5,682,684 shares of our Class A common stock through an at-the-market offering program, which raised approximately $48.8 million of net proceeds.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P256_S2	In November 2009, we completed the sale of 28,289,960 shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to an at-the-market offering program, which raised approximately $293.8 million of net proceeds.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P257_S0	The following is a calculation of earnings per share (dollars in thousands, except share data):
1138118_12_ITEM8_P257_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, options to purchase 55,587, 115,775 and 3,037,573 shares, respectively, of common stock and 11,880, 112,865 and 1,919,083, respectively, of contingently issuable shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P257_S2	The accompanying consolidated balance sheets do not include the net assets of escrow, agency and fiduciary funds, which are held by us on behalf of clients and which amounted to $1.8 billion and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P258_S0	Discontinued Operations In the ordinary course of business, we dispose of real estate assets, or hold real estate assets for sale, that may be considered components of an entity in accordance with Topic 360.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P258_S1	If we do not have, or expect to have, significant continuing involvement with the operation of these real estate assets after disposition, we are required to recognize operating profits or losses and gains or losses on disposition of these assets as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations in the periods in which they occur.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P258_S2	We did not report any discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P258_S3	Real estate operations and dispositions accounted for as discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were reported in our Global Investment Management and Development Services segments and totaled the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_12_ITEM8_P259_S0	Segments We report our operations through the following segments: (1) Americas, (2) EMEA, (3) Asia Pacific, (4) Global Investment Management and (5) Development Services.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P260_S0	The Americas segment is our largest segment of operations and provides a comprehensive range of services throughout the U.S. and in the largest regions of Canada and key markets in Latin America.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P260_S1	The primary services offered consist of the following: real estate services, mortgage loan origination and servicing, valuation services, asset services and corporate services.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P260_S2	Our EMEA and Asia Pacific segments provide services similar to the Americas business segment.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P260_S3	The EMEA segment has operations primarily in Europe, while the Asia Pacific segment has operations primarily in Asia, Australia and New Zealand.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P261_S0	Our Global Investment Management business provides investment management services to clients seeking to generate returns and diversification through direct and indirect investments in real estate in North America, Europe and Asia.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P261_S1	Our Development Services business consists of real estate development and investment activities primarily in the U.S.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P262_S0	Summarized financial information by segment is as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_12_ITEM8_P263_S0	EBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P263_S1	Our management believes EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P263_S2	Such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P263_S3	As a result, our management uses EBITDA as a measure to evaluate the operating performance of our various business segments and for other discretionary purposes, including as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive programs.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P263_S4	Additionally, we believe EBITDA is useful to investors to assist them in getting a more complete picture of our results from operations.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P263_S5	However, EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under GAAP and when analyzing our operating performance, readers should use EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P263_S6	Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P263_S7	Furthermore, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management s discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P263_S8	The amounts shown for EBITDA also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P264_S0	Net interest expense and write-off of financing costs have been expensed in the segment incurred.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P264_S1	Provision for (benefit of) income taxes has been allocated among our segments by using applicable U.S. and foreign effective tax rates.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P264_S2	EBITDA for our segments is calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_12_ITEM8_P265_S0	(1) Includes depreciation and amortization related to discontinued operations of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P266_S0	(2) Includes interest expense related to discontinued operations of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P267_S0	Identifiable assets by industry segment are those assets used in our operations in each segment.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P267_S1	Corporate identifiable assets include cash and cash equivalents available for general corporate use and net deferred tax assets.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P268_S0	The revenue shown in the table above is allocated based upon the country in which services are performed.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P268_S1	The long-lived assets shown in the table above are comprised of net property and equipment.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P268_S2	Related Party Transactions Included in prepaid expenses, other current assets and other long-term assets, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are loans to related parties, primarily employees, of $52.3 million and $48.6 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P268_S3	The majority of these loans represent sign-on and retention bonuses issued or assumed in connection with acquisitions and prepaid commissions as well as prepaid retention and recruitment awards issued to employees.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P268_S4	These loans are at varying principal amounts, bear interest at rates up to 5.1% per annum and mature on various dates through 2019.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P269_S0	Bob Sulentic, an executive officer, committed to invest a minimum of $0.8 million in Trammell Crow Company Acquisitions I, L.P. and Trammell Crow Company Acquisitions II, L.P. (through pooled co-investment vehicles organized for the investment of certain employees).
1138118_12_ITEM8_P269_S1	As of December 31, 2011, Mr. Sulentic had funded the full amount of his commitment in these investments.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P269_S2	These funds are closed-end real estate investment funds managed and sponsored by our subsidiary, Trammell Crow Company.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P269_S3	These investments have been approved by our board of directors, including all of the disinterested members.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P270_S0	(2) Elimination entries necessary to consolidate CBRE Group, Inc. as the parent, with CBRE and its guarantor and nonguarantor subsidiaries.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P271_S0	Investments in consolidated subsidiaries are presented using the equity method of accounting.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P271_S1	The principal elimination entries eliminate investments in consolidated subsidiaries and intercompany balances and transactions.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P272_S0	Although CBRE Capital Markets is included among our domestic subsidiaries, which jointly and severally guarantee our 11.625% senior subordinated notes, our 6.625% senior notes and our Credit Agreement, a substantial majority of warehouse receivables funded under the Kemps Landing, JP Morgan, TD Bank, Fannie Mae ASAP Program and BofA lines of credit are pledged to Kemps Landing, JP Morgan, TD Bank, Fannie Mae and BofA, and accordingly, are not included as collateral for these notes or our other outstanding debt.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P273_S0	Although CBRE Capital Markets is included among our domestic subsidiaries, which jointly and severally guarantee our 11.625% senior subordinated notes, our 6.625% senior notes and our Credit Agreement, a substantial majority of warehouse receivables funded under the Kemps Landing, JP Morgan, BofA and Fannie Mae ASAP lines of credit are pledged to Kemps Landing, JP Morgan, BofA and Fannie Mae, and accordingly, are not included as collateral for these notes or our other outstanding debt.
1138118_12_ITEM8_P274_S0	(1) EPS is defined as earnings (loss) per share.
1138118_12_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Securities Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f), including maintenance of (i) records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets, and (ii) policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance that (a) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, (b) our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our Board of Directors and (c) we will prevent or timely detect unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1138118_12_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control.
1138118_12_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses of judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.
1138118_12_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper overriding of controls.
1138118_12_ITEM9A_P1_S3	As a result of such limitations, there is risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
1138118_12_ITEM9A_P1_S4	However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
1138118_12_ITEM9A_P1_S5	Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
1138118_12_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission.

1138118_12_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Based on our evaluation under the COSO framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2011.
1138118_12_ITEM9A_P2_S3	The effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

1138118_12_ITEM9A_P3_S2	As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures.

1138118_12_ITEM13_P76_S0	The foregoing certification is being furnished solely pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 1350 and is not being filed as part of the Report or as a separate disclosure document.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P0_S0	CBRE Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, (which may be referred to in this Form 10-K as the company , we , us and our ) is the world s largest commercial real estate services and investment firm, based on 2012 revenue, with leading full-service operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P0_S1	We offer a full range of services to occupiers, owners, lenders and investors in office, retail, industrial, multifamily and other types of commercial real estate.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P0_S2	As of December 31, 2012, excluding independent affiliates, we operated in more than 300 offices worldwide, with approximately 37,000 employees providing commercial real estate services under the CBRE brand name, investment management services under the CBRE Global Investors brand name and development services under the Trammell Crow brand name.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P0_S3	Our business is focused on several competencies, including commercial property and corporate facilities management, occupier and property/agency leasing, property sales, real estate investment management, valuation, commercial mortgage origination and servicing, capital markets (equity and debt) solutions, development services and proprietary research.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P0_S4	We generate revenues from management fees on a contractual and per-project basis, and from commissions on transactions.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P0_S5	Our contractual, fee-for-services businesses, which generally involve facilities management, property management, mortgage loan servicing and investment management, represented approximately 41% of our 2012 revenue.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P0_S6	We generated revenue from a well-balanced, highly diversified base of clients.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P0_S7	In 2012, our client roster included approximately 80 of the Fortune 100 companies, and consisted of firms in a broad range of industries as follows:
1138118_13_ITEM1_P1_S0	Property owners, occupiers and investors continue to consolidate their needs with fewer service providers, and are awarding their business to firms that have strong capabilities across major markets and service disciplines.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P1_S1	We believe we are well positioned to capture a growing and disproportionate share of the business being awarded as a result of these trends.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P1_S2	In 2012, for the second year in a row, we were the highest ranked commercial real estate services company among the Fortune Most Admired Companies, and were also named the Global Real Estate Advisor of the Year by Euromoney .
1138118_13_ITEM1_P1_S3	We have been the only commercial real estate services company included in the S P 500 since 2006, and in the Fortune 500 since 2008.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P1_S4	Additionally, the International Association of Outsourcing Professionals has included us among the top 100 global outsourcing companies across all industries for six consecutive years, including in 2012 when we ranked fourth overall and were the highest ranked commercial real estate services company.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	CBRE History CBRE marked its 106 th year of continuous operations in 2012, tracing our origins to a company founded in San Francisco in the aftermath of the 1906 earthquake.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P2_S1	Since then, we have grown into the largest global commercial real estate services firm (in terms of 2012 revenue) through organic growth and a series of strategic acquisitions, including the December 2006 purchase of Trammell Crow Company, which significantly deepened our outsourcing service offerings, and the 2011 acquisition of the majority of the real estate investment management business of Netherlands-based ING Group N.V. (ING), which bolstered our global real estate investment management business and further diversified our service offerings.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P2_S2	The ING acquisitions included substantially all of ING s Real Estate Investment Management (REIM) operations in Europe and Asia, as well as substantially all of Clarion Real Estate Securities (CRES), its U.S.-based global real estate listed securities business (collectively referred to as ING REIM) along with certain CRES co-investments from ING and additional interests in other funds managed by ING REIM Europe and ING REIM Asia.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	We have also historically enhanced and complemented our global capabilities through the acquisition of regional and specialty firms that are leaders in their areas of focus, including regional firms with which we had previous affiliate relationships.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P3_S1	These in-fill acquisitions remain an integral part of our long-term strategy.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	Our Regions of Operation and Principal Services CBRE Group, Inc. is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its indirect subsidiaries.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P4_S1	CBRE Services, Inc., our direct wholly-owned subsidiary, is also generally a holding company and is the primary obligor or issuer with respect to most of our long-term indebtedness.

1138118_13_ITEM1_P4_S3	Information regarding revenue and operating income or loss, attributable to each of our segments, is included in Segment Operations within the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section and within Note 21 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by reference.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P4_S4	Information concerning the identifiable assets of each of our business segments is also set forth in Note 21 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	The Americas The Americas is our largest reporting segment, comprised of operations throughout the United States and Canada as well as key markets in Latin America.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P5_S1	Our operations are largely wholly-owned, but also include independent affiliates, which license the use of the CBRE and CB Richard Ellis names in their local markets in return for payments of annual royalty fees to us and an agreement to cross-refer business between us and the affiliate.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P5_S2	Most of our operations are conducted through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE, Inc.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P5_S3	Our mortgage loan origination, sales and servicing operations are conducted exclusively through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary operating under the name CBRE Capital Markets and its subsidiaries.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P5_S4	Our operations in Canada are conducted through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE Limited.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P5_S5	Both CBRE Capital Markets and CBRE Limited are subsidiaries of CBRE, Inc.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	Our Americas segment accounted for 63.0% of our 2012 revenue, 62.2% of our 2011 revenue and 62.9% of our 2010 revenue.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P6_S1	Within our Americas segment, we organize our services into the following business areas:
1138118_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	Our advisory services businesses offer occupier/tenant and investor/owner services that meet the full spectrum of marketplace needs, including (1) real estate services, (2) capital markets and (3) valuation.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P7_S1	Our advisory services business line accounted for 35.0% of our 2012 consolidated worldwide revenue, 34.5% of our 2011 consolidated worldwide revenue and 35.0% of our 2010 consolidated worldwide revenue.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P7_S2	Within advisory services, our major service lines are the following:
1138118_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	We provide strategic advice and execution to owners, investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with leasing, disposition and acquisition of property.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P8_S1	Our many years of strong local market presence have allowed us to develop significant repeat business from existing clients, including approximately 62% of our revenues from existing U.S. real estate sales and leasing clients in 2012.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P8_S2	This includes referrals from other parts of our business.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P8_S3	Our real estate services professionals are particularly adept at aligning real estate strategies with client business objectives, serving as advisors as well as transaction executors.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P8_S4	We believe we are a market leader for the provision of sales and leasing real estate services in most top U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau), including Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia and Phoenix.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P8_S5	Our real estate services professionals are compensated primarily through commission-based programs, which are payable upon completion of an assignment.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P8_S6	Therefore, as compensation is our largest expense, this cost structure gives us flexibility to mitigate the negative effect on our operating margins during difficult market conditions.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	Due to the low barriers to entry and significant competition for quality employees, we strive to retain top professionals through an attractive compensation program tied to productivity.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P9_S1	We believe we invest in greater support resources than most other firms, including professional development and training, market research and information, technology, branding and marketing.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P9_S2	We also foster an entrepreneurial culture that emphasizes client service and rewards performance.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P9_S3	We further strengthen our relationships with our real estate services clients by offering proprietary research to them through CBRE Research Consulting and CBRE Econometric Advisors, or CBRE-EA, our commercial real estate market information and forecasting groups.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	We offer clients fully integrated investment sales and debt/equity financing services under the CBRE Capital Markets brand.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P10_S1	The tight integration of these services fosters collaboration between our investment sales and debt/equity financing professionals, helping to meet the marketplace demand for comprehensive capital markets solutions.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P10_S2	During 2012, we concluded more than $72.1 billion of capital markets transactions in the Americas, including $50.1 billion of investment sales transactions and $22.0 billion of mortgage loan originations and sales.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P10_S3	We believe our Investment Properties business, which includes office, industrial, retail, multifamily and hotel properties, is the leading investment sales property advisor in the United States, with a market share of approximately 16% in 2012.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	Our mortgage brokerage business originates, sells and services commercial mortgage loans primarily through relationships established with investment banking firms, national banks, credit companies, insurance companies, pension funds and government agencies.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P11_S1	In the United States, our mortgage loan origination volume in 2012 was $19.2 billion, representing an increase of approximately 16% from 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P11_S2	Approximately $8.9 billion of loans in 2012 were originated for federal government-sponsored entities, most of which were financed through revolving credit lines dedicated exclusively for this purpose.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P11_S3	We substantially mitigate the principal risk associated with loans financed through these credit lines prior to closing by either obtaining a contractual purchase commitment from the government-sponsored entity or confirming a forward-trade commitment for the issuance and purchase of a mortgage-backed security that will be secured by the loan.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P11_S4	We advised on the sale of approximately $2.0 billion of mortgages on behalf of financial institutions in 2012, compared with $2.8 billion in 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	Markets, Inc., or CBRE Capital Markets, and GE Capital Real Estate, serviced approximately $106.4 billion of mortgage loans, $66.9 billion of which related to the servicing rights of CBRE Capital Markets.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	We provide valuation services that include market value appraisals, litigation support, discounted cash flow analyses and feasibility and fairness opinions.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P13_S1	Our valuation business has developed proprietary systems for data management, analysis and valuation report preparation, which we believe provides us with an advantage over our competitors.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P13_S2	We believe that our valuation business is one of the largest in the industry.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P13_S3	During 2012, we completed over 40,000 valuation, appraisal and advisory assignments in the Americas.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	Outsourcing Services Outsourcing commercial real estate services is a long-term trend in our industry, with corporations, institutions, public sector entities, health care providers and others seeking to achieve improved efficiency, better execution and lower costs by relying on the expertise of third-party real estate specialists.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P14_S1	Our outsourcing services primarily include two major business lines that seek to capitalize on this trend: (1) corporate services and (2) asset services.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	Agreements with our corporate services clients are generally long-term arrangements and although they contain different provisions for termination, there are usually penalties for early termination.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P15_S1	Our management agreements with our asset services clients may be terminated with notice generally ranging between 30 to 90 days; however, we have developed long-term relationships with many of these clients and we work closely with them to implement their specific goals and objectives and to preserve and expand upon these relationships.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P15_S2	As of December 31, 2012, we managed approximately 1.5 billion square feet of commercial space for property owners and occupiers in the Americas, which we believe represents one of the largest portfolios in the region.

1138118_13_ITEM1_P16_S1	We enter into multi-year, multi-service outsourcing contracts with our clients, but also provide services on a one-off assignment or a short-term contract basis.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P16_S2	The long-term, contractual nature of these relationships enables us to devise and execute real estate strategies that support our clients overall business strategies.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P16_S3	Our clients include leading global corporations, health care providers and public sector entities with large, geographically-diverse real estate portfolios.

1138118_13_ITEM1_P17_S2	Revenues may also include reimbursement of payroll and related costs for personnel providing the services.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	Facilities management involves the day-to-day management of client-occupied space and includes headquarter buildings, regional offices, administrative offices and manufacturing and distribution facilities.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P18_S1	We identify best practices, implement technology solutions and leverage our resources to control clients facilities costs and enhance the workplace environment.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	Contracts for facilities management services are typically structured so we receive reimbursement of client-dedicated personnel costs and associated overhead expenses plus a monthly fee, and in some cases, annual incentives if agreed-upon performance targets are satisfied.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P19_S1	In general, portfolio and transaction services contribute revenue on a transaction basis; project management and facilities management contribute contractual, or per-project, revenue and strategic consulting contributes both transaction and contractual revenue.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	We provide property management, construction management, marketing, leasing, accounting and financial services on a contractual basis for income-producing office, industrial and retail properties owned by local, regional and institutional investors.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P20_S1	We provide these services through an extensive network of real estate experts in major markets throughout the United States.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	landlords who need to lease, buy, sell and/or finance space.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P21_S1	We believe our contractual relationships with these clients put us in an advantageous position to provide other services to them, including refinancing, disposition and appraisal.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	We typically receive monthly management fees for the asset services we provide based upon a specified percentage of the monthly rental income or rental receipts generated from the property under management, or in certain cases, the greater of such percentage fee or a minimum agreed-upon fee.

1138118_13_ITEM1_P34_S2	Our Development Services segment accounted for 1.2% of our 2012 revenue, 1.3% of our 2011 revenue and 1.5% of our 2010 revenue.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	Trammell Crow Company acts as the manager of development projects, providing services that are vital in all stages of the process, including: (i) site identification, due diligence and acquisition; (ii) evaluating project feasibility, budgeting, scheduling and cash flow analysis; (iii) procurement of approvals and permits, including zoning and other entitlements; (iv) project finance advisory services; (v) coordination of project design and engineering; (vi) construction bidding and management as well as tenant finish coordination; and (vii) project close-out and tenant move coordination.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	Trammell Crow Company may pursue development and investment activity on behalf of its user and investor clients (with no ownership), in partnership with its clients (through co-investment either on an individual project basis or through programs with certain strategic capital partners) or for its own account (100% ownership).
1138118_13_ITEM1_P36_S1	Development activity in which Trammell Crow Company has an ownership interest is conducted through subsidiaries that are consolidated or unconsolidated for financial reporting purposes, depending primarily on the extent and nature of our ownership interest.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P36_S2	As of December 31, 2012, our portfolio of consolidated real estate consisted of land, industrial, office and retail properties and mixed-use projects.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P36_S3	These projects are geographically dispersed throughout the United States.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	Included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were rental revenues (which are included in revenue) and expenses (which are included in operating, administrative and other expenses) relating to these operational real estate properties, excluding those reported as discontinued operations, of $35.4 million and $17.1 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2012, $41.1 million and $20.7 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2011 and $46.9 million and $24.6 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	At December 31, 2012, Trammell Crow Company had $4.2 billion of development projects in process.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P38_S1	Additionally, the inventory of pipeline deals (prospective projects we believe have a greater than 50% chance of closing or where land has been acquired and the projected construction start date is more than twelve months out) was $2.1 billion at December 31, 2012.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P39_S0	Competition We compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate industry, including commercial property and corporate facilities management, occupier and property/agency leasing, property sales, valuation, real estate investment management, commercial mortgage origination and servicing, capital markets (equity and debt) solutions, development services and proprietary research.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P39_S1	Each business discipline is highly competitive on an international, national, regional and local level.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P39_S2	Although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2012 revenue, our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies, property types and services.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P39_S3	Depending on the geography, property type or service, we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers, including outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have recently expanded their offerings, in-house corporate real estate departments, developers, institutional lenders, insurance companies, investment banking firms, investment managers and accounting and consulting firms.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P39_S4	Some of these firms may have greater financial resources than we do.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P40_S0	Despite recent consolidation, the commercial real estate services industry remains highly fragmented and competitive.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P40_S1	Although many of our competitors are local or regional firms and are substantially smaller than us, some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P40_S2	We are also subject to competition from other large multi-national firms that have similar service competencies to ours, including Cushman Wakefield, Jones Lang LaSalle and Savills plc, as well as national firms such as Newmark Grubb Knight Frank, and large global firms with significant business lines that compete with one or more of our business lines, such as Johnson Controls, Inc.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P41_S0	Seasonality A significant portion of our revenue is seasonal, which can affect an investor s ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P41_S1	Historically, this seasonality has caused our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P41_S2	Earnings and cash flow have historically been particularly concentrated in the fourth quarter due to investors and companies focusing on completing transactions prior to calendar year-end.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P41_S3	This has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first quarter, with revenue and profitability improving in each subsequent quarter.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P42_S0	Employees At December 31, 2012, excluding our independent affiliates, we had approximately 37,000 employees worldwide, approximately 44% of which are fully reimbursed by clients and are mostly in our outsourcing services lines of business.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P42_S1	At December 31, 2012, 967 of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements, most of whom are on-site employees in our asset services business in New York, New Jersey, Illinois and California.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P43_S0	We believe that relations with our employees are generally good.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P44_S0	We hold various trademarks and trade names worldwide, which include the CBRE name.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P44_S1	Although we believe our intellectual property plays a role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve, we do not believe we would be materially, adversely affected by expiration or termination of our trademarks or trade names or the loss of any of our other intellectual property rights other than the CBRE, CB Richard Ellis and Trammell Crow names.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P45_S0	With respect to the CBRE and CB Richard Ellis names, we maintain trademark registrations for these service marks in jurisdictions where we conduct significant business.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P45_S1	We obtained our most recent U.S. trademark registrations for the CBRE and CB Richard Ellis related marks in 2005, and these registrations would expire in 2015 if we failed to renew them.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P45_S2	We hold a license to use the Trammell Crow trade name pursuant to a license agreement with CF98, L.P., an affiliate of Crow Realty Investors, L.P., d/b/a Crow Holdings, which may be revoked if we fail to satisfy usage and quality control covenants under the license agreement.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P46_S0	In addition to trade names, we have developed proprietary technologies for the provision of complex services through our global outsourcing business and for preparing and developing valuation reports for our clients through our valuation business.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P46_S1	We also offer proprietary research to clients through our CBRE-EA research unit and we offer proprietary investment structures through CBRE Global Investors.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P47_S0	While we seek to secure our rights under applicable intellectual property protection laws in these and any other proprietary assets that we use in our business, we do not believe any of these other items of intellectual property are material to our business in the aggregate.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P48_S0	Environmental Matters Federal, state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business impose environmental liabilities, controls, disclosure rules and zoning restrictions that impact the ownership, management, development, use, or sale of commercial real estate.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P48_S1	Certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability on current or previous real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating, cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property, including contamination resulting from above-ground or underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos or lead at a property.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P48_S2	If contamination occurs or is present during our role as a property or facility manager or developer, we could be held liable for such costs as a current operator of a property, regardless of the legality of the acts or omissions that caused the contamination and without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P48_S3	The operator of a site also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from exposure to hazardous substances or environmental contamination at a site, including liabilities arising from exposure to asbestos-containing materials.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P49_S0	Under certain laws and common law principles, any failure by us to disclose environmental contamination at a property could subject us to liability to a buyer or lessee of the property.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P49_S1	Further, federal, state and local governments in the countries in which we do business have begun enacting various laws, regulations, and treaties governing environmental and climate change, particularly for greenhouse gases, which seek to tax, penalize, or limit the release.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P49_S2	Such regulations could lead to increased operational or compliance costs over time.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P50_S0	While we are aware of the presence or the potential presence of regulated substances in the soil or groundwater at or near several properties owned, operated or managed by us, which may have resulted from historical or ongoing activities on those properties, we are not aware of any material noncompliance with the environmental laws or regulations currently applicable to us, and we are not the subject of any material claim for liability with respect to contamination at any location.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P50_S1	However, these laws and regulations may discourage sales and leasing activities and mortgage lending with respect to some properties, which may adversely affect both us and the commercial real estate services industry in general.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P50_S2	Environmental contamination or other environmental liabilities may also negatively affect the value of commercial real estate assets held by entities that are managed by our investment management and development services businesses, which could adversely impact the results of operations of these business lines.

1138118_13_ITEM1_P52_S0	Item 1A. Risk Factors Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report and other public statements we make.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P52_S1	Based on the information currently known to us, we believe that the matters discussed below identify the material risk factors affecting our business.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P52_S2	However, the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P52_S3	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P52_S4	The success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and, accordingly, our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by economic slowdowns, liquidity crises, fiscal uncertainty and possible subsequent downturns in commercial real estate asset values, property sales and leasing activities.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P53_S0	Many of the world s largest economies and financial institutions continue to be impacted by ongoing global economic and financial issues, with some continuing to face financial difficulty, fiscal uncertainty, pressure on asset prices, liquidity problems and limited availability of credit, made worse in certain areas by increased unemployment or limited economic growth.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P53_S1	It is uncertain how long these effects will last, or whether economic and financial trends in those areas, particularly in Europe, will worsen or improve.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P54_S0	The current economic situation may be exacerbated if additional negative geo-political or economic developments, natural disasters or other disruptions were to arise.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P54_S1	Periods of economic weakness or recession, significantly rising interest rates, fiscal uncertainty, declining employment levels, declining demand for commercial real estate, falling real estate values, disruption to the global capital or credit markets, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, may negatively affect the performance of some or all of our business lines.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P55_S0	Our business is significantly impacted by generally prevailing economic conditions in the principal markets where we operate, which can result in a general decline in real estate acquisition, disposition and leasing activity, as well as a general decline in the value of commercial real estate and in rents, which in turn reduces revenue from property management fees and commissions derived from property sales, leasing, valuation and financing, as well as revenues associated with development or investment management activities.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P55_S1	Our capital markets business could also suffer from any political or economic disruption that impacts interest rates or liquidity.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P55_S2	In addition, we could experience a reduction in the amount of fees we earn in our Global Investment Management business if our assets under management decrease or those assets fail to perform as anticipated.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P55_S3	These economic conditions could also lead to a decline in property sales prices as well as a decline in funds invested in existing commercial real estate assets and properties planned for development.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P56_S0	Our development and investment strategy often entails making relatively modest investments alongside our investor clients.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P56_S1	Our ability to conduct these activities depends in part on the supply of investment capital for commercial real estate and related assets.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P56_S2	During an economic downturn, investment capital is usually constrained and it may take longer for us to dispose of real estate investments or selling prices may be lower than originally anticipated.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P56_S3	As a result, the value of our commercial real estate investments may be reduced and we could realize losses or diminished profitability.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P56_S4	In addition, economic downturns may reduce the amount of loan originations and related servicing by our commercial mortgage brokerage business.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P57_S0	Performance of our asset services line of business partially depends upon the performance of the properties we manage because our fees are generally based on a percentage of aggregate rent collections from these properties.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P57_S1	The performance of these properties may be impacted by many factors which are partially or completely outside of our control, including: (i) real estate and financial market conditions prevailing generally and locally, (ii) our ability to attract and retain creditworthy tenants, particularly during economic downturns; and (iii) the magnitude of defaults by tenants under their respective leases, which may increase during distressed conditions.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P57_S2	For example, during 2008 and 2009, credit became severely constrained and prohibitively expensive and real estate market activity contracted sharply in most markets around the world as a result of the global financial crisis and the deep economic recession.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P57_S3	These adverse macro conditions impacted commercial real estate services companies like ours by significantly hampering transaction activity and lowering real estate valuations.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P57_S4	Similar to other commercial real estate services firms, our transaction volumes fell during 2008 and most of 2009, and as a result, our stock price declined significantly.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P57_S5	If the economic and market conditions that prevailed in 2008 and 2009 were to return, our business performance and profitability could again deteriorate.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P57_S6	Most recently, in the United States, we believe that the prospect of higher capital gains taxes drove an increase in transactions in the fourth quarter of 2012, but that continued uncertainty over fiscal and tax policy has caused, and may continue to do so in 2013, our clients to delay or cancel commercial real estate transactions which may impact our revenues.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P58_S0	The economic situation in Europe has been particularly unstable, arising from the real prospect of a default by certain nations on their debt obligations and the possibility of a Eurozone break-up.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P58_S1	If such a default or break-up occurs, or if the measures taken to avert such a default or break-up create their own instability, the adverse impact will likely be global and significant.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P59_S0	Fiscal uncertainty as well as significant changes and volatility in the financial markets and business environment, and in the global political, security and competitive landscape, make it increasingly difficult for us to predict our revenue and earnings into the future.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P59_S1	As a result, any revenue or earnings guidance or outlook, which we have given or might give, may be overtaken by events, or may otherwise turn out to be inaccurate.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P59_S2	Though we endeavor to give reasonable estimates of future revenue and earnings at the time we give such guidance, based on then-current conditions, there is a significant risk that such guidance or outlook will turn out to be, or to have been, incorrect.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P60_S0	Adverse developments in the credit markets may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P60_S1	Our Global Investment Management, Development Services and Capital Markets (including investment property sales and debt and equity financing services) businesses are sensitive to credit cost and availability as well as marketplace liquidity.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P60_S2	Additionally, the revenues in all of our businesses are dependent to some extent on the overall volume of activity (and pricing) in the commercial real estate market.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P61_S0	Disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business of providing advisory services to owners, investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with the leasing, disposition and acquisition of property.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P61_S1	If our clients are unable to procure credit on favorable terms, there may be fewer completed leasing transactions, dispositions and acquisitions of property.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P61_S2	In addition, if purchasers of commercial real estate are not able to procure favorable financing resulting in the lack of disposition opportunities for our funds and projects, our Global Investment Management and Development Services businesses will be unable to generate incentive fees and we may also experience losses of co-invested equity capital if the disruption causes a permanent decline in the value of investments made.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P62_S0	In 2008 and 2009, the credit markets experienced a disruption of unprecedented magnitude.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P62_S1	This disruption reduced the availability and significantly increased the cost of most sources of funding.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P62_S2	In some cases, these sources were eliminated.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P63_S0	While the credit market has improved since the second half of 2009, liquidity remains constrained and it is impossible to predict when the market will return to normalcy.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P63_S1	This uncertainty may lead market participants to continue to act more conservatively, which may amplify decreases in demand and pricing in the markets we serve.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P64_S0	Our debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us and, in the event of a default, all of our borrowings would become immediately due and payable.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P64_S1	Our debt instruments, including our credit agreement, impose, and the terms of any future debt may impose, operating and other restrictions on us and many of our subsidiaries.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P64_S2	These restrictions affect, and in many respects limit or prohibit, our ability to:
1138118_13_ITEM1_P65_S0	finance ongoing operations, strategic acquisitions, investments or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest, including:
1138118_13_ITEM1_P66_S0	Our credit agreement currently requires us to maintain a minimum coverage ratio of EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) to total interest expense of 2.25x and a maximum leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) of 3.75x.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P67_S0	For example, we experienced a decline in EBITDA during the economic downturn in 2008 to 2009, which negatively impacted our minimum coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P67_S1	However, we significantly reduced our cost structure during 2008 and 2009, and, as a result of these cost reductions as well as renewed growth in our business, we were and continue to be well within compliance with the minimum coverage ratio and the maximum leverage ratio under our credit agreement.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P67_S2	Our coverage ratio of EBITDA to total interest expense was 10.45x for the year ended December 31, 2012 and our leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to EBITDA was 1.38x as of December 31, 2012.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P67_S3	We continue to monitor our projected compliance with these financial ratios and other terms of our credit agreement.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P67_S4	A breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our debt instruments.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P67_S5	If any such default occurs, the lenders under our credit agreement may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P67_S6	The lenders under our credit agreement also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P67_S7	If we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due, the lenders under our credit agreement will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt, which collateral is described in the immediately following risk factor.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P67_S8	If the debt under our credit agreement were to be accelerated, we cannot give assurance that this collateral would be sufficient to repay our debt.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P67_S9	If we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under our credit agreement, the lenders under such credit agreement could foreclose on, and acquire control of, substantially all of our assets.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P67_S10	Our credit agreement is jointly and severally guaranteed by us and substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P67_S11	Borrowings under our credit agreement are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the capital stock of our U.S. subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P67_S12	In addition, in connection with any amendment to our credit agreement, we may need to grant additional collateral to the lenders.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P67_S13	If we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due, the lenders under our credit agreement will have the right to proceed against this pledged capital stock and take control of substantially all of our assets.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P67_S14	Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could harm our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P68_S0	We are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P68_S1	We established term loans totaling approximately $800.0 million under our credit agreement in 2011 to finance the REIM Acquisitions.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P68_S2	As of December 31, 2012, our total debt, excluding notes payable on real estate (which are generally nonrecourse to us) and warehouse lines of credit (which are recourse only to our wholly-owned subsidiary, CBRE Capital Markets, and are secured by our related warehouse receivables), was approximately $2.5 billion.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P68_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2012, our interest expense was approximately $175.1 million.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P68_S4	Our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of, or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P68_S5	In addition, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or for other purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P68_S6	If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our debt, would increase.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P68_S7	If we are required to seek an amendment to our credit agreement, our debt service obligations may be substantially increased.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P68_S8	Our debt could have other important consequences, which include, but are not limited to, the following:
1138118_13_ITEM1_P69_S0	our level of debt may restrict us from raising additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and other general corporate requirements.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P69_S1	From time to time, Moody s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard Poor s Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., rate our significant outstanding debt.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P69_S2	These ratings and any downgrades thereof may impact our ability to borrow under any new agreements in the future, as well as the interest rates and other terms of any future borrowings, and could also cause a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock in addition to our outstanding debt instruments.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P70_S0	We cannot be certain that our earnings will be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P70_S1	If we do not have sufficient earnings, we may be required to seek to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or sell more securities, none of which we can guarantee that we will be able to do and which, if accomplished, may adversely impact our stock price.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P70_S2	We have limited restrictions on the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur, which may intensify the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our indebtedness.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P70_S3	Subject to the maximum amounts of indebtedness permitted by our credit agreement covenants, we are not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur in connection with the financing of our development activities, and we may in the future incur such indebtedness in order to decrease the amount of equity we invest in these activities.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P70_S4	Subject to certain covenants in our various bank credit agreements, we are also not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt CBRE Capital Markets may incur in connection with funding loan originations for multifamily properties having prior purchase commitments by a government sponsored entity.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P70_S5	If we experience defaults by multiple clients or counterparties, it could adversely affect our business.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P70_S6	We could be adversely affected by the actions and deteriorating financial condition and results of operations of certain of our clients or counterparties if that led to losses or defaults by one or more of them, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P70_S7	Any of our clients may experience a downturn in their business that may weaken their results of operations and financial condition.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P70_S8	As a result, a client may fail to make payments when due, become insolvent or declare bankruptcy.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P70_S9	Any client bankruptcy or insolvency, or the failure of any client to make payments when due, could result in losses to our company.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P70_S10	A client bankruptcy would delay or preclude full collection of amounts owed to us.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P70_S11	Additionally, certain corporate services and property management client agreements require that we advance payroll and other vendor costs on behalf of clients.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P70_S12	If such a client were to file bankruptcy or otherwise fail, we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for those costs or for the severance obligations we would incur as a result of the loss of the client.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P70_S13	The bankruptcy or insolvency of a significant counterparty (which may include co-brokers, lenders, insurance companies, hedging counterparties, service providers or other organizations with which we do business), or the failure of any significant counterparty to perform its contractual commitments, may result in disruption to our business or material losses to our company.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P71_S0	Our goodwill and other intangible assets could become further impaired, which may require us to take significant non-cash charges against earnings.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P71_S1	Under current accounting guidelines, we must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P71_S2	Any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of such analysis would result in a non-cash charge against earnings, which charge could materially adversely affect our reported results of operations, stockholders equity and our stock price.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P71_S3	For example, due to the severe market downturn and credit crisis, we determined in December 2008 that the negative impact of the global economic slowdown and resulting decline in our stock price represented an adverse change in our business climate, requiring us to undertake an interim evaluation of our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P71_S4	As a result, we incurred charges of $1.2 billion in connection with the impairment of goodwill and other non-amortizable intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2008.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P71_S5	A significant and sustained decline in our future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the economic environment, slower growth rates or if our stock price falls below our net book value per share for a sustained period, all could result in the need to perform additional impairment analysis in future periods.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P71_S6	If we were to conclude that a future write-down of goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary, then we would record such additional charges, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P71_S7	Our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees (including those acquired through acquisitions).
1138118_13_ITEM1_P71_S8	Our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees, including Robert E. Sulentic, our President and Chief Executive Officer.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P71_S9	Mr. Sulentic and certain other key employees are not parties to employment agreements with us.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P71_S10	We also are highly dependent upon the retention of our property sales and leasing professionals, who generate a significant amount of our revenues, as well as other revenue producing professionals.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P71_S11	The departure of any of our key employees (including those acquired through acquisitions), or the loss of a significant number of key revenue producers, if we are unable to quickly hire and integrate qualified replacements, could cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to suffer.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P71_S12	In addition, the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified support personnel in all areas of our business, including brokerage and property management personnel.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P71_S13	Competition for these personnel is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit, integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P71_S14	We use equity incentives to help retain and incentivize many of our key personnel.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P71_S15	Any significant decline in, or failure to grow, our stock price may result in an increased risk of loss of these key personnel.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P71_S16	If we are unable to attract and retain these qualified personnel, our growth may be limited and our business and operating results could suffer.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P71_S17	Our international operations subject us to social, political and economic risks of doing business in foreign countries.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P71_S18	We conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the United States and as a result, we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P71_S19	During 2012, we generated approximately 40% of our revenue from operations outside the United States.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P71_S20	With the REIM Acquisitions, the footprint of our Global Investment Management business significantly expanded, particularly in Europe and Asia.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P71_S21	Additional circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations include, but are not limited to, the following factors:
1138118_13_ITEM1_P72_S0	foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in countries such as China.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P73_S0	Although we maintain anti-corruption and anti-money laundering compliance programs throughout the company, violations of our compliance programs may result in criminal or civil sanctions, including material monetary fines, penalties, equitable remedies (including disgorgement), and other costs against us or our employees, and may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P73_S1	We have committed additional resources to expand our worldwide sales and marketing activities, to globalize our service offerings and products in selected markets and to develop local sales and support channels.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P73_S2	If we are unable to successfully implement these plans, maintain adequate long-term strategies that successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P73_S3	Our revenue and earnings may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P73_S4	Our revenue from non-U.S. operations is denominated primarily in the local currency where the associated revenue was earned.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P73_S5	During 2012, approximately 40% of our revenue was transacted in foreign currencies, the majority of which included the Euro, the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar, the Chinese yuan, the Hong Kong dollar, the Japanese yen, the Singapore dollar, the Australian dollar and the Indian rupee.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P74_S0	Our Global Investment Management business has a significant amount of Euro-denominated assets under management as well as associated revenue and earnings in Europe, which has seen a continuing crisis in sovereign debt resulting in a notable drop in the value of the Euro against the U.S. dollar.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P74_S1	Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may result in corresponding fluctuations in our assets under management, revenue and earnings.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P74_S2	Over time, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and the Euro relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P74_S3	Due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P74_S4	In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the Euro may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P74_S5	From time to time, our management uses currency hedging instruments, including foreign currency forward and option contracts and borrows in foreign currencies.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P74_S6	There can be no assurance that these hedging instruments will be available when needed.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P74_S7	Additionally, economic risks associated with these hedging instruments include unexpected fluctuations in inflation rates, which impact cash flow, and unexpected changes in the underlying net asset position.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P75_S0	Our growth has benefited significantly from acquisitions, which may not be available in the future or perform as expected.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P75_S1	A significant component of our growth has occurred through acquisitions, including our acquisition of the Trammell Crow Company in December 2006 and the REIM Acquisitions that we completed in the second half of 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P76_S0	to us, as well as sufficient liquidity and credit to fund these acquisitions.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P76_S1	We may incur significant additional debt from time to time to finance any such acquisitions, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our then-existing indebtedness.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P76_S2	If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our then-existing debt, would increase.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P76_S3	In addition, acquisitions involve risks that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P76_S4	Future acquisitions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transaction-related expenses, which include severance, lease termination, transaction and deferred financing costs, among others.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P77_S0	We have had, and may continue to experience, challenges in integrating operations and information technology systems acquired from other companies.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P77_S1	This could result in the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of our key employees or those of the acquired operations.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P77_S2	The integration process itself may be disruptive to our business as it requires coordination of geographically diverse organizations and implementation of new accounting and information technology systems.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P78_S0	We believe that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on operating and net income.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P78_S1	Acquisitions also frequently involve significant costs related to integrating information technology, accounting and management services and rationalizing personnel levels.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P79_S0	The anticipated benefits of the REIM Acquisitions may not be realized as we contemplated.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P79_S1	We completed the REIM Acquisitions with the expectation that such acquisitions would result in various benefits, including, among others, enhanced revenues and margins, a strengthened market position, cross-selling opportunities and operating efficiencies.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P79_S2	Achieving the anticipated benefits of the REIM Acquisitions will be subject to a number of uncertainties, including the realization of accretive benefits in the timeframe anticipated.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P79_S3	Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management s time and energy, which could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P80_S0	Our revenue, net income and cash flow generated by our Global Investment Management business can vary significantly as a result of market developments.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P80_S1	With the completion of the REIM Acquisitions, our Global Investment Management business significantly increased and became more globally diverse.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P80_S2	With the addition of the REIM funds, a substantial part of our fees are more recurring in nature.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P80_S3	However, the revenue, net income and cash flow generated by our Global Investment Management business are all somewhat variable, primarily due to the fact that management, transaction and incentive fees can vary as a result of market movements from one period to another.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P80_S4	The pace at which the real estate markets worldwide turned from positive to negative starting in 2007 and continuing into 2009 is an example of the market volatility to which we are subject and over which we have no control.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P81_S0	The underlying market conditions, decisions regarding the acquisition and disposition of fund and separate account assets, and the specifics of client mandates will cause the amount of asset management, transaction and incentive fees to vary from one product to another.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P81_S1	A substantial part of our fees are based upon the value of the assets we manage and if asset values deteriorate our asset management fees will decline as a result.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P81_S2	Our acquisition and disposition fees can decline as a result of delay in the deployment of capital or limited market liquidity.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P81_S3	We also earn incentive fees tied to portfolio performance, which fees may decline if there is a downturn in real estate markets and we fail to meet benchmarks or absolute return hurdles.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P81_S4	Finally, during periods of economic weakness or recession, existing and prospective clients in our Global Investment Management business may be less able or willing to commit new funds to real estate investments, which are inherently less liquid than many competing investment classes, thereby inhibiting the ability of our Global Investment Management business to raise new funds.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P82_S0	To the extent that clients in our Global Investment Management business seek to avoid paying fees they are obligated to pay, or seek to avoid deploying capital that has been committed, we could experience a decrease in collection of fees and interruptions to our client relationships and business.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P82_S1	Our real estate investment and co-investment activities subject us to real estate investment risks which could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flow.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P82_S2	An important part of the strategy for our Global Investment Management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P82_S3	As of December 31, 2012, we had committed $31.7 million to fund future co-investments, $27.9 million of which is expected to be funded during 2013.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P82_S4	In addition to required future capital contributions, some of the co-investment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P82_S5	The failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments, including damage to our reputation with our co-investment partners and clients, as well as the necessity of obtaining alternative funding from other sources that may be on disadvantageous terms for us and the other co-investors.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P82_S6	Participating as a co-investor is a very important part of our Global Investment Management business, which would suffer if we were unable to make these investments.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P83_S0	Although our debt instruments contain restrictions that limit our ability to provide capital to the entities holding direct or indirect interests in co-investments, we may provide this capital in many instances.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P83_S1	Selective investment in real estate projects is an important part of our Development Services business strategy and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investment.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P83_S2	As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately 35 consolidated real estate projects with invested equity of $11.6 million and $13.9 million of notes payable on real estate that are recourse to us (in addition to being recourse to the single-purpose entity that holds the real estate asset and is the primary obligor on the note payable).
1138118_13_ITEM1_P83_S3	In addition, at December 31, 2012, we were involved as a principal (in most cases, co-investing with our clients) in approximately 45 unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries with invested equity of $58.9 million and had committed additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries of $14.3 million.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P83_S4	We also guaranteed notes payable of these unconsolidated subsidiaries of $2.2 million, excluding guarantees for which we have outstanding liabilities accrued on our consolidated balance sheet.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P84_S0	During the ordinary course of our Development Services business, we provide numerous completion and budget guarantees requiring us to complete the relevant project within a specified timeframe and/or within a specified budget, with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P84_S1	While we generally have guaranteed maximum price contracts with reputable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees (which are intended to pass most of the risk to such contractors), there can be no assurance that we will not have to perform under any such guarantees.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P84_S2	If we are required to perform under a significant number of such guarantees, it could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P84_S3	Because the disposition of a single significant investment can impact our financial performance in any period, our real estate investment activities could increase fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flow.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P84_S4	In many cases, we have limited control over the timing of the disposition of these investments and the recognition of any related gain or loss, or incentive participation fee.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P84_S5	Poor performance of the investment programs that our Global Investment Management business manages would cause a decline in our revenue, net income and cash flow and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future programs.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P84_S6	In the event that any of the investment programs that our Global Investment Management business manages were to perform poorly, our revenue, net income and cash flow could decline because the value of the assets we manage would decrease, which would result in a reduction in some of our management fees, and our investment returns would decrease, resulting in a reduction in the incentive compensation we earn.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P85_S0	experience losses on co-investments of our own capital in such programs as a result of poor performance.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P85_S1	Investors and potential investors in our programs continually assess our performance, and our ability to raise capital for existing and future programs and maintain our current fee structure will depend on our continued satisfactory performance.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P85_S2	We are subject to substantial litigation risks and may face significant liabilities and/or damage to our professional reputation as a result of litigation allegations and negative publicity.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P85_S3	As a licensed real estate broker, we and our licensed employees are subject to regulatory due diligence, disclosure and standard-of-care obligations.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P85_S4	Failure to fulfill these obligations could subject us or our employees to litigation from parties who purchased, sold or leased properties that we or they brokered or managed.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P85_S5	We could become subject to claims by participants in real estate sales, as well as building owners and companies for whom we provide management services, alleging that we did not fulfill our regulatory and fiduciary obligations.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P86_S0	In addition, in our property management business, we hire and supervise third-party contractors to provide construction services for our managed properties.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P86_S1	While our role is limited to that of an agent for the owner, we may be subject to claims for construction defects or other similar actions.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P86_S2	The advice and services we render in our financial and valuation advisory businesses and the investment decisions we make in our Global Investment Management business and the activities of our investment banking and investment management professionals for or on behalf of our clients may subject them and us to the risk of third-party litigation.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P86_S3	Such litigation may arise from client or investor dissatisfaction with the performance of our programs, differences between actual values and appraised values, and a variety of other litigation claims, including allegations that we improperly exercised judgment, discretion, control or influence over client investments or that we breached fiduciary duties to clients.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P86_S4	For example, in our valuation and appraisal business, if market dynamics lead to a reduction in the market value of properties we have previously appraised, we may be subject to a higher risk of claims, including conflicts of interest claims, based on the circumstances of valuations previously issued.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P87_S0	Our valuation and appraisal services involve transactions where the value of the transaction is much greater than the fees we generate.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P87_S1	As a result, the consequences of errors that lead to damages might be disproportionately large in relation to the fees generated in the event our contractual protections or our insurance coverage are inadequate to protect us fully.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P87_S2	To the extent investors in our programs suffer losses resulting from fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or other similar misconduct, investors may have remedies against us, our investment programs or funds or our employees under the federal securities law and state law.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P87_S3	Moreover, we are exposed to risks of litigation or investigation by investors and regulators relating to allegations of our having engaged in transactions involving conflicts of interest that were not properly addressed.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P87_S4	Some of these litigation risks may be mitigated by the commercial insurance we maintain in amounts we believe are appropriate.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P87_S5	However, in the event of a substantial loss, our commercial insurance coverage and/or self-insurance reserve levels might not be sufficient to pay the full damages, or the scope of available coverage may not cover certain types of claims.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P87_S6	Further, the value of otherwise valid claims we hold under insurance policies could become uncollectible in the event of the covering insurance company s insolvency, although we seek to limit this risk by placing our commercial insurance only with highly-rated companies.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P87_S7	Any of these events could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P87_S8	We depend on our business relationships and our reputation for integrity and high-caliber professional services to attract and retain clients across our overall business, as well as investors for our Global Investment Management business.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P88_S0	In addition, if any lawsuits were brought against us and resulted in a finding of substantial legal liability, it could materially, adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us, which could materially impact our business.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P88_S1	A failure to appropriately deal with actual or perceived conflicts of interest could adversely affect our businesses.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P88_S2	Our company has a global platform with different business lines and a broad client base and is therefore subject to numerous potential, actual or perceived conflicts of interests in the provision of services to our existing and potential clients.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P88_S3	For example, conflicts may arise from our position as broker to both owners and tenants in commercial real estate lease transactions.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P88_S4	We have adopted various policies, controls and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts, but these policies and procedures may not be adequate and may not be adhered to by our employees.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P88_S5	Appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged and cause us to lose existing clients or fail to gain new clients if we fail, or appear to fail, to identify, disclose and manage potential conflicts of interest, which could have an adverse affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P88_S6	In addition, it is possible that in some jurisdictions regulations could be changed to limit our ability to act for parties where conflicts exist even with informed consent, which could limit our market share in those markets.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P89_S0	There can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P89_S1	Our joint venture activities involve unique risks that are often outside of our control which, if realized, could harm our business.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P89_S2	We have utilized joint ventures for commercial investments and local brokerage and other affiliations both in the United States and internationally, and we may acquire minority interests in other joint ventures in the future.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P89_S3	In many of these joint ventures, we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures and other participants may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P89_S4	In addition, the other participants may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P89_S5	If a joint venture participant acts contrary to our interest, it could harm our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P90_S0	We have numerous significant competitors and potential future competitors, some of which may have greater financial and operational resources than we do.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P90_S1	We compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate services industry, including commercial property and corporate facilities management, occupier and property/agency leasing, property sales, valuation, real estate investment management, commercial mortgage origination and servicing, capital markets (equity and debt) solutions, development services and proprietary research.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P90_S2	Although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2012 revenue, our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies, property types and services.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P90_S3	Depending on the geography, property type or service, we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers, including outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have recently expanded their offerings, in-house corporate real estate departments, developers, institutional lenders, insurance companies, investment banking firms, investment managers, and accounting and consulting firms.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P90_S4	Some of these firms may have greater financial resources than we do.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P90_S5	In addition, future changes in laws could lead to the entry of other competitors, such as financial institutions.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P90_S6	Although many of our competitors are local or regional firms and are substantially smaller than us, some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P90_S7	We are also subject to competition from other large national and multi-national firms that have similar service competencies to ours.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P90_S8	In general, there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively, to maintain current fee levels or margins, or maintain or increase our market share.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P91_S0	A significant portion of our operations are concentrated in California and our business could be harmed if there was an economic downturn in the California real estate markets.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P91_S1	During 2012, approximately 10% of our revenue was generated from transactions originating in California.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P92_S0	As a result of the geographic concentration in California, economic downturns in the California commercial real estate market, similar to recent downturns experienced in California, and particularly in the local economies in San Diego, Los Angeles and Orange County could harm our results of operations and disproportionately affect our business as compared to competitors who have less or different geographic concentrations.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P93_S0	We operate in many jurisdictions with complex and varied tax regimes.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P93_S1	Changes in tax rules or the outcome of tax assessments and audits could cause an adverse effect on our results.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P94_S0	We operate in many jurisdictions with complex and varied tax regimes, and are subject to different forms of taxation resulting in a variable effective tax rate.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P94_S1	In addition, from time to time we engage in transactions that involve different tax jurisdictions.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P95_S0	Due to the different tax laws in the many jurisdictions where we operate, we are often required to make subjective determinations.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P95_S1	The tax authorities in the various jurisdictions where we carry on business may not agree with the determinations that are made by us with respect to the application of tax law.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P95_S2	Such disagreements could result in disputes and, ultimately, in the payment of additional funds to the government authorities of foreign and local jurisdictions where we carry on business, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P95_S3	In addition, changes in tax rules or the outcome of tax assessments and audits could have an adverse effect on our results in any particular quarter.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P96_S0	Our estimate of tax related assets, liabilities, recoveries and expenses incorporates assumptions.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P96_S1	These assumptions include, but are not limited to, the tax laws in various jurisdictions, the effect of tax treaties between jurisdictions, taxable income projections, and the benefits of various restructuring plans.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P96_S2	To the extent that such assumptions differ from actual results, we may have to record additional income tax expenses and liabilities.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P96_S3	We are subject to the possibility of loss contingencies arising out of tax claims, assessments related to uncertain tax positions and provisions for specifically identified income tax exposures.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P96_S4	There are currently tax audits ongoing in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P96_S5	There can be no assurance that we will be successful in resolving potential tax claims that arise from these audits.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P96_S6	We have recorded provisions on the basis of the best current understanding; however, we could be required to book additional provisions in future periods for amounts that cannot be assessed at this stage.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P96_S7	Our failure to do so and/or the need to increase our provisions for such claims could have an adverse effect on our financial position.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P96_S8	If the assets in our defined benefit pension plans are not sufficient to meet the plans obligations, we may be required to make cash contributions to it and our liquidity may be adversely affected.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P97_S0	Our subsidiaries based in the United Kingdom maintain two contributory defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in the plans.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P97_S1	With respect to these plans, our historical policy has been to contribute annually, an amount to fund pension cost as actuarially determined and as required by applicable laws and regulations.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P97_S2	Our contributions to these plans are invested and, if these investments do not perform in the future as well as we expect, we will be required to provide additional funding to cover any shortfall.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P97_S3	The underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans included in pension liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, which are incorporated herein by reference, was $63.5 million and $60.9 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P97_S4	If the assets in our defined benefit pension plans continue to be insufficient to meet the plans obligations, we may be required to make substantial cash contributions preventing the use of such cash for other purposes and adversely affecting our liquidity.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P97_S5	If we fail to maintain and protect our intellectual property, or infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, our business could be harmed and we could incur financial penalties.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P97_S6	Our business depends, in part, on our ability to identify and protect proprietary information and other intellectual property (such as our service marks, client lists and information, business methods and research).
1138118_13_ITEM1_P98_S0	Existing laws, or the application of those laws, of some countries in which we operate may offer only limited protections for our intellectual property rights.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P98_S1	We rely on a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality policies, non-disclosure and other contractual arrangements, and on patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P98_S2	Our inability to detect unauthorized use or take appropriate or timely steps to enforce our rights may have an adverse effect on our business.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P98_S3	We cannot be sure that the intellectual property that we may use in the course of operating our business or the services we offer to clients do not infringe on the rights of third parties, and we may have infringement claims asserted against us or against our clients.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P98_S4	These claims may harm our reputation, cost us money and prevent us from offering some services.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P99_S0	Confidential intellectual property is increasingly stored or carried on mobile devices, such as laptop computers, which makes inadvertent disclosure more of a risk in the event the mobile devices are lost or stolen and the information has not been adequately safeguarded or encrypted.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P100_S0	Failure to maintain the security of our information and technology networks, including personally identifiable and client information could adversely affect us.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P100_S1	Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P101_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and intellectual property, and that of our clients and personally identifiable information of our employees and contractors, in our data centers and on our networks.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P101_S1	The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P101_S2	Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P101_S3	A significant actual or potential theft, loss, fraudulent use or misuse of client, employee or other personally identifiable data, whether by third parties or as a result of employee malfeasance or otherwise, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could result in significant costs, fines, litigation or regulatory actions against us.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P101_S4	Such an event could additionally disrupt our operations and the services we provide to clients, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our services, which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P101_S5	Additionally, we increasingly rely on third-party data storage providers, including cloud storage solution providers, resulting in less direct control over our data.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P101_S6	Such third parties may also be vulnerable to security breaches and compromised security systems, which could adversely affect our reputation.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P101_S7	Interruption or failure of our information technology, communications systems or data services could hurt our ability to effectively provide our services, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P101_S8	Our business requires the continued operation of information technology and communication systems and network infrastructure.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P101_S9	Our ability to conduct our global business may be adversely impacted by disruptions to these systems or infrastructure.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P101_S10	Our information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or disruption from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, system malfunctions, computer viruses, natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and floods, acts of war or terrorism, or other events which are beyond our control.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P101_S11	In addition, the operation and maintenance of these systems and networks is in some cases dependent on third-party technologies, systems and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P101_S12	Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data or intellectual property and may also disrupt our ability to provide services to or interact with our clients, and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication or travel.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P101_S13	We have disaster recovery plans and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events, but our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient and cannot account for all eventualities and a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be adversely affected.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P102_S0	The infrastructure disruptions we describe above may also disrupt our ability to manage real estate for clients or may adversely affect the value of real estate investments we make on behalf of clients.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P103_S0	The buildings we manage for clients, which include some of the world s largest office properties and retail centers, are used by numerous people daily.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P103_S1	As a result, fires, earthquakes, floods, other natural disasters, defects and terrorist attacks can result in significant loss of life, and, to the extent we are held to have been negligent in connection with our management of the affected properties, we could incur significant financial liabilities and reputational harm.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P104_S0	Our business relies significantly on the use of commercial real estate data.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P104_S1	We produce much of this data internally, but a significant portion is purchased from third-party providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P104_S2	A disruption of our ability to provide data to our professionals and/or clients could damage our reputation, and our operating results could be adversely affected.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P104_S3	Our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected by new laws or regulations or by changes in existing laws or regulations or the application thereof.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P104_S4	If we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us, including in our role as a real estate broker, registered investment advisor, mortgage broker, property/facility manager or developer, we may incur significant financial penalties.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P104_S5	We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations specific to the services we perform in our business, as well as laws of broader applicability, such as tax, securities, environmental and employment laws.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P104_S6	Brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions and the provision of property management and valuation services require us to maintain applicable licenses in each U.S. state and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we perform these services.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P104_S7	If we fail to maintain our licenses or conduct these activities without a license, or violate any of the regulations covering our licenses, we may be required to pay fines (including treble damages in certain states) or return commissions received or have our licenses suspended or revoked.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P104_S8	A number of our services, including the services provided by our indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, CBRE Capital Markets and CBRE Global Investors, are subject to regulation by the SEC, FINRA or other self-regulatory organizations and state securities regulators and compliance failures or regulatory action could adversely affect our business.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P104_S9	We could be subject to disciplinary or other actions in the future due to claimed noncompliance with these regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P105_S0	As the size and scope of commercial real estate transactions have increased significantly during the past several years, both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with numerous licensing regimes and the possible loss resulting from non-compliance have increased.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P105_S1	The global economic crisis has resulted in increased government and legislative activities, including the introduction of new legislation and changes to rules and regulations, which we expect will continue into the future.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P105_S2	New or revised legislation or regulations applicable to our business, both within and outside of the United States, as well as changes in administrations or enforcement priorities may have an adverse effect on our business, including increasing the costs of compliance or preventing us from providing certain types of services in certain jurisdictions or in connection with certain transactions or clients.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P105_S3	We are unable to predict how any of these new laws, rules, regulations and proposals will be implemented or in what form, or whether any additional or similar changes to laws or regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, will occur in the future.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P105_S4	Any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P106_S0	We may be subject to environmental liability as a result of our role as a property or facility manager or developer of real estate.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P107_S0	Various laws and regulations impose liability on real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating, cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P107_S1	In our role as a property or facility manager or developer, we could be held liable as an operator for such costs.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P108_S0	liability may be imposed without regard to the legality of the original actions and without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P108_S1	If we fail to disclose environmental issues, we could also be liable to a buyer or lessee of a property.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P108_S2	If we incur any such liability, our business could suffer significantly as it could be difficult for us to develop or sell such properties, or borrow funds using such properties as collateral.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P108_S3	In the event of a substantial liability, our insurance coverage might be insufficient to pay the full damages, or the scope of available coverage may not cover certain of these liabilities.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P108_S4	Additionally, liabilities incurred to comply with more stringent future environmental requirements could adversely affect any or all of our lines of business.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P109_S0	This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P109_S1	The words anticipate, believe, could, should, propose, continue, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, predict, project, will and similar terms and phrases are used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to identify forward-looking statements.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P109_S2	Except for historical information contained herein, the matters addressed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking statements.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P110_S0	These statements relate to analyses and other information based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P110_S1	These statements also relate to our future prospects, developments and business strategies.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P110_S2	These forward-looking statements are made based on our management s expectations and beliefs concerning future events affecting us and are subject to uncertainties and factors relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P110_S3	These uncertainties and factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those matters expressed in or implied by these forward-looking statements.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P110_S4	The following factors are among those, but are not only those, that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements:
1138118_13_ITEM1_P111_S0	the other factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, included under the headings Risk Factors , Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

1138118_13_ITEM1_P112_S1	You should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.

1138118_13_ITEM1_P112_S3	If we do update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P112_S4	Additional information concerning these and other risks and uncertainties is contained in our other periodic filings with the SEC.
1138118_13_ITEM1_P112_S5	Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable.
1138118_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	of December 31, 2012: Some of our offices that contain employees of our Global Investment Management or our Development Services segments also contain employees of our other business segments.
1138118_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	Often, the employees of these segments occupy separate suites in the same building in order to operate the businesses independently with standalone offices.
1138118_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	We have provided above office totals by geographic region and not listed all of our Global Investment Management and Development Services offices to avoid double counting.
1138118_13_ITEM2_P1_S1	In general, these leased offices are fully utilized.
1138118_13_ITEM2_P2_S0	The most significant terms of the leasing arrangements for our offices are the length of the lease and the rent.
1138118_13_ITEM2_P2_S1	Our leases have terms varying in duration.
1138118_13_ITEM2_P2_S2	The rent payable under our office leases varies significantly from location to location as a result of differences in prevailing commercial real estate rates in different geographic locations.
1138118_13_ITEM2_P3_S0	Our management believes that no single office lease is material to our business, results of operations or financial condition.
1138118_13_ITEM2_P3_S1	In addition, we believe there is adequate alternative office space available at acceptable rental rates to meet our needs, although adverse movements in rental rates in some markets may negatively affect our profits in those markets when we enter into new leases.
1138118_13_ITEM2_P3_S2	We do not own any offices, which is consistent with our strategy to lease instead of own.
1138118_13_ITEM2_P3_S3	Legal Proceedings We are a party to a number of pending or threatened lawsuits arising out of, or incident to, our ordinary course of business.
1138118_13_ITEM2_P3_S4	Our management believes that any losses in excess of the amounts accrued arising from such lawsuits are remote, but that litigation is inherently uncertain and there is the potential for a material adverse effect on our financial statements if one or more matters are resolved in a particular period in an amount in excess of that anticipated by management.
1138118_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	the last two fiscal years, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange, are set forth below for the periods indicated.
1138118_13_ITEM5_P1_S0	The closing share price for our Class A common stock on December 31, 2012, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange, was $19.90.
1138118_13_ITEM5_P1_S1	As of February 13, 2013, there were 316 stockholders of record of our Class A common stock.
1138118_13_ITEM5_P1_S2	We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on any class of our common stock since our inception on February 20, 2001, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.
1138118_13_ITEM5_P1_S3	We currently intend to retain any future earnings to reduce debt and finance future growth.
1138118_13_ITEM5_P1_S4	Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors that the board of directors deems relevant.
1138118_13_ITEM5_P1_S5	In addition, our ability to declare and pay cash dividends is restricted by the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility and senior secured term loan facilities.
1138118_13_ITEM5_P2_S0	Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities None.
1138118_13_ITEM5_P2_S1	Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities None.

1138118_13_ITEM5_P3_S1	The graph also shows the cumulative total returns of the Standard Poor s 500 Stock Index, or S P 500 Index, in which we are included, and an industry peer group.
1138118_13_ITEM5_P4_S0	The comparison below assumes $100 was invested on December 31, 2007 in our Class A common stock and in each of the indices shown and assumes that all dividends were reinvested.
1138118_13_ITEM5_P5_S0	Our stock price performance shown in the following graph is not indicative of future stock price performance.
1138118_13_ITEM5_P6_S0	The industry peer group is comprised of Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (JLL), a global commercial real estate services company publicly traded in the United States, as well as the following companies that have significant commercial real estate or real estate capital markets businesses within the United States or globally, that in each case are publicly traded in the United States or abroad: BGC Partners (BGCP), which is the publicly traded parent of Newmark Grubb Knight Frank; HFF, L.P.

1138118_13_ITEM5_P7_S0	These companies are or include divisions with business lines reasonably comparable to some or all of ours, and which represent our primary competitors.
1138118_13_ITEM5_P7_S1	The peer group in our 2011 Form 10-K was comprised of only JLL and Grubb Ellis Company, the latter of which was subsequently acquired by BGCP out of bankruptcy during 2012.
1138118_13_ITEM5_P7_S2	We have revised this peer group to account for the bankruptcy of Grubb Ellis Company, to include other competitors inside and outside the United States reflecting the increasingly global nature of the industry, and to include diversified companies that have significant commercial real estate business lines.
1138118_13_ITEM5_P7_S3	A presentation of the 2011 peer group is not presented because, following the bankruptcy of Grubb Ellis Company, it would only include JLL.

1138118_13_ITEM6_P2_S0	(1) In 2011, we acquired the majority of the real estate investment management business of Netherlands-based ING Group N.V. (ING).
1138118_13_ITEM6_P2_S1	The acquisitions included substantially all of ING s Real Estate Investment Management (REIM) operations in Europe and Asia as well as substantially all of Clarion Real Estate Securities (CRES), its U.S.-based global real estate listed securities business (collectively referred to as ING REIM) along with certain CRES co-investments from ING and additional interests in other funds managed by ING REIM Europe and ING REIM Asia.
1138118_13_ITEM6_P2_S2	On July 1, 2011, we completed the acquisition of CRES for $332.8 million and CRES co-investments from ING for an aggregate amount of $58.6 million.
1138118_13_ITEM6_P2_S3	On October 3, 2011, we completed the acquisition of ING REIM Asia for $45.3 million and three ING REIM Asia co-investments from ING for an aggregate amount of $13.9 million.
1138118_13_ITEM6_P2_S4	On October 31, 2011, we completed the acquisition of ING REIM Europe for $441.5 million and one co-investment from ING for $7.4 million.
1138118_13_ITEM6_P2_S5	During the year ended December 31, 2012, we also funded nine additional co-investments for an aggregate amount of $34.5 million related to ING REIM Europe.
1138118_13_ITEM6_P2_S6	The results for the year ended December 31, 2011 include the operations of CRES, ING REIM Asia and ING REIM Europe from July 1, 2011, October 3, 2011 and October 31, 2011, respectively, the dates each respective business was acquired.

1138118_13_ITEM6_P4_S1	Our management believes EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions.
1138118_13_ITEM6_P4_S2	Such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.
1138118_13_ITEM6_P4_S3	As a result, our management uses EBITDA as a measure to evaluate the operating performance of our various business segments and for other discretionary purposes, including as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive programs.
1138118_13_ITEM6_P4_S4	Additionally, we believe EBITDA is useful to investors to assist them in getting a more complete picture of our results from operations.
1138118_13_ITEM6_P4_S5	However, EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and when analyzing our operating performance, readers should use EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP.
1138118_13_ITEM6_P4_S6	Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
1138118_13_ITEM6_P4_S7	Furthermore, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management s discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.
1138118_13_ITEM6_P4_S8	The amounts shown for EBITDA also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
1138118_13_ITEM6_P5_S0	EBITDA is calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_13_ITEM6_P6_S0	(iv) Includes interest income related to discontinued operations of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
1138118_13_ITEM6_P7_S0	(4) Notes payable on real estate disclosed here includes the current and long-term portions of notes payable on real estate as well as notes payable included in liabilities related to real estate and other assets held for sale.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	We are the world s largest commercial real estate services and investment firm, based on 2012 revenue, with leading full-service operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P0_S1	We offer a full range of services to occupiers, owners, lenders and investors in office, retail, industrial, multifamily and other types of commercial real estate.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P0_S2	As of December 31, 2012, excluding independent affiliates, we operated in more than 300 offices worldwide, with approximately 37,000 employees providing commercial real estate services under the CBRE brand name, investment management services under the CBRE Global Investors brand name and development services under the Trammell Crow brand name.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P0_S3	Our business is focused on several competencies, including commercial property and corporate facilities management, occupier and property/agency leasing, property sales, real estate investment management, valuation, commercial mortgage origination and servicing, capital markets (equity and debt) solutions, development services and proprietary research.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P0_S4	We generate revenue from management fees on a contractual and per-project basis, and from commissions on transactions.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P0_S5	We have been the only commercial real estate services company in the S P 500 since 2006, and in the Fortune 500 since 2008.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P0_S6	In 2012, for the second year in a row, we were the highest ranked commercial real estate services company among the Fortune Most Admired Companies, and were also named the Global Real Estate Advisor of the Year by Euromoney .
1138118_13_ITEM7_P0_S7	Additionally, the International Association of Outsourcing Professionals has included us among the top 100 global outsourcing companies across all industries for six consecutive years, including 2012 when we ranked fourth overall and were the highest ranked commercial real estate services company.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P0_S8	In its most recent subscriber survey, conducted in late 2011, we achieved the highest brand reputation ranking among all commercial real estate companies in a survey of Wall Street Journal subscribers.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	When you read our financial statements and the information included in this section, you should consider that we have experienced, and continue to experience, several material trends and uncertainties that have affected our financial condition and results of operations that make it challenging to predict our future performance based on our historical results.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	We believe that the following material trends and uncertainties are crucial to an understanding of the variability in our historical earnings and cash flows and the potential for continued variability in the future: Macroeconomic Conditions Economic trends and government policies affect global and regional commercial real estate markets as well as our operations directly.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P1_S2	These include: overall economic activity and employment growth, interest rate levels, the cost and availability of credit and the impact of tax and regulatory policies.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P1_S3	Periods of economic weakness or recession, significantly rising interest rates, fiscal uncertainty, declining employment levels, decreasing demand for commercial real estate, falling real estate values, disruption to the global capital or credit markets, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, may negatively affect the performance of some or all of our business lines.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P1_S4	From late 2007 through 2009, the severe global economic downturn and credit market crisis had significant adverse effects on our operations and materially reduced our revenue from property management fees and commissions derived from property sales, leasing, valuation and financing, and reduced the funds available to invest in commercial real estate and related assets.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P1_S5	These negative trends began to reverse in early 2010 and commercial real estate markets have improved gradually for the past three years in step with the slow recovery of global economic activity.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P1_S6	Weak economic conditions from late 2007 through 2009 also affected our compensation expense, which is structured to generally decrease in line with a fall in revenue.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P1_S7	Compensation is our largest expense and the sales and leasing professionals in our largest line of business, advisory services, generally are paid on a commission and bonus basis that correlates with their revenue production.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P1_S8	As a result, the negative effect of difficult market conditions on our operating margins was partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P1_S9	In addition, when negative economic conditions are particularly severe, as they were in 2008 and 2009, we have moved decisively to improve financial performance by lowering operating expenses.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P1_S10	As general economic conditions and our financial performance improved, we restored certain expenses beginning in 2010.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	Notwithstanding the ongoing, slow market recovery, a return of adverse global and regional economic trends given U.S. fiscal uncertainty, a continuing sovereign debt crisis in Europe and slower growth in China, remains one of the most significant risks to the performance of our operations and our financial condition.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Economic conditions first began to negatively affect our performance in the Americas, our largest segment in terms of revenue, beginning in the third quarter of 2007.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	The effects became more severe as the decline in economic activity (particularly in the United States) accelerated throughout 2008 and most of 2009.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P3_S2	The global capital markets disruption in late 2008, in particular, caused a significant and prolonged decline in property sales, leasing, financing and investment activity that adversely affected all our business lines.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	Commercial real estate fundamentals began to stabilize in early 2010 and have steadily improved for the past three years due to the slow but positive economic recovery in the United States.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	Reflecting this gradual recovery, national vacancy rates in the United States declined modestly and rental rates rose slightly in 2012, while the ready availability of low-cost credit and investors search for yield sustained continued increases in property sales activity.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P4_S2	Overall, however, occupiers and investors have remained cautious and both sales and leasing activity continued to be well below the levels experienced in 2006 and 2007.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	In Europe, weak market conditions first became evident in the United Kingdom in late 2007 and in countries on the continent in early 2008.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	The major European economies fell into recession in 2008, which deepened and persisted throughout 2009.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	Economic activity improved in 2010, but began to weaken again in 2011 and 2012, due to the effects of the European sovereign debt crisis.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P6_S2	As a result, economic growth in Europe has lagged behind other parts of the world for the past two years.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P6_S3	While rents have essentially remained flat, leasing velocity has slowed in many major markets in Europe, as occupiers hesitate to make long-term space commitments.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	Investment sales in Europe were adversely affected by the financial crisis in late 2008 and most of 2009.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	Although they recovered strongly in 2010, particularly in larger markets, investment sales have been tepid across most of Europe for the past two years.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P7_S2	European sovereign debt issues and weak economic growth have resulted in a polarization of the investment market, with capital flowing primarily to markets perceived as safe havens, such as the United Kingdom.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P7_S3	Real estate markets in Asia Pacific were also affected, though generally to a lesser degree than in the United States and Europe, by the global credit market dislocation and economic downturn in 2008 and 2009.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P7_S4	This resulted in lower investment sales and leasing activity in the region.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P7_S5	Transaction activity revived significantly in late 2009 and remained strong throughout 2010 and most of 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P7_S6	However, transaction activity has moderated for the past 18 months, as both occupiers and investors have become more cautious, reflecting slower domestic growth and the effects of economic uncertainty in the United States and Europe on the region s export-based economies.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P7_S7	Real estate investment management and property development activity were also adversely affected by deteriorating conditions beginning in late 2007, driving down property values, and constraining financing and disposition opportunities.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P7_S8	However, the macro environment for these businesses has generally improved as the real estate credit and investment sales markets have gradually recovered for the past three years.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P7_S9	The further recovery of our global sales, leasing, investment management and development services operations depends on the continued strengthening of market fundamentals, including more robust economic growth and job creation; stable and healthy global credit markets; and improved business and investor confidence.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	Effects of Acquisitions Our management historically has made significant use of strategic acquisitions to add new service competencies, to increase our scale within existing competencies and to expand our presence in various geographic regions around the world.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	In December 2006, we acquired the Trammell Crow Company (the Trammell Crow Company Acquisition), our largest acquisition to date, which deepened our outsourcing services offerings for corporate and institutional clients, especially project and facilities management, strengthened our ability to provide integrated management solutions across geographies, and established resources and expertise to offer real estate development services throughout the United States.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	In 2011, we acquired the majority of the real estate investment management business of Netherlands-based ING Group N.V. (ING).
1138118_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	The acquisitions included substantially all of ING s Real Estate Investment Management (REIM) operations in Europe and Asia, as well as substantially all of Clarion Real Estate Securities (CRES), its U.S.-based global real estate listed securities business (collectively referred to as ING REIM) along with certain CRES co-investments from ING and additional interests in other funds managed by ING REIM Europe and ING REIM Asia.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P9_S2	On July 1, 2011, we completed the acquisition of CRES for $332.8 million and CRES co-investments from ING for an aggregate amount of $58.6 million.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P9_S3	On October 3, 2011, we completed the acquisition of ING REIM Asia for $45.3 million and three ING REIM Asia co-investments from ING for an aggregate amount of $13.9 million.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P9_S4	On October 31, 2011, we completed the acquisition of ING REIM Europe for $441.5 million and one co-investment from ING for $7.4 million.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P9_S5	During the year ended December 31, 2012, we also funded nine additional co-investments for an aggregate amount of $34.5 million related to ING REIM Europe.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P9_S6	Upon completion of the acquisitions, which we refer to as the REIM Acquisitions, ING REIM became part of our Global Investment Management segment (which conducts business through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, CBRE Global Investors, an independently operated business segment).
1138118_13_ITEM7_P9_S7	The ING REIM businesses were highly complementary to our existing investment management business, with little overlap in client base and different investment strategies.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	CBRE Global Investors traditionally focused on value-add funds and separate accounts.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	ING REIM primarily focused on core funds and global listed real estate securities funds, except in Asia, where ING REIM managed value-add and opportunistic funds.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P10_S2	The combined entity provides us with a significantly enhanced ability to meet the needs of institutional investors across global markets with a full spectrum of investment programs and strategies.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	As of December 31, 2012, CBRE Global Investors assets under management, or AUM, totaled $92.0 billion.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	AUM generally refers to the properties and other assets with respect to which we provide (or participate in) oversight, investment management services and other advice, and which generally consist of real estate properties or loans, securities portfolios and investments in operating companies and joint ventures.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P11_S2	Our AUM is intended principally to reflect the extent of our presence in the real estate market, not the basis for determining our management fees.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P11_S3	Our material assets under management consist of:
1138118_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	a) the total fair market value of the real estate properties and other assets either wholly-owned or held by joint ventures and other entities in which our sponsored funds or investment vehicles and client accounts have invested or to which they have provided financing.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	Committed (but unfunded) capital from investors in our sponsored funds is not included in this component of our AUM.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P12_S2	The value of development properties is included at estimated completion cost.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	b) the net asset value of our managed securities portfolios, including investments (which may be comprised of committed but uncalled capital) in private real estate funds under our fund of funds program.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	Our calculation of AUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	Strategic in-fill acquisitions have also played a key role in expanding our geographic coverage and broadening and strengthening our service offerings.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	The companies we acquired have generally been quality regional or specialty firms that complement our existing platform within a region, or affiliates in which, in some cases, we held a small equity interest.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P14_S2	From 2005 to 2010, we completed 60 in-fill acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $601 million, with most of these completed before the recession in 2008.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P14_S3	In 2011, we completed five in-fill acquisitions, including a valuation business in Australia, a retail property management business in central and eastern Europe, our former affiliate company in Switzerland, a retail services business in the United Kingdom and a shopping center management business in the Netherlands.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	2012, we completed five in-fill acquisitions, including our former affiliate companies in Turkey and Vietnam, a niche real estate investment advisor and an independent commercial and residential property partnership in the United Kingdom, and a brokerage and property management firm in Atlanta.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P15_S1	As market conditions continue to improve, we believe acquisitions may once again serve as a growth engine, supplementing our organic growth.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	Although our management believes that strategic acquisitions can significantly decrease the cost, time and commitment of management resources necessary to attain a meaningful competitive position within targeted markets or to expand our presence within our current markets, our management also believes that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating and net income, both as a result of transaction-related expenditures, which include severance, lease termination, transaction and deferred financing costs, among others, and the charges and costs of integrating the acquired business and its financial and accounting systems into our own.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	For example, through December 31, 2012, we incurred $258.9 million of transaction-related expenditures and integration costs in connection with the Trammell Crow Company Acquisition.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P16_S2	In addition, through December 31, 2012, we incurred $109.4 million of transaction-related expenditures and integration costs in connection with the REIM Acquisitions.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	International Operations As we increase our international operations through either acquisitions or organic growth, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	Our management team generally seeks to mitigate our exposure by balancing assets and liabilities that are denominated in the same currency and by maintaining cash positions outside the United States only at levels necessary for operating purposes.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P17_S2	In addition, from time to time we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate changes related to particular transactions and to hedge risks associated with the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P17_S3	Our Global Investment Management business has a significant amount of Euro-denominated assets under management as well as associated revenue and earnings in Europe, which has seen a developing crisis in sovereign debt resulting in a more pronounced movement in the value of the Euro against the U.S. dollar.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P17_S4	Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have resulted and may continue to result in corresponding fluctuations in our AUM, revenue and earnings.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P17_S5	Due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P17_S6	In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P17_S7	Our international operations also are subject to, among other things, political instability and changing regulatory environments, which may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P17_S8	Our management routinely monitors these risks and related costs and evaluates the appropriate amount of resources to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P17_S9	We are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P17_S10	As of December 31, 2012, our total debt, excluding our notes payable on real estate (which are generally nonrecourse to us) and warehouse lines of credit (which are recourse only to our wholly-owned subsidiary, CBRE Capital Markets, Inc., or CBRE Capital Markets, and are secured by our related warehouse receivables), was approximately $2.5 billion.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P17_S11	Our level of indebtedness and the operating and financial restrictions in our debt agreements place constraints on the operation of our business.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	business and in the commercial real estate services industry.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	Our management seeks to mitigate this exposure both through the refinancing of debt when available on attractive terms and through selective repayment and retirement of indebtedness.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that management believes to be reasonable.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P19_S2	Actual results may differ from those estimates.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P19_S3	We believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
1138118_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	Revenue Recognition In order for us to recognize revenue, there are four basic criteria that must be met:
1138118_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	Our revenue recognition policies are consistent with these criteria.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	The judgments involved in revenue recognition include understanding the complex terms of agreements and determining the appropriate time to recognize revenue for each transaction based on such terms.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	Each transaction is evaluated to determine: (i) at what point in time revenue is earned, (ii) whether contingencies exist that impact the timing of recognition of revenue and (iii) how and when such contingencies will be resolved.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P22_S2	The timing of revenue recognition could vary if different judgments were made.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P22_S3	Our revenues subject to the most judgment are brokerage commission revenue and incentive-based management and development fees.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P22_S4	We record commission revenue on real estate sales generally upon close of escrow or transfer of title, except when future contingencies exist.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P22_S5	Real estate commissions on leases are generally recorded in revenue when all obligations under the commission agreement are satisfied.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	Terms and conditions of a commission agreement may include, but are not limited to, execution of a signed lease agreement and future contingencies including tenant occupancy, payment of a deposit or payment of a first month s rent (or a combination thereof).
1138118_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	As some of these conditions are outside of our control and are often not clearly defined, judgment must be exercised in determining when such required events have occurred in order to recognize revenue.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	A typical commission agreement provides that we earn a portion of a lease commission upon the execution of the lease agreement by the tenant and landlord, with the remaining portion(s) of the lease commission earned at a later date, usually upon tenant occupancy or payment of rent.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	The existence of any significant future contingencies results in the delay of recognition of corresponding revenue until such contingencies are satisfied.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P24_S2	For example, if we do not earn all or a portion of the lease commission until the tenant pays its first month s rent, and the lease agreement provides the tenant with a free rent period, we delay revenue recognition until rent is paid by the tenant.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	Property management revenues are generally based upon percentages of the revenue or base rent generated by the entities managed or the square footage managed.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	These fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related management agreements.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	Investment management fees are based predominantly upon a percentage of the equity deployed on behalf of our limited partners.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	Fees related to our indirect investment management programs are based upon a percentage of the fair value of those investments.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	Our Global Investment Management segment also earns performance-based incentive fees with regard to many of its investments.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	Such revenue is recognized at the end of the measurement periods when the conditions of the applicable incentive fee arrangements have been satisfied and following the expiration of any potential claw back provision.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P27_S2	With many of these investments, our Global Investment Management team has participation interests in such incentive fees, which are commonly referred to as carried interest.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P27_S3	This carried interest expense is generally accrued for based upon the probability of such performance-based incentive fees being earned over the related vesting period.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P27_S4	In addition, our Global Investment Management segment also earns success-based transaction fees with regard to buying or selling properties on behalf of certain funds and separate accounts.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P27_S5	Such revenue is recognized at the completion of a successful transaction and is not subject to any claw back provision.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	We earn development and incentive development fees in our Development Services segment.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	Development fees are generally based on a percentage of a defined cost measure and are recognized at the lower of the amount billed or the amount determined on a straight-line basis over the development period.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P28_S2	Incentive development fees are recognized when quantitative criteria have been met (such as specified leasing or budget targets) or, for those incentive fees based on qualitative criteria, upon approval of the fee by our clients.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	Certain incentive development fees allow us to share in the fair value of the developed real estate asset above cost.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P29_S1	This sharing creates additional revenue potential to us with no exposure to loss other than opportunity cost.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P29_S2	Our incentive development fee revenue is not recognized to the extent that such revenue is subject to future performance contingencies, but rather once the contingency has been resolved.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P29_S3	The unique nature and complexity of each incentive fee requires us to use varying levels of judgment in determining the timing of revenue recognition.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	In establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables, we make assumptions with respect to future collectability.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	Our assumptions are based on an assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends, including the aging of receivables balances.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P30_S2	In addition to these assessments, in general, outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are more than 180 days overdue are evaluated for collectability and fully provided for if deemed uncollectible.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	Historically, our credit losses have generally been insignificant.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	However, estimating losses requires significant judgment, and conditions may change or new information may become known after any periodic evaluation.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P31_S2	As a result, actual credit losses may differ from our estimates.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P31_S3	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majority-owned subsidiaries, as well as variable interest entities, or VIEs, in which we are the primary beneficiary.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P31_S4	The equity attributable to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries is shown separately in our consolidated balance sheets included elsewhere in this report.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P31_S5	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	Variable Interest Entities As required by the Consolidations Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, or Topic 810, we consolidate all VIEs in which we are the entity s primary beneficiary.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	A reporting entity is determined to be the primary beneficiary if it holds a controlling financial interest in the VIE.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P32_S2	(2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from such entity that could potentially be significant to such entity.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P32_S3	The entity which satisfies these criteria is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	We determine if an entity is a VIE based on several factors, including whether the entity s total equity investment at risk upon inception is sufficient to finance the entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P33_S1	We make judgments regarding the sufficiency of the equity at risk based first on a qualitative analysis, then a quantitative analysis, if necessary.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	We analyze any investments in VIEs to determine if we are the primary beneficiary.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	We consider a variety of factors in identifying the entity that holds the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance including, but not limited to, the ability to direct financing, leasing, construction and other operating decisions and activities.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P34_S2	In addition, we also consider the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions, to replace the manager and to sell or liquidate the entity.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P34_S3	We also have several co-investments in real estate investment funds which qualify for a deferral of the qualitative approach for analyzing potential VIEs.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P34_S4	We continue to analyze these investments under the former quantitative method incorporating various estimates, including estimated future cash flows, asset hold periods and discount rates, as well as estimates of the probabilities of various scenarios occurring.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	If the entity is a VIE, we then determine whether we consolidate the entity as the primary beneficiary.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P35_S1	This determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary includes any impact of an upside economic interest in the form of a promote that we may have.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	A promote is an interest built into the distribution structure of the entity based on the entity s achievement of certain return hurdles.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	We consolidate any VIE of which we are the primary beneficiary (see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report) and disclose significant VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary, if any, as well as disclose our maximum exposure to loss related to VIEs that are not consolidated.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	We determine whether an entity is a VIE and, if so, whether it should be consolidated by utilizing judgments and estimates that are inherently subjective.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P37_S2	If we made different judgments or utilized different estimates in these evaluations, it could result in differing conclusions as to whether or not an entity is a VIE and whether or not to consolidate such entity.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P37_S3	If an entity is not a VIE, our determination of the appropriate accounting method with respect to our investments in limited partnerships, limited liability companies and other subsidiaries is based on voting control.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P37_S4	For our general partner interests, we are presumed to control (and therefore consolidate) the entity, unless the other limited partners have substantive rights that overcome this presumption of control.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P37_S5	These substantive rights allow the limited partners to remove the general partner with or without cause or to participate in significant decisions made in the ordinary course of the entity s business.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P37_S6	We account for our non-controlling general partner investments in these entities under the equity method.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P37_S7	This treatment also applies to our managing member interests in limited liability companies.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P37_S8	Our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, but do not control, or entities which are variable interest entities in which we are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for under the equity method.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P37_S9	Accordingly, our share of the earnings from these equity-method basis companies is included in consolidated net income.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P37_S10	All other investments held on a long-term basis are valued at cost less any impairment in value.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	Our determination of the appropriate accounting treatment for an investment in a subsidiary requires judgment of several factors, including the size and nature of our ownership interest and the other owners substantive rights to make decisions for the entity.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	If we were to make different judgments or conclusions as to the level of our control or influence, it could result in a different accounting treatment.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P38_S2	Accounting for an investment as either consolidated or using the equity method generally would have no impact on our net income or stockholders equity in any accounting period, but a different treatment would impact individual income statement and balance sheet items, as consolidation would effectively gross up our income statement and balance sheet.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P38_S3	If our evaluation of an investment accounted for using the cost method was different, it could result in our being required to account for an investment by consolidation or by the equity method.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	Under the cost method, the investor does not record its share of losses of the investee.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	Conversely, under either consolidation or equity method accounting, the investor effectively records its share of the underlying entity s net income or loss, or its guarantees of the underlying entity s debt.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P39_S2	Under either the equity or cost method, impairment losses are recognized upon evidence of other-than-temporary losses of value.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	When testing for impairment on investments that are not actively traded on a public market, we generally use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our investments and/or look to comparable activities in the marketplace.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P40_S1	Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow approach.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P40_S2	These assumptions include net asset values, internal rates of return, discount and capitalization rates, interest rates and financing terms, rental rates, timing of leasing activity, estimates of lease terms and related concessions, etc.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P40_S3	When determining if impairment is other-than-temporary, we also look to the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been less than cost as well as the financial condition and near-term prospects of each investment.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting, which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P41_S1	The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	In determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, we use a variety of valuation methods including present value, depreciated replacement cost, market values (where available) and selling prices less costs to dispose.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	We are responsible for determining the valuation of assets and liabilities and for the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	Assumptions must often be made in determining fair values, particularly where observable market values do not exist.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P44_S1	Assumptions may include discount rates, growth rates, cost of capital, royalty rates, tax rates and remaining useful lives.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P44_S2	These assumptions can have a significant impact on the value of identifiable assets and accordingly can impact the value of goodwill recorded.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P44_S3	Different assumptions could result in different values being attributed to assets and liabilities.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P44_S4	Since these values impact the amount of annual depreciation and amortization expense, different assumptions could also impact our statement of operations and could impact the results of future impairment reviews.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	The majority of our goodwill balance has resulted from our acquisition of CBRE Services, Inc, or CBRE, in 2001 (the 2001 Acquisition), our acquisition of Insignia Financial Group, Inc., or Insignia, in 2003 (the Insignia Acquisition), the Trammell Crow Company Acquisition in 2006 and the REIM Acquisitions in 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P45_S1	Other intangible assets that have indefinite estimated useful lives and are not being amortized include certain management contracts identified in the REIM Acquisitions, a trademark, which was separately identified as a result of the 2001 Acquisition, and a trade name separately identified as a result of the REIM Acquisitions.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P45_S2	The remaining other intangible assets primarily include customer relationships, management contracts and loan servicing rights, which are all being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging up to 20 years.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P45_S3	We are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	The goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step process.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	The first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	We use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P47_S2	Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P47_S3	These assumptions include revenue growth rates, profit margin percentages, discount rates, etc.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered to not be impaired.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P48_S1	If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	The second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	the reporting unit as calculated in step one, over the estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P50_S1	Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business s fair value and the relative size of our goodwill, if different assumptions and estimates were used, it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	Our annual assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives has historically been completed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P51_S1	When we performed our required annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2012, 2011 and 2010, we determined that no impairment existed as the estimated fair value of our reporting units was in excess of their carrying value.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P51_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded a non-amortizable intangible asset impairment of $19.8 million in our EMEA segment related to the discontinuation of the use of a trade name in the United Kingdom.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P51_S3	Real Estate As of December 31, 2012, the carrying value of our total real estate assets was $379.2 million (4.9% of total assets).
1138118_13_ITEM7_P51_S4	The significant accounting policies and estimates with regard to our real estate assets relate to classification and impairment evaluation, cost capitalization and allocation, disposition of real estate and discontinued operations.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	Classification and Impairment Evaluation With respect to our real estate assets, the Property, Plant and Equipment, Topic of FASB ASC, or Topic 360, establishes criteria to classify an asset as held for sale.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P52_S1	Assets included in real estate held for sale consist of completed assets or land for sale in its present condition that meet all of Topic 360 s held for sale criteria.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P52_S2	All other real estate assets are classified in one of the following line items in our consolidated balance sheet: (i) real estate under development (current), which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of within one year of the balance sheet date; (ii) real estate under development (non-current), which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of more than one year from the balance sheet date; or (iii) real estate held for investment, which consists of land on which development activities have not yet commenced and completed assets or land held for disposition that do not meet the held for sale criteria.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	Real estate held for sale is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less cost to sell.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P53_S1	If an asset s fair value less cost to sell, based on discounted future cash flows, management estimates or market comparisons, is less than its carrying amount, an allowance is recorded against the asset.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P53_S2	Determining an asset s fair value and the related allowance to record requires us to utilize judgment and estimates.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	Real estate under development and real estate held for investment are carried at cost less depreciation, as applicable.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	Buildings and improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, generally up to 39 years.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P54_S2	Tenant improvements included in real estate held for investment are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the terms of the respective leases.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P54_S3	Land improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, up to 15 years.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P54_S4	When indicators of impairment are present, real estate under development and real estate held for investment are evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset are less than the asset s carrying amount.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P54_S5	The amount of the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value, which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, management estimates or market comparisons.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P54_S6	Impairment charges of $26.5 million, $1.7 million and $24.6 million were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P54_S7	In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we also recorded provisions for loss on real estate held for sale of $2.6 million and $2.3 million, respectively.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	We evaluate each of our real estate assets on a quarterly basis in order to determine the classification of each asset in our consolidated balance sheet.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P55_S1	This evaluation requires judgment by us in considering certain criteria that must be evaluated under Topic 360, such as the estimated time to complete assets that are under development and the timeframe in which we expect to sell our real estate assets.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	The classification of real estate assets determines which real estate assets are to be depreciated as well as what method is used to evaluate and measure impairment.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P56_S1	Had we evaluated our assets differently, the balance sheet classification of such assets, depreciation expense and impairment losses could have been different.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	Cost Capitalization and Allocation When acquiring, developing and constructing real estate assets, we capitalize costs.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P57_S1	Capitalization begins when we determine that activities related to development have begun and ceases when activities are substantially complete and the asset is available for occupancy, which are timing decisions that require judgment.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P57_S2	Costs capitalized include pursuit costs, or pre-acquisition/pre-construction costs, taxes and insurance, interest, development and construction costs and costs of incidental operations.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P57_S3	We do not capitalize any internal costs when acquiring, developing and constructing real estate assets.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P57_S4	We expense transaction costs for acquisitions that qualify as a business in accordance with the Business Combinations Topic of the FASB ASC, or Topic 805.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P57_S5	Pursuit costs capitalized in connection with a potential development project that we have determined based on our judgment not to pursue are written off in the period that such determination is made.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P57_S6	A difference in the timing of when this determination is made could cause the pursuit costs to be expensed in a different period.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	At times, we purchase bulk land that we intend to sell or develop in phases.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P58_S1	The land basis allocated to each phase is based on the relative estimated fair value of the phases before construction.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P58_S2	We allocate construction costs incurred relating to more than one phase between the various phases; if the costs cannot be specifically attributed to a certain phase or the improvements benefit more than one phase, we allocate the costs between the phases based on their relative estimated sales values, where practicable, or other value methods as appropriate under the circumstances.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P58_S3	Relative allocations of the costs are revised as the sales value estimates are revised.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	When acquiring real estate with existing buildings, we allocate the purchase price between land, land improvements, building and intangibles related to in-place leases, if any, based on their relative fair values.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P59_S1	The fair values of acquired land and buildings are determined based on an estimated discounted future cash flow model with lease-up assumptions as if the building was vacant upon acquisition.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P59_S2	The fair value of in-place leases includes the value of lease intangibles for above or below-market rents and tenant origination costs, determined on a lease by lease basis using assumptions for market rates, absorption periods, lease commissions and tenant improvements.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P59_S3	The capitalized values for both lease intangibles and tenant origination costs are amortized over the term of the underlying leases.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P59_S4	Amortization related to lease intangibles is recorded as either an increase to or a reduction of rental income and amortization for tenant origination costs is recorded to amortization expense.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P59_S5	If we use different estimates in these valuations, the allocation of purchase price to each component could differ, which could cause the amount of amortization related to lease intangibles and tenant origination costs, as well as depreciation of the related building and land improvements to be different.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	Disposition of Real Estate Gains on disposition of real estate are recognized upon sale of the underlying project.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P60_S1	We evaluate each real estate sale transaction to determine if it qualifies for gain recognition under the full accrual method.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P60_S2	This evaluation requires us to make judgments and estimates in assessing whether a sale has been consummated, the adequacy of the buyer s investment, the subordination or collectability of any receivable related to the purchase, and whether we have transferred the usual risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer, with no substantial continuing involvement by us.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P60_S3	If the transaction does not meet the criteria for the full accrual method of profit recognition based on our assessment, we account for the sale based on an appropriate deferral method determined by the nature and extent of the buyer s investment and our continuing involvement.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P60_S4	In some cases, a deferral method could require the real estate asset and its related liabilities to remain on our balance sheet until the sale qualifies for a different deferral method or full accrual profit recognition.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	Discontinued Operations Topic 360 extends the reporting of a discontinued operation to a component of an entity, and further requires that a component be classified as a discontinued operation if the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	As defined in Topic 360, a component of an entity comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the rest of the entity.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P62_S1	Because each of our real estate assets is generally accounted for in a discrete subsidiary, many constitute a component of an entity under Topic 360, increasing the likelihood that the disposition of assets are required to be recognized and reported as operating profits and losses on discontinued operations in the periods in which they occur.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P62_S2	The evaluation of whether the component s cash flows have been eliminated and the level of our continuing involvement require judgment by us and a different assessment could result in items not being reported as discontinued operations.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with the Accounting for Income Taxes , Topic of the FASB ASC, or Topic 740.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P64_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P64_S2	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	Accounting for tax positions requires judgments, including estimating reserves for potential uncertainties.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P66_S1	We also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P66_S2	We do not record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that we believe will be realized in future periods.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P66_S3	While we believe the resulting tax balances as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with Topic 740, as applicable, the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P66_S4	See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information regarding income taxes.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	During 2012, we identified opportunities to repatriate $191.0 million to the United States, $58.0 million in 2012 and $133.0 million in 2013, which resulted in $28.8 million of tax benefit in 2012.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P67_S1	We have not recorded a deferred tax liability for $1.1 billion of remaining undistributed earnings of subsidiaries located outside of the United States.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P67_S2	Although tax liabilities might result from the payment of dividends out of such earnings, or as a result of a sale or liquidation of non-U.S. subsidiaries, these earnings are permanently reinvested outside of the United States and we do not have any plans to repatriate these earnings or to sell or liquidate any of these non-U.S. subsidiaries.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P67_S3	To the extent that we are able to repatriate the unremitted earnings in a tax efficient manner, or in the event of a change in our capital situation or investment strategy in which such funds become needed for funding our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds, net of foreign tax credits.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	The determination of the tax liability upon repatriation is not practicable.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P68_S1	Cash and cash equivalents owned by non-U.S. subsidiaries totaled $263.4 million at December 31, 2012.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	The following table sets forth items derived from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010:
1138118_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	EBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, while amounts shown for EBITDA, as adjusted, remove the impact of certain cash and non-cash charges related to acquisitions, cost containment and asset impairments.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P70_S1	Our management believes that both of these measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculations of EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, generally eliminate the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P70_S2	Such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive programs.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P71_S1	Additionally, we believe EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, are useful to investors to assist them in getting a more complete picture of our results from operations.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P71_S2	However, EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, are not recognized measurements under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and when analyzing our operating performance, readers should use EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P71_S3	Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P71_S4	Furthermore, EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for our management s discretionary use, as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P71_S5	The amounts shown for EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P71_S6	EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted for selected charges are calculated as follows:
1138118_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2011 We reported consolidated net income of $315.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 on revenue of $6.5 billion as compared to consolidated net income of $239.2 million on revenue of $5.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P72_S1	Our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased by $608.7 million, or 10.3%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P72_S2	This increase was driven by contributions from the REIM Acquisitions (acquired in the second half of 2011) as well as higher worldwide sales transaction revenue (up 10.9%), increased commercial mortgage brokerage activity (up 31.3%) and greater outsourcing activity (up 10.1%) also contributed to the variance.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P72_S3	Worldwide leasing transaction revenue was essentially flat when compared with the prior year.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P72_S4	Foreign currency translation had a $108.2 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P72_S5	Our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by $285.4 million, or 8.3%, during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P72_S6	This increase was primarily due to higher salaries and related costs associated with our global property and facilities management contracts.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P72_S7	In addition, our sales professionals generally are paid on a commission basis, which substantially correlates with our transaction revenue performance.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P72_S8	Accordingly, the increase in sales transaction revenue led to a corresponding increase in commission expense.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P72_S9	Foreign currency translation had a $58.2 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended December 31, 2012.

1138118_13_ITEM7_P72_S18	This increase was primarily attributable to higher amortization expense relative to intangibles acquired in the REIM Acquisitions.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P72_S19	Higher depreciation expense in our Americas segment also contributed to the increase.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P72_S20	Our non-amortizable intangible asset impairment on a consolidated basis was $19.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.

1138118_13_ITEM7_P72_S23	These gains resulted from activity within our Development Services and Global Investment Management segments.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P72_S24	Our equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis decreased by $44.0 million, or 42.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P72_S25	This decrease was primarily driven by higher equity earnings associated with gains on property sales within our Development Services segment in the prior year, which did not occur to the same extent in the current year.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	Our other income on a consolidated basis was $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.

1138118_13_ITEM7_P74_S2	Our consolidated interest income decreased by $1.8 million, or 19.1%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P74_S3	This decrease was mainly driven by lower interest income reported in our Americas segment in the current year.

1138118_13_ITEM7_P74_S5	The increase was primarily due to higher interest expense attributable to additional borrowings made to finance the REIM Acquisitions in the second and third quarters of 2011 and the British pound sterling A-1 term loan facility entered into in the fourth quarter of 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P74_S6	Our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was $185.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to $189.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.

1138118_13_ITEM7_P74_S8	The decreases in our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate were primarily the result of non-deductible acquisition costs incurred in 2011 that did not recur in 2012 and the current year benefit from previously unavailable foreign income tax credits that can be utilized to offset U.S. federal income taxes on foreign-sourced earnings, partially offset by an increase in valuation allowance, tax expense on dividends and unremitted earnings and an increase in our mix of domestic to foreign earnings.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P74_S9	Our consolidated income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, was $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $49.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.

1138118_13_ITEM7_P74_S20	Accordingly, the increase in transaction revenue led to a corresponding increase in commission expense.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P74_S21	Higher salaries and related costs associated with our global property and facilities management contracts also contributed to the increase in cost of services in 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	included in cost of services for the year ended December 31, 2011, were cost containment expenses of $20.0 million relating to severance costs incurred to calibrate our staffing levels to the market environment.

1138118_13_ITEM7_P75_S21	The decrease was primarily due to lower interest expense associated with our credit agreement due to debt repayments made in the second half of 2010 and lower interest rates resulting from our refinancing activities in the fourth quarter of 2010.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P75_S22	The lower interest expense more than offset the increase in interest expense attributable to additional borrowings made to finance the REIM Acquisitions and the British pound sterling A-1 term loan facility entered into in 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P75_S23	This overall net decrease was also partially offset by interest expense incurred related to the $350.0 million of 6.625% senior notes issued on October 8, 2010.

1138118_13_ITEM7_P81_S10	Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenue increased $6.6 million driven by higher outsourcing and sales revenue, partially offset by lower leasing activity market-wide.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P81_S11	Revenue grew modestly in the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, but this was offset by reduced revenue in other countries in the region, most notably in France, which had a particularly strong prior year.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P81_S12	Cost of services decreased by $13.9 million, or 2.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011.

1138118_13_ITEM7_P81_S16	Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $7.4 million, or 2.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to higher cost containment expenses incurred in the current year and increased costs, including payroll-related and occupancy costs, partly stemming from in-fill acquisitions made in mid to late 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P81_S17	These costs were largely offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $17.0 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2012.

1138118_13_ITEM7_P82_S5	These increases were partially offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $14.4 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended December 31, 2012 as well as lower commission expense attributable to the decrease in sales transaction revenue.

1138118_13_ITEM7_P82_S8	The increase was partially due to higher legal fees incurred in 2012, increased costs stemming from an in-fill acquisition completed in Australia as well as investments in China.

1138118_13_ITEM7_P82_S13	This increase was primarily driven by an increase in costs attributable to the REIM Acquisition and a $9.3 million impairment charge on a real estate asset incurred in the current year.

1138118_13_ITEM7_P82_S17	Operating, administrative and other expenses decreased by $4.9 million, or 4.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P82_S18	This decrease was primarily driven by lower bonus expense partially due to higher gains on property sales in the prior year as well as lower property operating expenses as a result of the property dispositions noted above in this segment s revenue discussion.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P82_S19	These decreases were mostly offset by higher impairment charges related to real estate assets incurred in the current year.

1138118_13_ITEM7_P84_S1	This improvement was primarily driven by higher sales, leasing and outsourcing activity as well as increased commercial mortgage brokerage revenue.

1138118_13_ITEM7_P84_S4	Higher salaries and related costs associated with our property and facilities management contracts also contributed to an increase in cost of services in 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P84_S5	Additionally, included in cost of services for the year ended December 31, 2011, were cost containment expenses of $8.1 million relating to severance costs incurred to calibrate our staffing levels to the market environment.

1138118_13_ITEM7_P84_S8	Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $77.3 million, or 9.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P84_S9	The increase was primarily driven by higher payroll-related costs, which resulted from increased headcount and improved operating performance.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P84_S10	Also contributing to the increase in 2011 were increased legal accruals as well as higher marketing and travel costs in support of our growing revenue.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P84_S11	Foreign currency translation had a $5.8 million negative impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P85_S0	EMEA Revenue increased by $140.0 million, or 14.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, driven by higher outsourcing activities throughout the region, and increased leasing activity, led by France, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

1138118_13_ITEM7_P85_S3	Also contributing to the increase was higher costs related to increased headcount resulting from select hiring in 2010 and early 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P85_S4	Additionally, included in cost of services for the year ended December 31, 2011, were cost containment expenses of $8.7 million relating to severance costs incurred in the fourth quarter of 2011 to calibrate our staffing levels to the market environment.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P85_S5	Foreign currency translation had a $32.3 million negative impact on cost of services during the year ended December 31, 2011.

1138118_13_ITEM7_P85_S7	Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $48.7 million, or 16.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, driven by higher payroll-related costs largely resulting from additions to headcount and higher marketing and travel costs in support of our growing revenue in 2011.

1138118_13_ITEM7_P87_S0	Foreign currency translation had a $61.6 million positive impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P87_S1	Cost of services increased by $93.4 million, or 23.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, driven by higher salaries and related costs associated with our property and facilities management contracts, increases in headcount throughout the region and higher commission expense resulting from increased transaction revenue.

1138118_13_ITEM7_P87_S5	This increase was primarily due to foreign currency translation, which had an $18.0 million negative impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P87_S6	This increase was partially offset by lower legal fees incurred in 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P88_S0	Global Investment Management Revenue increased by $74.4 million, or 34.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P88_S1	This was largely driven by increased revenue of $84.6 million as a result of the REIM Acquisitions and higher incentive fees in 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P88_S2	These increases were partially offset by lower carried interest revenue of $18.3 million.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P88_S3	Foreign currency translation had a $3.7 million positive impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2011.

1138118_13_ITEM7_P88_S5	This increase was primarily driven by an increase in costs attributable to the REIM Acquisitions, including transaction and integration costs.

1138118_13_ITEM7_P89_S2	Development Services Revenue was relatively consistent at $76.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 versus $75.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, with higher project management and incentive fees mostly offset by lower rental revenue as a result of property dispositions.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P89_S3	Operating, administrative and other expenses decreased by $1.1 million, or 1.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P89_S4	Higher bonuses largely stemming from property sales in 2011 were more than offset by lower impairment charges related to real estate assets and notes receivable incurred in 2011 as well as lower property operating expenses as a result of the property dispositions noted above.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P90_S0	As of December 31, 2011, development projects in process totaled $4.9 billion and the inventory of pipeline deals totaled $1.2 billion, both unchanged from year-end 2010.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P91_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that we can satisfy our working capital requirements and funding of investments with internally generated cash flow and, as necessary, borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P91_S1	Our expected capital requirements for 2013 include up to approximately $160 million of anticipated net capital expenditures.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P92_S0	December 31, 2012, we had aggregate commitments of $31.7 million to fund future co-investments in our Global Investment Management business, $27.9 million of which is expected to be funded in 2013.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P92_S1	Additionally, as of December 31, 2012, we had committed to fund $14.3 million of additional capital to unconsolidated subsidiaries within our Development Services business, which we may be required to fund at any time.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P93_S0	In recent years, the global credit markets have experienced unprecedented tightening, which could affect both the availability and cost of our funding sources in the future.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P94_S0	In 2011, we acquired the majority of the real estate investment management business of Netherlands-based ING.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P94_S1	The acquisitions included substantially all of the ING REIM operations in Europe and Asia, as well as substantially all of CRES, its U.S.-based global real estate listed securities business, as well as certain CRES co-investments from ING and additional interests in other funds managed by ING REIM Europe and ING REIM Asia.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P94_S2	On July 1, 2011, we acquired CRES for $332.8 million and CRES co-investments from ING for an aggregate amount of $58.6 million, using borrowings from our tranche D term loan facility under our credit agreement to finance these transactions.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P94_S3	On October 3, 2011, we acquired ING REIM s operations in Asia for $45.3 million and three ING REIM Asia co-investments from ING for an aggregate amount of $13.9 million, using borrowings from our tranche C term loan facility under our credit agreement to finance these transactions.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P94_S4	On October 31, 2011, we completed the ING REIM Europe portion of the REIM Acquisitions, acquiring ING REIM s operations in Europe for $441.5 million and one co-investment from ING for $7.4 million, using borrowings from our tranche C term loan facility under our credit agreement, cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to finance these transactions.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P94_S5	During the year ended December 31, 2012, we also funded nine additional co-investments for an aggregate amount of $34.5 million related to ING REIM Europe.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P95_S0	During 2003 and 2006, we required substantial amounts of equity and debt financing to fund our acquisitions of Insignia and Trammell Crow Company.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P95_S1	We also conducted two debt offerings in recent years.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P95_S2	The first, in 2009, was part of a capital restructuring in response to the global economic recession, and the second, in 2010, was to take advantage of low interest rates and term availability.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P95_S3	Absent extraordinary transactions such as these and the equity offerings we completed during the unprecedented global capital markets disruption in 2008 and 2009, we historically have not sought external sources of financing and have relied on our internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital, capital expenditure and investment requirements.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P95_S4	In the absence of such extraordinary events, we anticipate that our cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future, but at a minimum for the next 12 months.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P96_S0	From time to time, we may seek to take advantage of market opportunities to refinance existing debt securities with new debt securities at lower interest rates, longer maturities or better terms.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P97_S0	As evidenced above, from time to time we consider potential strategic acquisitions.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P97_S1	We believe that any future significant acquisitions that we may make most likely would require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P97_S2	In the past, we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that we believed to be reasonable.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P97_S3	However, it is possible that we may not be able to find acquisition financing on favorable terms, or at all, in the future if we decide to make any further material acquisitions.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P98_S0	Our long-term liquidity needs, other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases, generally are comprised of three elements.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P99_S0	The first is the repayment of the outstanding and anticipated principal amounts of our long-term indebtedness.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P99_S1	We are unable to project with certainty whether our long-term cash flow from operations will be sufficient to repay our long-term debt when it comes due.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P99_S2	If our cash flow is insufficient, then we expect that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P99_S3	We cannot make any assurances that such refinancing or amendments would be available on attractive terms, if at all.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P100_S0	The second long-term liquidity need is the repayment of obligations under our pension plans in the United Kingdom.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P101_S0	to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in the plans.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P101_S1	With respect to these plans, our historical policy has been to contribute annually, an amount to fund pension cost as actuarially determined and as required by applicable laws and regulations.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P101_S2	Our contributions to these plans are invested and, if these investments do not perform in the future as well as we expect, we will be required to provide additional funding to cover any shortfall.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P101_S3	During 2007, we reached agreements with the active members of these plans to freeze future pension plan benefits.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P101_S4	In return, the active members became eligible to enroll in the CBRE Group Personal Pension plan, a defined contribution plan in the United Kingdom.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P101_S5	The underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans included in pension liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report was $63.5 million and $60.9 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P101_S6	We expect to contribute a total of $5.5 million to fund our pension plans for the year ending December 31, 2013.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P102_S0	The third long-term liquidity need is the payment of obligations related to acquisitions.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P102_S1	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had $14.7 million and $12.1 million, respectively, of deferred purchase consideration outstanding included in accounts payable and other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P102_S2	Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $291.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $70.1 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P102_S3	The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in the current year was primarily due to higher bonuses, commissions and income taxes paid and activities associated with securities acquired in our acquisition of CRES.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P102_S4	In addition, increases in receivables and real estate held for sale and under development in the current year as well as higher tenant concessions received in the prior year also contributed to the variance.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P102_S5	These items were partially offset by improved operating performance and an increase in accounts payable in the current year.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P102_S6	Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $361.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $255.4 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P102_S7	The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2011 was primarily due to higher bonuses, commissions and income taxes paid in 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P102_S8	These items were partially offset by an increase in bonus accruals in 2011, activity associated with securities acquired in our acquisition of CRES, a greater decrease in real estate held for sale and under development in 2011 and a greater increase in receivables in 2010.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P103_S0	Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $197.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $282.6 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P103_S1	The decrease in cash used in investing activities in the current year was primarily driven by a greater amount of cash paid for the REIM Acquisitions in the prior year.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P103_S2	This was partially offset by higher net proceeds received from the disposition of real estate held for investment in the prior year, a decrease in cash as a result of the deconsolidation of CBRE Clarion U.S., L.P. in the current year and higher distributions from investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in the prior year.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P103_S3	Net cash used in investing activities totaled $480.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $417.8 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P103_S4	The increase was primarily driven by cash paid for the REIM Acquisitions and higher capital expenditures in 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P103_S5	These increases were partially offset by net proceeds received from the disposition of real estate held for investment and higher distributions received from investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P103_S6	Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $100.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 versus net cash provided by financing activities of $711.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P104_S0	cash used in financing activities was primarily due to $800.0 million of tranche C and D term loan facilities drawn in the prior year to finance the REIM Acquisitions and proceeds from the British pound sterling A-1 term loan facility received in the prior year.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P104_S1	This was partially offset by higher net repayments of notes payable on real estate in the prior year, greater distributions to non-controlling interests in the prior year as well as more financing costs paid in the prior year.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P104_S2	Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $711.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $784.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P104_S3	The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to net proceeds from senior secured loans in 2011 to finance the REIM Acquisitions and the new British pound sterling A-1 term loan facility entered into in 2011 versus significant net repayments of our senior secured term loans in 2010.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P104_S4	These items were partially offset by higher net repayments of notes payable on real estate within our Development Services segment and greater distributions to non-controlling interests in 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P104_S5	The following is a summary of our various contractual obligations and other commitments as of December 31, 2012:
1138118_13_ITEM7_P105_S0	(1) See Note 13 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P105_S1	Figures do not include scheduled interest payments.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P105_S2	Assuming each debt obligation is held until maturity, we estimate that we will make the following interest payments (dollars in thousands): 2013 $129,785; 2014 to 2015 $248,529; 2016 to 2017 $188,847 and thereafter $105,220.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P105_S3	The interest payments on the variable rate debt have been calculated at the interest rate in effect at December 31, 2012.

1138118_13_ITEM7_P107_S0	(3) See Note 15 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P108_S0	(4) Because these obligations are related, either wholly or partially, to the future retirement of our employees and such retirement dates are not predictable, an undeterminable portion of this amount will be paid in years one through five.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P109_S0	(5) See Note 12 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P109_S1	Figures do not include scheduled interest payments.

1138118_13_ITEM7_P116_S1	In addition, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or for other purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P116_S2	If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our debt, would increase.

1138118_13_ITEM7_P139_S4	Additionally, we had $1.0 billion and $720.1 million of mortgage loans held for sale (warehouse receivables), as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, which substantially represented mortgage loans funded through the lines of credit that, while committed to be purchased, had not yet been purchased and which are also included in the consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P140_S0	Pension Liability Our subsidiaries based in the United Kingdom maintain two contributory defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in the plans.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P140_S1	The underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans included in pension liability in the consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report was $63.5 million and $60.9 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P140_S2	We expect to contribute a total of $5.5 million to fund our pension plans for the year ending December 31, 2013.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P140_S3	We had outstanding letters of credit totaling $18.8 million as of December 31, 2012, excluding letters of credit for which we have outstanding liabilities already accrued on our consolidated balance sheet related to our subsidiaries outstanding reserves for claims under certain insurance programs as well as letters of credit related to operating leases.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P140_S4	These letters of credit are primarily executed by us in the ordinary course of business and expire at varying dates through December 2013.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P140_S5	We had guarantees totaling $27.2 million as of December 31, 2012, excluding guarantees related to pension liabilities, consolidated indebtedness and other obligations for which we have outstanding liabilities already accrued on our consolidated balance sheet, and operating leases.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P140_S6	The $27.2 million primarily consists of guarantees related to our defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom (in excess of our outstanding pension liability of $63.5 million as of December 31, 2012), which are continuous guarantees that will not expire until all amounts have been paid out for our pension liabilities.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P140_S7	The remainder of the guarantees mainly represents guarantees of obligations of unconsolidated subsidiaries, which expire at varying dates through August 2015, as well as various guarantees of management contracts in our operations overseas, which expire at the end of each of the respective agreements.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P140_S8	In addition, as of December 31, 2012, we had numerous completion and budget guarantees relating to development projects.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P140_S9	These guarantees are made by us in the ordinary course of our Development Services business.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P140_S10	Each of these guarantees requires us to complete construction of the relevant project within a specified timeframe and/or within a specified budget, with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P140_S11	However, we generally have guaranteed maximum price contracts with reputable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P140_S12	These contracts are intended to pass the risk to such contractors.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P140_S13	While there can be no assurance, we do not expect to incur any material losses under these guarantees.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P141_S0	In January 2008, CBRE Multifamily Capital, Inc., or CBRE MCI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBRE Capital Markets, Inc., entered into an agreement with Fannie Mae, under Fannie Mae s Delegated Underwriting and Servicing Lender Program, or DUS Program, to provide financing for multifamily housing with five or more units.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P141_S1	Under the DUS Program, CBRE MCI originates, underwrites, closes and services loans without prior approval by Fannie Mae, and in selected cases, is subject to sharing up to one-third of any losses on loans originated under the DUS Program.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P141_S2	CBRE MCI has funded loans subject to such loss sharing arrangements with unpaid principal balances of $5.8 billion at December 31, 2012.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P141_S3	Additionally, CBRE MCI has funded loans under the DUS Program that are not subject to loss sharing arrangements with unpaid principal balances of approximately $492.6 million at December 31, 2012.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P142_S0	CBRE MCI, under its agreement with Fannie Mae, must post cash reserves under formulas established by Fannie Mae to provide for sufficient capital in the event losses occur.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P142_S1	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, CBRE MCI had $9.1 million and $4.6 million, respectively, of cash deposited under this reserve arrangement, and had provided approximately $10.6 million and $6.4 million, respectively, of loan loss accruals.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P142_S2	Fannie Mae s recourse under the DUS Program is limited to the assets of CBRE MCI, which totaled approximately $553.2 million (including $446.5 million of warehouse receivables, a substantial majority of which are pledged against warehouse lines of credit and are therefore not available to Fannie Mae) at December 31, 2012.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P143_S0	An important part of the strategy for our Global Investment Management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P144_S0	5.0% of the equity in a particular fund.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P144_S1	As of December 31, 2012, we had aggregate commitments of $31.7 million to fund future co-investments, $27.9 million of which is expected to be funded in 2013.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P144_S2	In addition to required future capital contributions, some of the co-investment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets and the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P144_S3	Additionally, an important part of our Development Services business strategy is to invest in unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries as a principal (in most cases co-investing with our clients).
1138118_13_ITEM7_P144_S4	As of December 31, 2012, we had committed to fund $14.3 million of additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries, which may be called at any time.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P145_S0	Seasonality A significant portion of our revenue is seasonal, which can affect an investor s ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P145_S1	Historically, this seasonality has caused our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P145_S2	Earnings and cash flow have historically been particularly concentrated in the fourth quarter due to investors and companies focusing on completing transactions prior to calendar year-end.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P145_S3	This has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first quarter, with revenue and profitability improving in each subsequent quarter.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P146_S0	Inflation Our commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by real estate market supply and demand, which may be affected by general economic conditions including inflation.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P146_S1	However, to date, we do not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon our operations.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P147_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2011-10, Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Derecognition of in Substance Real Estate a Scope Clarification.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P147_S1	This ASU requires that a reporting entity that ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary that is in substance real estate as a result of default on the subsidiary s nonrecourse debt would apply FASB ASC Subtopic 360-20, Property, Plant, and Equipment Real Estate Sales , to determine whether to derecognize assets and liabilities of that subsidiary.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P148_S0	ASU 2011-10 is effective prospectively for a deconsolidation event that takes place in fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after June 15, 2012.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P148_S1	We do not believe the adoption of this update will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P149_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P149_S1	This ASU adds certain additional disclosure requirements about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are subject to netting arrangements.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P149_S2	In January 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-01, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities, which clarifies that ordinary trade receivables and receivables in general are not in the scope of ASU 2011-11.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P149_S3	Both ASU 2011-11 and ASU 2013-01 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after January 1, 2013, with retrospective application required.
1138118_13_ITEM7_P149_S4	We do not believe the adoption of these updates will have a material impact on the disclosure requirements for our consolidated financial statements.
1138118_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations and changes in interest rates on debt obligations.
1138118_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We manage such risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of our debt funding and by using derivative financial instruments.
1138118_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We apply the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) (Topic 815) when accounting for derivative financial instruments.
1138118_13_ITEM7A_P1_S1	In all cases, we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and, accordingly, do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
1138118_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Exchange Rates During the year ended December 31, 2012, approximately 40% of our business was transacted in local currencies of foreign countries, the majority of which includes the Euro, the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar, the Chinese yuan, the Hong Kong dollar, the Japanese yen, the Singapore dollar, the Australian dollar and the Indian rupee.
1138118_13_ITEM7A_P2_S1	We attempt to manage our exposure primarily by balancing assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions in foreign currencies only at levels necessary for operating purposes.
1138118_13_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported amounts of our total assets and liabilities, which are reflected in our financial statements as translated into U.S. dollars for each financial reporting period at the exchange rate in effect on the respective balance sheet dates, and our total revenue and expenses, which are reflected in our financial statements as translated into U.S. dollars for each financial reporting period at the monthly average exchange rate.
1138118_13_ITEM7A_P2_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2012, foreign currency translation had a $108.2 million negative impact on our total revenue and a $97.9 million positive impact on our total costs of services and operating, administrative and other expenses.
1138118_13_ITEM7A_P2_S4	We routinely monitor our exposure to currency exchange rate changes in connection with transactions and sometimes enter into foreign currency exchange option and forward contracts to limit our exposure to such transactions, as appropriate.
1138118_13_ITEM7A_P2_S5	In the normal course of business, we also sometimes utilize derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange exposure resulting from intercompany loans, expected cash flow and earnings.
1138118_13_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Included in the consolidated statement of operations set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report were charges of $4.4 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, resulting from net losses on foreign currency exchange option agreements.
1138118_13_ITEM7A_P3_S1	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we did not have any foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding.
1138118_13_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Interest Rates We manage our interest expense by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt.
1138118_13_ITEM7A_P4_S1	Excluding notes payable on real estate, our fixed and variable rate long-term debt at December 31, 2012 consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_13_ITEM7A_P5_S0	(1) Consists of amounts due under our senior secured term loan facilities.
1138118_13_ITEM7A_P6_S0	We utilize sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect of our variable rate debt.
1138118_13_ITEM7A_P6_S1	If interest rates were to increase by 10.0% on our outstanding variable rate debt, excluding notes payable on real estate, at December 31, 2012, the net impact of the additional interest cost would be a decrease of $7.9 million on pre-tax income and a decrease of $7.9 million on cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_13_ITEM7A_P6_S2	Based upon information from third-party banks, the estimated fair value of our senior secured term loans was approximately $1.6 billion at December 31, 2012.
1138118_13_ITEM7A_P6_S3	Based on dealers quotes, the estimated fair values of our 6.625% senior notes and 11.625% senior subordinated notes were $385.0 million and $488.8 million, respectively, at December 31, 2012.
1138118_13_ITEM7A_P7_S0	In March 2011, we entered into five interest rate swap agreements, all with effective dates in October 2011, and immediately designated them as cash flow hedges in accordance with Topic 815.
1138118_13_ITEM7A_P7_S1	The purpose of these interest rate swap agreements is to hedge potential changes to our cash flows due to the variable interest nature of our senior secured term loan facilities.
1138118_13_ITEM7A_P7_S2	The total notional amount of these interest rate swap agreements is $400.0 million, with $200.0 million expiring in October 2017 and $200.0 million expiring in September 2019.
1138118_13_ITEM7A_P7_S3	There was no hedge ineffectiveness for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM7A_P7_S4	As of December 31, 2012, the fair values of these interest rate swap agreements were reflected as a $48.0 million liability and were included in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_13_ITEM7A_P7_S5	We also have $326.0 million of notes payable on real estate as of December 31, 2012.
1138118_13_ITEM7A_P7_S6	These notes have interest rates ranging from 2.46% to 8.75% with maturity dates extending through 2023.
1138118_13_ITEM7A_P7_S7	Interest costs relating to notes payable on real estate include both interest that is expensed and interest that is capitalized as part of the cost of real estate.
1138118_13_ITEM7A_P7_S8	If interest rates were to increase by 10.0%, our total estimated interest cost related to notes payable would increase by approximately $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_13_ITEM7A_P8_S0	From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap and cap agreements in order to limit our interest expense related to our notes payable on real estate.
1138118_13_ITEM7A_P8_S1	If any of these agreements are not designated as effective hedges, then they are marked to market each period with the change in fair value recognized in current period earnings.
1138118_13_ITEM7A_P9_S0	The net impact on our earnings resulting from gains and/or losses on interest rate swap and cap agreements associated with notes payable on real estate has not been significant.
1138118_13_ITEM7A_P10_S0	We also enter into loan commitments that relate to the origination or acquisition of commercial mortgage loans that will be held for resale.
1138118_13_ITEM7A_P10_S1	Topic 815 requires that these commitments be recorded at their fair values as derivatives.
1138118_13_ITEM7A_P10_S2	The net impact on our financial position and earnings resulting from these derivatives contracts has not been significant.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P0_S0	AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES All other schedules are omitted because they are either not applicable, not required or the information required is included in the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes thereto.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P1_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders CBRE Group, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CBRE Group, Inc. (the Company) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P1_S1	In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the related financial statement schedules.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P1_S2	We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1138118_13_ITEM8_P1_S3	The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting .
1138118_13_ITEM8_P1_S4	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P1_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1138118_13_ITEM8_P1_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P1_S7	Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P1_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P1_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P1_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P2_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P2_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P2_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P2_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of CBRE Group, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P4_S0	present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

1138118_13_ITEM8_P9_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P10_S0	Nature of Operations CBRE Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (which may be referred to in these financial statements as the company , we , us and our ), was incorporated on February 20, 2001.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P10_S1	We are the world s largest commercial real estate services and investment firm, based on 2012 revenue, with leading full-service operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P10_S2	We offer a full range of services to occupiers, owners, lenders and investors in office, retail, industrial, multifamily and other types of commercial real estate.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P10_S3	As of December 31, 2012, excluding independent affiliates, we operated in more than 300 offices worldwide, with approximately 37,000 employees providing commercial real estate services under the CBRE brand name, investment management services under the CBRE Global Investors brand name and development services under the Trammell Crow brand name.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P10_S4	Our business is focused on several competencies, including commercial property and corporate facilities management, occupier and property/agency leasing, property sales, real estate investment management, valuation, commercial mortgage origination and servicing, capital markets (equity and debt) solutions, development services and proprietary research.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P10_S5	We generate revenue from management fees on a contractual and per-project basis, and from commissions on transactions.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P10_S6	Our contractual, fee-for-services businesses, which generally involve facilities management, property management, mortgage loan servicing and investment management, represented approximately 41% of our 2012 revenue.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P11_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majority-owned subsidiaries, as well as variable interest entities (VIEs) in which we are the primary beneficiary and other subsidiaries of which we have control.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P11_S1	The equity attributable to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries is shown separately in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P11_S2	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P12_S0	Variable Interest Entities As required by the Consolidations Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) (Topic 810), we consolidate all VIEs in which we are the entity s primary beneficiary.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P12_S1	A reporting entity is determined to be the primary beneficiary if it holds a controlling financial interest in the VIE.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P12_S2	(2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from such entity that could potentially be significant to such entity.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P12_S3	The entity which satisfies these criteria is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P13_S0	We determine if an entity is a VIE based on several factors, including whether the entity s total equity investment at risk upon inception is sufficient to finance the entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P13_S1	We make judgments regarding the sufficiency of the equity at risk based first on a qualitative analysis, then a quantitative analysis, if necessary.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P14_S0	We analyze any investments in VIEs to determine if we are the primary beneficiary.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P14_S1	We consider a variety of factors in identifying the entity that holds the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance including, but not limited to, the ability to direct financing, leasing, construction and other operating decisions and activities.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P14_S2	In addition, we also consider the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions, to replace the manager and to sell or liquidate the entity.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P15_S0	We also have several co-investments in real estate investment funds which qualify for a deferral of the qualitative approach for analyzing potential VIEs.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P15_S1	We continue to analyze these investments under the former quantitative method incorporating various estimates, including estimated future cash flows, asset hold periods and discount rates, as well as estimates of the probabilities of various scenarios occurring.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P16_S0	If the entity is a VIE, we then determine whether we consolidate the entity as the primary beneficiary.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P16_S1	This determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary includes any impact of an upside economic interest in the form of a promote that we may have.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P17_S0	A promote is an interest built into the distribution structure of the entity based on the entity s achievement of certain return hurdles.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P18_S0	We consolidate any VIE of which we are the primary beneficiary (see Note 4) and disclose significant VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary, if any, as well as disclose our maximum exposure to loss related to VIEs that are not consolidated.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P18_S1	We determine whether an entity is a VIE and, if so, whether it should be consolidated by utilizing judgments and estimates that are inherently subjective.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P18_S2	If we made different judgments or utilized different estimates in these evaluations, it could result in differing conclusions as to whether or not an entity is a VIE and whether or not to consolidate such entity.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P18_S3	If an entity is not a VIE, our determination of the appropriate accounting method with respect to our investments in limited partnerships, limited liability companies and other subsidiaries is based on voting control.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P18_S4	For our general partner interests, we are presumed to control (and therefore consolidate) the entity, unless the other limited partners have substantive rights that overcome this presumption of control.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P18_S5	These substantive rights allow the limited partners to remove the general partner with or without cause or to participate in significant decisions made in the ordinary course of the entity s business.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P18_S6	We account for our non-controlling general partner investments in these entities under the equity method.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P18_S7	This treatment also applies to our managing member interests in limited liability companies.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P18_S8	Our determination of the appropriate accounting method for all other investments in subsidiaries is based on the amount of influence we have (including our ownership interest) in the underlying entity.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P18_S9	Those other investments where we have the ability to exercise significant influence (but not control) over operating and financial policies of such subsidiaries (including certain subsidiaries where we have less than 20% ownership) are accounted for using the equity method.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P18_S10	We eliminate transactions with such equity method subsidiaries to the extent of our ownership in such subsidiaries.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P18_S11	Accordingly, our share of the earnings or losses of these equity method subsidiaries is included in consolidated net income.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P18_S12	All of our remaining investments are carried at cost.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P19_S0	Under either the equity or cost method, impairment losses are recognized upon evidence of other-than-temporary losses of value.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P20_S0	When testing for impairment on investments that are not actively traded on a public market, we generally use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our investments and/or look to comparable activities in the marketplace.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P20_S1	Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow approach.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P20_S2	These assumptions include net asset values, internal rates of return, discount and capitalization rates, interest rates and financing terms, rental rates, timing of leasing activity, estimates of lease terms and related concessions, etc.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P20_S3	When determining if impairment is other-than-temporary, we also look to the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been less than cost as well as the financial condition and near-term prospects of each investment.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P21_S0	These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses we report.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P21_S1	Such estimates include the value of goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets, accounts receivable, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, retirement and other post-employment benefits, among others.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P21_S2	These estimates and assumptions are based on management s best judgment, and are evaluated on an ongoing basis and adjusted, as needed, using historical experience and other factors, including consideration of the macroeconomic environment.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P21_S3	The after-effects of the recent global financial crisis, including highly volatile credit, equity and foreign currency markets and a slow and uneven global economic recovery, have increased the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P21_S4	As future events and their effects cannot be forecast with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P21_S5	Changes in those estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P22_S0	The fair value of our goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets is impacted by economic and capital market conditions as well as our stock price.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P22_S1	Property sales and leasing activity is affected by economic and employment growth, capital markets liquidity, credit availability and pricing, business and investor confidence, and inflation levels.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P22_S2	Adverse trends involving any or all of these factors could reduce transaction-based revenue as well as property values and sales volume.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P22_S3	Such adverse economic conditions could cause declines in the estimated future discounted cash flows expected for our reporting units.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P22_S4	A major or sustained decline in our future cash flows and/or the current economic conditions could result in additional impairment charges.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P23_S0	The recoverability of our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries has been impacted by the continuing effects of the global financial crisis.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P23_S1	This was initially evident in sharply reduced property sales activity and decreasing property values throughout 2009.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P23_S2	As liquidity subsequently improved, transaction activity has revived for the past three years from the low levels of 2008 and 2009, but has remained well below the volume experienced in 2006 and 2007.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P23_S3	Property values also have rebounded, but price appreciation has been most significant in top-tier assets and in the largest, most liquid markets.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P23_S4	The assumptions utilized in our recoverability analysis reflect our belief that the recovery from the severe downturn will continue to be slow and gradual, and that challenging market conditions could result in further write-downs, especially if heightened capital markets turmoil returns.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P24_S0	The recoverability of the carrying value of our investments in real estate is impacted by general conditions in the U.S. economy and commercial real estate market.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P24_S1	Market fundamentals in the primary property types that we develop or own weakened significantly in late 2008 and throughout 2009.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P24_S2	Falling employment levels negatively impacted office markets as companies reduced their occupancy requirements and placed space on the market for sublease.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P24_S3	Weak industrial production adversely affected warehouse and distribution markets.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P24_S4	The retail sector was negatively affected by declining consumer spending, and the resulting impact on retail sales.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P24_S5	These trends have improved, to varying degrees, over the past three years.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P24_S6	Property sales have increased steadily as investor confidence and liquidity returned to the commercial real estate market.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P24_S7	However, if conditions in the broader economy, capital markets, local, regional or global commercial real estate markets decline sharply once again, we may be required to record additional impairment charges.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P25_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents generally consist of cash and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of less than three months.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P25_S1	Included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 is cash and cash equivalents of $94.6 million and $208.1 million, respectively, from consolidated funds and other entities, which is not available for general corporate use.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P25_S2	We also manage certain cash and cash equivalents as an agent for our investment and property and facilities management clients.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P25_S3	These amounts are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets (see Note 19).
1138118_13_ITEM8_P26_S0	Restricted Cash Included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 is restricted cash of $73.7 million and $67.1 million, respectively.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P26_S1	The balances primarily include restricted cash set aside to cover funding obligations as required by contracts executed by us in the normal course of business, including escrow accounts held in our Development Services segment.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P27_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist principally of trade receivables and interest-bearing investments.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P27_S1	Users of real estate services account for a substantial portion of trade receivables and collateral is generally not required.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P27_S2	The risk associated with this concentration is limited due to the large number of users and their geographic dispersion.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P28_S0	We place substantially all of our interest-bearing investments with major financial institutions and triple-A rated money market funds and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P29_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P29_S1	Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment is computed primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging up to 15 years.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P30_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the term of their associated leases, excluding options to renew, since such leases generally do not carry prohibitive penalties for non-renewal.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P31_S0	We capitalize expenditures that materially increase the life of our assets and expense the costs of maintenance and repairs.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P31_S1	We review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P31_S2	If this review indicates that such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment is recognized in the period the changes occur and represents the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P32_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded an impairment loss related to property and equipment of $5.8 million (see Note 5 for additional information).
1138118_13_ITEM8_P32_S1	We did not recognize an impairment loss related to property and equipment in 2011 or 2010.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P33_S0	Certain costs related to the development or purchase of internal-use software are capitalized.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P33_S1	Internal computer software costs that are incurred in the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P33_S2	Direct consulting costs as well as payroll and related costs, which are incurred during the development stage of a project are generally capitalized and amortized over a three-year period (except for enterprise software development platforms, which range from five to ten years) when placed into production.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P34_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting, which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P34_S1	The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P35_S0	Other intangible assets that have indefinite estimated useful lives and are not being amortized include certain management contracts identified in the REIM Acquisitions, a trademark, which was separately identified as a result of the 2001 Acquisition, as well as a trade name separately identified as a result of the REIM Acquisitions.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P35_S1	The remaining other intangible assets primarily include customer relationships, management contracts and loan servicing rights, which are all being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging up to 20 years.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P35_S2	We are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P36_S0	The goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step process.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P37_S0	The first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P37_S1	We use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P37_S2	Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P37_S3	These assumptions include revenue growth rates, profit margin percentages, discount rates, etc.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P38_S0	If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered to not be impaired.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P38_S1	If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P39_S0	The second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P39_S1	The implied fair value of goodwill is determined similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination, by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one, over the estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P39_S2	Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business s fair value and the relative size of our goodwill, if different assumptions and estimates were used, it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P40_S0	Deferred Financing Costs Costs incurred in connection with financing activities are generally deferred and amortized over the terms of the related debt agreements ranging up to ten years.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P40_S1	Amortization of these costs is charged to interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P40_S2	Total deferred financing costs, net of accumulated amortization, included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were $42.2 million and $51.5 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P40_S3	In connection with the credit agreement we entered into on November 10, 2010, we wrote off financing costs of $16.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, including $12.1 million of credit agreement amendment fees paid in November 2010 and $4.6 million of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with our prior credit agreement.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P40_S4	In addition, in October 2010, we wrote off $1.4 million of unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with debt repayments made.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P40_S5	All of these write-offs were included in write-off of financing costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P40_S6	See Note 13 for additional information on activities associated with our debt.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P41_S0	We record commission revenue on real estate sales generally upon close of escrow or transfer of title, except when future contingencies exist.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P41_S1	Real estate commissions on leases are generally recorded in revenue when all obligations under the commission agreement are satisfied.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P42_S0	Terms and conditions of a commission agreement may include, but are not limited to, execution of a signed lease agreement and future contingencies including tenant occupancy, payment of a deposit or payment of a first month s rent (or a combination thereof).
1138118_13_ITEM8_P42_S1	As some of these conditions are outside of our control and are often not clearly defined, judgment must be exercised in determining when such required events have occurred in order to recognize revenue.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P43_S0	A typical commission agreement provides that we earn a portion of a lease commission upon the execution of the lease agreement by the tenant and landlord, with the remaining portion(s) of the lease commission earned at a later date, usually upon tenant occupancy or payment of rent.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P43_S1	The existence of any significant future contingencies results in the delay of recognition of corresponding revenue until such contingencies are satisfied.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P43_S2	For example, if we do not earn all or a portion of the lease commission until the tenant pays its first month s rent, and the lease agreement provides the tenant with a free rent period, we delay revenue recognition until rent is paid by the tenant.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P44_S0	Property management revenues are generally based upon percentages of the revenue or base rent generated by the entities managed or the square footage managed.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P44_S1	These fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related management agreements.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P45_S0	Investment management fees are based predominantly upon a percentage of the equity deployed on behalf of our limited partners.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P45_S1	Fees related to our indirect investment management programs are based upon a percentage of the fair value of those investments.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P45_S2	These fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related investment management agreements.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P46_S0	Our Global Investment Management segment earns performance-based incentive fees with regard to many of its investments.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P46_S1	Such revenue is recognized at the end of the measurement periods when the conditions of the applicable incentive fee arrangements have been satisfied and following the expiration of any potential claw back provision.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P46_S2	With many of these investments, our Global Investment Management team has participation interests in such incentive fees, which are commonly referred to as carried interest.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P46_S3	This carried interest expense is generally accrued for based upon the probability of such performance-based incentive fees being earned over the related vesting period.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P46_S4	In addition, our Global Investment Management segment also earns success-based transaction fees with regard to buying or selling properties on behalf of certain funds and separate accounts.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P46_S5	Such revenue is recognized at the completion of a successful transaction and is not subject to any claw back provision.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P47_S0	Appraisal fees are recorded after services have been rendered.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P47_S1	and we have no significant remaining obligations for performance in connection with the transaction, while loan servicing fees are recorded in revenue as monthly principal and interest payments are collected from mortgagors.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P47_S2	Other commissions, consulting fees and referral fees are recorded as revenue at the time the related services have been performed, unless significant future contingencies exist.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P48_S0	Development services and project management services generate fees from development and construction management projects.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P48_S1	Most development and construction management and project management assignments are subject to agreements that describe the calculation of fees and when we earn such fees.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P48_S2	The earnings terms of these agreements dictate when we recognize the related revenue.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P49_S0	Generally development fees are recognized based on the lower of the amount billed or the amount determined on a straight-line basis over the development period.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P50_S0	We may earn incentive fees for project management services based upon achievement of certain performance criteria as set forth in the project management services agreement.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P50_S1	We may earn incentive development fees by reaching specified time table, leasing, budget or value creation targets, as defined in the relevant development services agreement.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P50_S2	Certain incentive development fees allow us to share in the fair value of the developed real estate asset above cost.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P50_S3	This sharing creates additional revenue potential to us with no exposure to loss other than opportunity cost.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P50_S4	We recognize such fees when the specified target is attained and fees are deemed collectible.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P51_S0	We record deferred income to the extent that cash payments have been received in accordance with the terms of underlying agreements, but such amounts have not yet met the criteria for revenue recognition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P51_S1	We recognize such revenues when the appropriate criteria are met.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P52_S0	We account for certain reimbursements (primarily salaries and related charges) mainly related to our facilities and property management operations as revenue.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P52_S1	Reimbursement revenue is recognized when the underlying reimbursable costs are incurred.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P53_S0	In establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables, we make assumptions with respect to future collectability.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P53_S1	Our assumptions are based on an assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends, including the aging of receivables balances.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P53_S2	In addition to these assessments, in general, outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are more than 180 days overdue are evaluated for collectability and fully provided for if deemed uncollectible.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P54_S0	Historically, our credit losses have generally been insignificant.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P54_S1	However, estimating losses requires significant judgment, and conditions may change or new information may become known after any periodic evaluation.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P54_S2	As a result, actual credit losses may differ from our estimates.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P55_S0	Real Estate Classification and Impairment Evaluation We classify real estate in accordance with the criteria of the Property, Plant and Equipment Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 360) as follows: (i) real estate held for sale, which includes completed assets or land for sale in its present condition that meet all of Topic 360 s held for sale criteria, (ii) real estate under development (current), which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of within one year of the balance sheet date; (iii) real estate under development (non-current), which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of more than one year from the balance sheet date; or (iv) real estate held for investment, which consists of land on which development activities have not yet commenced and completed assets or land held for disposition that do not meet the held for sale criteria.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P55_S1	Any asset reclassified from real estate held for sale to real estate under development (current or non-current) or real estate held for investment is recorded individually at the lower of its fair value at the date of the reclassification or its carrying amount before it was classified as held for sale, adjusted (in the case of real estate held for investment) for any depreciation that would have been recognized had the asset been continuously classified as real estate held for investment.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P55_S2	Real estate held for sale is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P55_S3	If an asset s fair value less cost to sell, based on discounted future cash flows, management estimates or market comparisons, is less than its carrying amount, an allowance is recorded against the asset.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P55_S4	Real estate under development and real estate held for investment are carried at cost less depreciation, as applicable.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P55_S5	Buildings and improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, generally up to 39 years.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P55_S6	Tenant improvements included in real estate held for investment are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or terms of the respective leases.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P55_S7	Land improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, up to 15 years.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P55_S8	Real estate under development and real estate held for investment are evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset are less than the asset s carrying amount.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P55_S9	The amount of the impairment loss, if any, is calculated as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value, which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, management estimates or market comparisons.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P56_S0	Cost Capitalization and Allocation When acquiring, developing and constructing real estate assets, we capitalize costs.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P56_S1	Capitalization begins when the activities related to development have begun and ceases when activities are substantially complete and the asset is available for occupancy.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P56_S2	Costs capitalized include pursuit costs, or pre-acquisition/pre-construction costs, taxes and insurance, interest, development and construction costs and costs of incidental operations.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P56_S3	We do not capitalize any internal costs when acquiring, developing and constructing real estate assets.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P56_S4	We expense transaction costs for acquisitions that qualify as a business in accordance with the Business Combinations Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 805).
1138118_13_ITEM8_P56_S5	Pursuit costs capitalized in connection with a potential development project that we have determined not to pursue are written off in the period that determination is made.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P57_S0	At times, we purchase bulk land that we intend to sell or develop in phases.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P57_S1	The land basis allocated to each phase is based on the relative estimated fair value of the phases before construction.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P57_S2	We allocate construction costs incurred relating to more than one phase between the various phases; if the costs cannot be specifically attributed to a certain phase or the improvements benefit more than one phase, we allocate the costs between the phases based on their relative estimated sales values, where practicable, or other value methods as appropriate under the circumstances.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P57_S3	Relative allocations of the costs are revised as the sales value estimates are revised.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P58_S0	When acquiring real estate with existing buildings, we allocate the purchase price between land, land improvements, building and intangibles related to in-place leases, if any, based on their relative fair values.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P58_S1	The fair values of acquired land and buildings are determined based on an estimated discounted future cash flow model with lease-up assumptions as if the building was vacant upon acquisition.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P58_S2	The fair value of in-place leases includes the value of lease intangibles for above or below-market rents and tenant origination costs, determined on a lease by lease basis.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P58_S3	The capitalized values for both lease intangibles and tenant origination costs are amortized over the term of the underlying leases.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P58_S4	Amortization related to lease intangibles is recorded as either an increase to or a reduction of rental income and amortization for tenant origination costs is recorded to amortization expense.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P59_S0	Disposition of Real Estate Gains on disposition of real estate are recognized upon sale of the underlying project.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P59_S1	We evaluate each real estate sale transaction to determine if it qualifies for gain recognition under the full accrual method.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P59_S2	If the transaction does not meet the criteria for the full accrual method of profit recognition based on our assessment, we account for a sale based on an appropriate deferral method determined by the nature and extent of the buyer s investment and our continuing involvement.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P60_S0	Discontinued Operations Topic 360 extends the reporting of a discontinued operation to a component of an entity, and further requires that a component be classified as a discontinued operation if the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P61_S0	As defined in Topic 360, a component of an entity comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the rest of the entity.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P61_S1	Because each of our real estate assets is generally accounted for in a discrete subsidiary, many constitute a component of an entity under Topic 360, increasing the likelihood that the disposition of assets that we hold for sale in the ordinary course of business must be reported as a discontinued operation unless we have significant continuing involvement in the operations of the asset after its disposition.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P61_S2	Furthermore, operating profits and losses on such assets are required to be recognized and reported as operating profits and losses on discontinued operations in the periods in which they occur.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P62_S0	The costs of business promotion and advertising are expensed as incurred.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P62_S1	Business promotion and advertising costs of $43.7 million, $42.5 million and $37.5 million were included in operating, administrative and other expenses for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P63_S0	The financial statements of subsidiaries located outside the U.S. are generally measured using the local currency as the functional currency.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P63_S1	The assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date, and income and expenses are translated at the average monthly rate.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P63_S2	The resulting translation adjustments are included in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of equity.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P63_S3	Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the results of operations.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P63_S4	The aggregate transaction losses included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $3.6 million, $0.4 million and $4.0 million, respectively.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P64_S0	As required by FASB ASC Topic 815 Derivatives and Hedging , we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P64_S1	The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P65_S0	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P65_S1	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P65_S2	Derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P66_S0	Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P67_S0	We may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of our risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or we elect not to apply hedge accounting.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P67_S1	In all cases, we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and, accordingly, do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P68_S0	Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive (loss) income.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P68_S1	In the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, accumulated other comprehensive loss consists of foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized losses on interest rate swaps and interest rate caps, unrealized holding gains on available for sale securities and other pension liability adjustments.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P68_S2	Foreign currency translation adjustments exclude any income tax effect given that earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries are deemed to be reinvested for an indefinite period of time (see Note 16).
1138118_13_ITEM8_P69_S0	Marketable Securities We account for investments in marketable debt and equity securities in accordance with the Investments Debt and Equity Securities Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 320).
1138118_13_ITEM8_P69_S1	We determine the appropriate classification of debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P70_S0	Debt securities are classified as held to maturity when we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P70_S1	Marketable equity and debt securities not classified as trading or held to maturity are classified as available for sale.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P71_S0	Trading securities are carried at their fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in net income.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P71_S1	Available for sale securities are carried at their fair value and any difference between cost and fair value is recorded as unrealized gain or loss, net of income taxes, and is reported as accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated statement of equity.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P72_S0	Premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the effective interest method.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P72_S1	Realized gains and losses and declines in value expected to be other-than-temporary on available for sale securities have not been significant.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P73_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P73_S1	Interest and dividends on securities classified as available for sale are included in interest income.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P74_S0	Our wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE Capital Markets is a Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) approved Multifamily Program Plus Seller/Servicer and an approved Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) Aggregation and Negotiated Transaction Seller/Servicer.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P74_S1	In addition, CBRE Capital Markets wholly-owned subsidiary Multifamily Capital is an approved Fannie Mae Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS) Seller/Servicer and CBRE Capital Markets wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE HMF is a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) approved Non-Supervised Federal Housing Authority (FHA) Title II Mortgagee, an approved Multifamily Accelerated Processing (MAP) lender and an approved Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) issuer of mortgage-backed securities (MBS).
1138118_13_ITEM8_P75_S0	Under these arrangements, before loans are originated through proceeds from warehouse lines of credit, we obtain either a contractual loan purchase commitment from either Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae or a confirmed forward trade commitment for the issuance and purchase of a Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae MBS that will be secured by the loans.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P75_S1	The warehouse lines of credit are generally repaid within a one-month period when Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae buys the loans or upon settlement of the Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae MBS, while we retain the servicing rights.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P76_S0	Loans are funded at the prevailing market rates.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P77_S0	We elect the fair value option for all warehouse receivables.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P77_S1	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, all of the warehouse receivables included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were either under commitment to be purchased by Freddie Mac or had confirmed forward trade commitments for the issuance and purchase of Fannie Mae mortgage backed securities that will be secured by the underlying loans.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P78_S0	In connection with the origination and sale of mortgage loans with servicing rights retained, we record servicing assets or liabilities based on the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights on the date the loans are sold.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P78_S1	We also assume or purchase certain servicing assets.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P78_S2	Servicing assets are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value in other intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are amortized in proportion to and over the estimated period that net servicing income is expected to be received based on projections and timing of estimated future net cash flows.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P79_S0	Our recording of mortgage servicing rights at their fair value resulted in net gains, which have been reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P79_S1	The amount of mortgage servicing rights recognized during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_13_ITEM8_P80_S0	Mortgage servicing rights do not actively trade in an open market with readily available observable prices; therefore, fair value is determined based on certain assumptions and judgments, including the estimation of the present value of future cash flows realized from servicing the underlying mortgage loans.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P80_S1	Management s assumptions include the benefits of servicing (servicing fee income and interest on escrow deposits), inflation, the cost of servicing, prepayment rates, delinquencies, discount rate and the estimated life of servicing cash flows.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P80_S2	The assumptions used are subject to change based on management s judgments and estimates of changes in future cash flows and interest rates, among other things.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P80_S3	The key assumptions used during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 in measuring fair value were as follows:
1138118_13_ITEM8_P80_S4	The estimated fair value of our mortgage servicing rights was $165.4 million and $111.1 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P80_S5	We did not incur any impairment charges related to our servicing rights during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 or 2010.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P80_S6	Included in revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations are contractually specified servicing fees from loans serviced for others of $40.0 million, $28.2 million and $21.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively and late fees/ancillary income earned from loans serviced for others of $0.8 million, $1.5 million and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P81_S0	Accounting for Broker Draws As part of our recruitment efforts relative to new U.S. brokers, we offer a transitional broker draw arrangement.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P81_S1	Our broker draw arrangements generally last until such time as a broker s pipeline of business is sufficient to allow him or her to earn sustainable commissions.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P82_S0	This program is intended to provide the broker with a minimal amount of cash flow to allow adequate time for his or her training as well as time for him or her to develop business relationships.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P82_S1	Similar to traditional salaries, the broker draws are paid irrespective of the actual revenues generated by the broker.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P82_S2	Often these broker draws represent the only form of compensation received by the broker.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P82_S3	Furthermore, it is not our general policy to pursue collection of unearned broker draws paid under this arrangement.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P83_S0	salaries paid and accordingly charge them to compensation as incurred.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P83_S1	The broker is also entitled to earn a commission on completed revenue transactions.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P83_S2	This amount is calculated as the commission that would have been payable under our full commission program, less any amounts previously paid to the broker in the form of a draw.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P84_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We account for all employee awards under the fair value recognition provisions of the Compensation Stock Compensation Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 718).
1138118_13_ITEM8_P84_S1	Topic 718 requires the measurement of compensation cost at the grant date, based upon the estimated fair value of the award, and requires amortization of the related expense over the employee s requisite service period.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P84_S2	See Note 15 for additional information on our stock-based compensation plans.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P85_S0	Basic income per share attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. is computed by dividing net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P85_S1	The computation of diluted income per share attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. generally further assumes the dilutive effect of potential common shares, which include stock options and certain contingently issuable shares.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P85_S2	Contingently issuable shares consist of non-vested stock awards.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P86_S0	Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with the Accounting for Income Taxes Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 740).
1138118_13_ITEM8_P87_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P87_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P87_S2	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P88_S0	Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P89_S0	Self-Insurance Our wholly-owned captive insurance company, which is subject to applicable insurance rules and regulations, insures our exposure related to workers compensation insurance provided to employees and purchases excess coverage from an unrelated insurance carrier.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P89_S1	We purchase general liability and automotive insurance through an unrelated insurance carrier.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P89_S2	The captive insurance company reinsures the related deductibles.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P89_S3	The captive insurance company also insures deductibles relating to professional indemnity claims.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P89_S4	Given the nature of these types of claims, it may take several years for resolution and determination of the cost of these claims.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P89_S5	We are required to estimate the cost of these claims in our financial statements.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P89_S6	The estimates that we utilize to record our potential losses on claims are inherently subjective, and actual claims could differ from amounts recorded, which could result in increased or decreased expense in future periods.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P89_S7	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, our reserves for claims under these insurance programs were $48.4 million and $51.8 million, respectively, which were included in other current and other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P89_S8	Of these amounts, $11.9 million and $16.1 million, respectively, represented our estimated current liabilities as of December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P90_S0	Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Limited Life Subsidiaries As of December 31, 2012, the estimated settlement value of non-controlling interests in our consolidated limited life subsidiaries was $68.4 million, as compared to the carrying value of $61.7 million, which was included in non-controlling interests in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P90_S1	As of December 31, 2011, the estimated settlement value of non-controlling interests in our consolidated limited life subsidiaries approximated the carrying value of $79.3 million, which was included in non-controlling interests in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P91_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2011-10, Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Derecognition of in Substance Real Estate a Scope Clarification.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P91_S1	This ASU requires that a reporting entity that ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary that is in substance real estate as a result of default on the subsidiary s nonrecourse debt would apply FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Subtopic 360-20, Property, Plant, and Equipment Real Estate Sales, to determine whether to derecognize assets and liabilities of that subsidiary.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P92_S0	ASU 2011-10 is effective prospectively for a deconsolidation event that takes place in fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after June 15, 2012.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P92_S1	We do not believe the adoption of this update will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P93_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P93_S1	This ASU adds certain additional disclosure requirements about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are subject to netting arrangements.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P93_S2	In January 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-01, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities, which clarifies that ordinary trade receivables and receivables in general are not in the scope of ASU 2011-11.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P93_S3	Both ASU 2011-11 and ASU 2013-01 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after January 1, 2013, with retrospective application required.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P93_S4	We do not believe the adoption of these updates will have a material impact on the disclosure requirements for our consolidated financial statements.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P94_S0	In 2011, we acquired the majority of the real estate investment management business of Netherlands-based ING.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P94_S1	The acquisitions included substantially all of ING s REIM operations in Europe and Asia, as well as substantially all of CRES, its U.S.-based global real estate listed securities business (collectively referred to as ING REIM) along with certain CRES co-investments from ING and additional interests in other funds managed by ING REIM Europe and ING REIM Asia.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P94_S2	Upon completion of the acquisitions (collectively referred to as the REIM Acquisitions), ING REIM became part of our Global Investment Management segment (which conducts business through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, CBRE Global Investors, an independently operated business segment).
1138118_13_ITEM8_P94_S3	We completed the REIM Acquisitions in order to significantly enhance our ability to meet the needs of institutional investors across global markets with a full spectrum of investment programs and strategies.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P94_S4	We secured borrowings of $800.0 million of term loans to finance the REIM Acquisitions (see Note 13).
1138118_13_ITEM8_P94_S5	Of this amount, $400.0 million was drawn on June 30, 2011 to finance the CRES portion of the REIM Acquisitions, which closed on July 1, 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P95_S0	and the remainder, along with cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility, was used to finance the ING REIM Europe portion of the REIM Acquisitions, which closed on October 31, 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P95_S1	The following represents a summary of the purchase price for the REIM Acquisitions (dollars in thousands):
1138118_13_ITEM8_P95_S2	In connection with our acquisition of CRES, we acquired CRES co-investments from ING in three funds (CRES Funds) for an aggregate purchase price of $58.6 million, which has been included above.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P95_S3	We determined that the CRES Funds were not VIEs and accordingly determined the method of accounting based upon voting control.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P95_S4	The limited partners/members of the CRES Funds lack substantive rights that would overcome our presumption of control.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P95_S5	Accordingly, we began consolidating the CRES Funds as of the acquisition date of July 1, 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P95_S6	In connection with the REIM Acquisitions, we also acquired three ING REIM Asia co-investments from ING for an aggregate amount of $13.9 million on October 3, 2011 and several ING REIM Europe co-investments, including one for $7.4 million on October 31, 2011, and nine additional co-investments for an aggregate amount of $34.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P96_S0	In January 2012, one of the CRES Funds (CBRE Clarion U.S., L.P.) was converted to a registered mutual fund, the CBRE Clarion Long/Short Fund (the Fund).
1138118_13_ITEM8_P96_S1	As a result of this triggering event, we determined that the Fund became a VIE and that we were not the primary beneficiary.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P96_S2	Accordingly, in the first quarter of 2012, the Fund was deconsolidated from our consolidated financial statements and we recorded an investment in available for sale securities of $14.3 million.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P96_S3	No gain or loss was recognized in our consolidated statement of operations as a result of this deconsolidation.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P96_S4	We continue to act as the Fund s adviser, make investment decisions for the Fund and review, supervise and administer the Fund s investment program.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P96_S5	The purchase accounting for the REIM Acquisitions has been finalized.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P96_S6	The excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired has been recorded to goodwill.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P96_S7	The goodwill arising from the REIM Acquisitions consists largely of the synergies and economies of scale expected from combining the operations acquired from ING with ours.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P96_S8	Only $8.3 million of the goodwill recorded in connection with the REIM Acquisitions is deductible for tax purposes.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P96_S9	There were no significant adjustments to the purchase price allocation recorded during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P96_S10	The consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 includes revenue, operating income and net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. of $84.6 million, $15.7 million and $9.1 million, respectively, attributable to the REIM Acquisitions.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P96_S11	This does not include direct transaction and integration costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2011 of $66.7 million in connection with the REIM Acquisitions.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P96_S12	Unaudited pro forma results, assuming the REIM Acquisitions had occurred as of January 1, 2010 for purposes of the 2011 and 2010 pro forma disclosures, are presented below.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P97_S0	These unaudited pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of what operating results would have been had the REIM Acquisitions occurred on January 1, 2010 and may not be indicative of future operating results (dollars in thousands, except share data):
1138118_13_ITEM8_P98_S0	Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) A consolidated subsidiary (the Venture) in our Global Investment Management segment has sponsored investments by third-party investors in certain commercial properties through the formation of tenant-in-common limited liability companies and Delaware Statutory Trusts (collectively referred to as the Entities) that are owned by the third-party investors.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P98_S1	The Venture also has formed and is a member of a limited liability company for each property that serves as master tenant (Master Tenant).
1138118_13_ITEM8_P98_S2	Each Master Tenant leases the property from the Entities through a master lease agreement.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P98_S3	Pursuant to the master lease agreements, the Master Tenant has the power to direct the day-to-day asset management activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the Entities.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P98_S4	As a result, the Entities were deemed to be VIEs since the third-party investors holding the equity investment at risk in the Entities do not direct the day-to-day activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the properties held by the Entities.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P98_S5	The Venture has made and may continue to make voluntary contributions to each of these properties to support their operations beyond the cash flow generated by the properties themselves.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P98_S6	As of the most recent reconsideration date, such financial support has been significant enough that the Venture was deemed to be the primary beneficiary of each Entity.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P98_S7	During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Venture funded $0.2 million, $0.2 million and $1.2 million, respectively, of financial support to the Entities.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P98_S8	The Entities were initially consolidated by the Venture upon adoption of ASU 2009-17, Consolidations (Topic 810): Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved With Variable Interest Entities, on January 1, 2010.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P98_S9	The Entities assets and associated mortgage notes payable aggregated $251.0 million and $221.5 million, respectively, and were recorded based on their fair value at adoption.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P98_S10	We did not recognize a gain or loss on the initial consolidation of these Entities.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P98_S11	The assets of the Entities are the sole collateral for the mortgage notes payable and other liabilities of the Entities and as such, the creditors and equity investors of these Entities have no recourse to our assets held outside of these Entities.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P99_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2011, five of the original eight commercial properties were sold.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P99_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2012, an additional Entity was consolidated during the first quarter and subsequently sold in the fourth quarter.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P100_S0	Operating results relating to the Entities for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 include the following (dollars in thousands): Investments in real estate of $58.8 million and $61.3 million and nonrecourse mortgage notes payable of $61.7 million ($1.3 million of which is current) and $60.9 million ($1.2 million of which is current) are included in real estate assets held for investment and notes payable on real estate, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P100_S1	In addition, a non-controlling deficit of $2.7 million and non-controlling interests of $0.6 million in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, are attributable to the Entities.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P101_S0	We hold variable interests in certain VIEs in our Global Investment Management and Development Services segments which are not consolidated as it was determined that we are not the primary beneficiary.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P101_S1	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, our maximum exposure to loss related to the VIE s which are not consolidated was as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_13_ITEM8_P102_S0	The Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 820) defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P102_S1	Topic 820 also establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P102_S2	This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P102_S3	The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:
1138118_13_ITEM8_P103_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P104_S0	Level 2 Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P105_S0	Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P105_S1	This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P106_S0	There were no transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P107_S0	The following tables present the fair value of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2012 and 2011:
1138118_13_ITEM8_P108_S0	Fair value measurements for our available for sale securities are obtained from independent pricing services which utilize observable market data that may include quoted market prices, dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. treasury yield curve, trading levels, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the instrument s terms and conditions.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P109_S0	The trading securities and securities sold, not yet purchased are primarily in the U.S. and are generally valued at the last reported sales price on the day of valuation or, if no sales occurred on the valuation date, at the mean of the bid and asked prices on such date.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P109_S1	The fair values of the warehouse receivables are calculated based on already locked in security buy prices.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P109_S2	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, all of the warehouse receivables included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were either under commitment to be purchased by Freddie Mac or had confirmed forward trade commitments for the issuance and purchase of Fannie Mae mortgage backed securities that will be secured by the underlying warehouse lines of credit (See Note 2).
1138118_13_ITEM8_P109_S3	These assets are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as all inputs are readily observable.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P110_S0	The valuation of interest rate swaps is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P110_S1	This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P111_S0	The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P111_S1	The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate forward curves.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P112_S0	To comply with the provisions of Topic 820, we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P113_S0	In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we have considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P113_S1	In conjunction with our adoption of ASU 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs , we made an accounting policy election to measure the credit risk of our derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements on a net basis by counterparty portfolio.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P113_S2	Although we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by us and our counterparties.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P113_S3	However, as of December 31, 2012, we have determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P113_S4	As a result, we have determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P114_S0	The following tables are a summary of our available for sale securities (dollars in thousands):
1138118_13_ITEM8_P115_S0	The net carrying value and estimated fair value of debt securities at December 31, 2012, by contractual maturity, are shown below.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P116_S0	Actual repayment dates may differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay obligations.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P117_S0	We did not record any significant dividends or interest income related to marketable securities for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P117_S1	The portion of net gains and losses for the year ending December 31, 2012 relating to trading securities still held at December 31, 2012 is calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_13_ITEM8_P118_S0	The portion of net gains and losses for the year ending December 31, 2011 relating to trading securities still held at December 31, 2011 is calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_13_ITEM8_P119_S0	We did not hold any investments in trading securities during 2010.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P120_S0	The following non-recurring fair value measurements were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 (dollars in thousands):
1138118_13_ITEM8_P121_S0	The fair value measurements employed for our impairment evaluations were generally based on third-party information available in non active markets (such as third-party appraisals and offers received from third parties) as well as a discounted cash flow approach and/or review of comparable activities in the market place.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P121_S1	Inputs used in these evaluations included risk-free rates of return, estimated risk premiums as well as other economic variables.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P122_S0	Property and Equipment During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded an asset impairment of $5.8 million in our Americas segment.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P122_S1	This non-cash write-off resulted from the decision to abandon certain modules of a software platform that were being developed in the U.S. as a result of a change in strategy.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P122_S2	This impairment charge was included within operating, administrative and other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P122_S3	Other Intangible Assets During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded a non-amortizable intangible asset impairment of $19.8 million in our EMEA segment.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P122_S4	This non-cash write-off related to the discontinuation of the use of a trade name in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and was reflected as a separate line item in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P122_S5	Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded write-downs of $3.9 million, of which $0.6 million were attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P122_S6	During the year ended December 31, 2012, $3.8 million of the investment write-downs were reported in our Global Investment Management segment and $0.1 million were reported in our Development Services segment.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P122_S7	These write-downs were primarily driven by a decrease in the estimated holding period of certain assets and the continuation of challenging market conditions.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P122_S8	During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded write-downs of $5.6 million, of which $0.1 million were attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P122_S9	During the year ended December 31, 2011, $5.5 million of the investment write-downs were reported in our Global Investment Management segment and $0.1 million were reported in our Development Services segment.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P122_S10	These write-downs were primarily driven by a decrease in the estimated holding period of certain assets.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P122_S11	During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded write-downs of $11.8 million, of which $3.8 million were attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P122_S12	During the year ended December 31, 2010, $9.4 million of the investments write-downs were reported in our Global Investment Management segment and driven by a decrease in the estimated holding period of certain assets.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P122_S13	In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred an additional $1.2 million of impairment charges in each of our Global Investment Management and Development Services segments, all driven by a decline in value of several investments attributable to slower than expected leasing.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P123_S0	All of our impairment charges related to investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries were included in equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P123_S1	When we performed our impairment analysis, the assumptions utilized reflected our outlook for the commercial real estate industry and the expected impact on our business.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P124_S0	Real Estate During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded impairment charges of $26.5 million on real estate held for investment.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P124_S1	Of this amount, $15.9 million was attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P124_S2	These impairment charges were driven by a decrease in the estimated holding period of certain assets and the continuation of challenging market conditions.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P124_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded charges of $4.3 million, including provisions for losses on real estate held for sale and impairment charges on real estate held for investment.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P124_S4	Of this amount, $0.3 million was attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P125_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded provisions for losses on real estate held for sale of $2.6 million.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P125_S1	These charges reduced the carrying value of certain assets to their fair value, less cost to sell, primarily due to reduced selling prices resulting from a decrease in the estimated holding period of certain assets.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P125_S2	Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded impairment charges of $1.7 million related to real estate held for investment, which were attributable to continued challenging market conditions.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P125_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded charges of $26.9 million, including impairment charges on real estate held for investment and provisions for losses on real estate held for sale.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P125_S4	Of this amount, $23.8 million was attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P126_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded impairment charges of $24.6 million related to nine real estate projects primarily due to a decrease in the estimated holding period of several of the projects and continued capital market disruption.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P126_S1	Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded provisions for losses on real estate held for sale of $2.3 million to reduce the carrying values of two office buildings, an operating hotel and a land parcel to their fair value less cost to sell, primarily due to reduced expected selling prices resulting from continued challenging market conditions.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P126_S2	All of the abovementioned charges were reported in our Development Services segment, with the exception of a $9.3 million impairment charge reported in our Global Investment Management segment during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P126_S3	All of the abovementioned charges were included within operating, administrative and other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, with the exception of a $1.3 million provision for loss on real estate for the year ended December 31, 2011, which was included within activity from discontinued operations.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P127_S0	If conditions in the broader economy, commercial real estate industry, specific markets or product types in which we operate worsen, we may be required to evaluate additional projects or re-evaluate previously impaired projects for potential impairment.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P127_S1	These evaluations could result in additional impairment charges, which may be material.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P128_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2010 we recorded a $0.3 million impairment charge on a note receivable secured by real estate, due to a decrease in value of the borrower s real estate project, the proceeds from the sale of which would be used to repay the note receivable.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P129_S0	This impairment charge was included in operating, administrative and other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations within our Development Services segment.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P130_S0	FASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P130_S1	Our financial instruments, excluding those included in the preceding fair value tables above, are as follows: Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash : These balances include cash and cash equivalents as well as restricted cash with maturities of less than three months.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P130_S2	The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P131_S0	Receivables, less Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: Due to their short-term nature, fair value approximates carrying value.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P131_S1	Warehouse Receivables: These balances are carried at fair value based on market prices at the balance sheet date.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P131_S2	Trading and Available for Sale Securities: These investments are carried at their fair value.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P131_S3	Securities Sold, not yet Purchased: These liabilities are carried at their fair value.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P131_S4	Short-Term Borrowings : The majority of this balance represents our warehouse lines of credit and our revolving credit facility outstanding for CBRE Capital Markets.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P131_S5	Due to the short-term nature and variable interest rates of these instruments, fair value approximates carrying value (see Note 13).
1138118_13_ITEM8_P131_S6	Senior Secured Term Loans : Based upon information from third-party banks, the estimated fair value of our senior secured term loans was approximately $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, which approximated their actual carrying value at December 31, 2012 and 2011 (see Note 13).
1138118_13_ITEM8_P132_S0	Interest Rate Swaps : These liabilities are carried at their fair value as calculated by using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative (see Note 6).
1138118_13_ITEM8_P132_S1	11.625% Senior Subordinated Notes : Based on dealers quotes, the estimated fair value of our 11.625% senior subordinated notes was $488.8 million and $504.3 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P132_S2	Their actual carrying value totaled $440.5 million and $439.0 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively (see Note 13).
1138118_13_ITEM8_P132_S3	6.625% Senior Notes : Based on dealers quotes, the estimated fair value of our 6.625% senior notes was $385.0 million and $364.9 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P132_S4	Their actual carrying value totaled $350.0 million at both December 31, 2012 and 2011 (see Note 13).
1138118_13_ITEM8_P132_S5	Notes Payable on Real Estate: As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the carrying value of our notes payable on real estate was $326.0 million and $372.9 million, respectively (see Note 12).
1138118_13_ITEM8_P133_S0	These borrowings have mostly floating interest rates at spreads over a market rate index.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P134_S0	It is likely that some portion of our notes payable on real estate have fair values lower than actual carrying values.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P134_S1	Given our volume of notes payable and the cost involved in estimating their fair value, we determined it was not practicable to do so.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P134_S2	Additionally, only $13.9 million and $13.6 million of these notes payable were recourse to us as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P135_S0	Derivative Financial Instruments We are exposed to certain risks arising from both our business operations and economic conditions.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P135_S1	We manage economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of our debt funding and by using derivative financial instruments.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P135_S2	Specifically, we enter into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P135_S3	Our derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of our known or expected cash payments principally related to our borrowings.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P135_S4	Our objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P135_S5	To accomplish this objective, we primarily use interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P136_S0	In March 2011, we entered into five interest rate swap agreements, all with effective dates in October 2011, and immediately designated them as cash flow hedges.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P136_S1	The purpose of these interest rate swap agreements is to hedge potential changes to our cash flows due to the variable interest nature of our senior secured term loan facilities.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P136_S2	The total notional amount of these interest rate swap agreements is $400.0 million, with $200.0 million expiring in October 2017 and $200.0 million expiring in September 2019.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P137_S0	The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P137_S1	There was no hedge ineffectiveness for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P138_S0	The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the balance sheet and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P138_S1	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, there was $48.0 million and $39.9 million, respectively, included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets related to these interest rate swaps, which will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on our senior secured term loan facilities.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P138_S2	During the next twelve months, we estimate that $11.7 million will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P138_S3	The following table presents the fair value of our interest rate swaps as well as their classification on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 (dollars in thousands):
1138118_13_ITEM8_P138_S4	The following table presents the effect of our interest rate swaps on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 (dollars in thousands):
1138118_13_ITEM8_P139_S0	The following table presents the effect of our interest rate swaps on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 (dollars in thousands):
1138118_13_ITEM8_P140_S0	We have agreements with some of our derivative counterparties that contain a provision where (1) if we default on any of our indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then we could also be declared in default on our derivative obligations; or (2) we could be declared in default on our derivative obligations if repayment of the underlying indebtedness is accelerated by the lender due to our default on the indebtedness.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P140_S1	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the fair value of derivatives related to these agreements was net liability positions of $49.0 million and $40.9 million, respectively, which includes accrued interest but excludes any adjustment for nonperformance risk.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P140_S2	As of December 31, 2012, we have not posted any collateral related to these agreements.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P140_S3	Had we breached any of the provisions discussed above at December 31, 2012, we may have been required to settle our obligations under the agreements at their termination value of $51.2 million.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P141_S0	From time to time, we also enter into interest rate swap and cap agreements in order to limit our interest expense related to our notes payable on real estate.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P141_S1	If any of these agreements are not designated as effective hedges, then they are marked to market each period with the change in fair value recognized in current period earnings.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P142_S0	The net impact on our earnings resulting from gains and/or losses on interest rate swap and cap agreements associated with notes payable on real estate has not been significant.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P142_S1	We routinely monitor our exposure to currency exchange rate changes in connection with transactions and sometimes enter into foreign currency exchange swap, option and forward contracts to limit our exposure to such transactions, as appropriate.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P142_S2	In the normal course of business, we also sometimes utilize derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange exposure resulting from intercompany loans, expected cash flow and earnings.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P143_S0	Included in the consolidated statements of operations were net losses of $4.4 million, $1.5 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, resulting from net losses on foreign currency exchange swap, option and forward contracts.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P143_S1	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we did not have any foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P143_S2	We also enter into loan commitments that relate to the origination or acquisition of commercial mortgage loans that will be held for resale.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P143_S3	Topic 815 requires that these commitments be recorded at their fair values as derivatives.

1138118_13_ITEM8_P197_S12	While there can be no assurance, we do not expect to incur any material losses under these guarantees.

1138118_13_ITEM8_P211_S0	The number of shares issued or reserved pursuant to the 2012 equity incentive plan, or pursuant to outstanding awards, is subject to adjustment on account of a stock split of our outstanding shares, stock dividend, dividend payable in a form other than shares in an amount that has a material effect on the price of the shares, consolidation, combination or reclassification of the shares, recapitalization, spin-off, or other similar occurrence.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P212_S0	Stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under the 2012 equity incentive plan are subject to a maximum term of ten years from the date of grant.

1138118_13_ITEM8_P212_S3	As of December 31, 2012, 16,393,350 shares remained available for future grants under this plan.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P212_S4	As of December 31, 2012, no shares were subject to options issued under our 2012 equity incentive plan.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P212_S5	No options were granted during the year ended December 31, 2012.

1138118_13_ITEM8_P212_S7	All options that have been granted under the 2004 stock incentive plan have a term of five or seven years from the date of grant.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P213_S0	A summary of the status of our outstanding stock options is presented in the tables below:
1138118_13_ITEM8_P214_S0	(1) The expected to vest options are the result of applying the pre-vesting forfeiture rate assumption to total outstanding options.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P215_S0	We estimate the fair value of our options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which takes into account assumptions such as the dividend yield, the risk-free interest rate, the expected stock price volatility and the expected life of the options.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P215_S1	The total estimated grant date fair value of stock options that vested during the year ended December 31, 2012 was $3.1 million.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P215_S2	The weighted average fair value of options granted by us was $13.49 and $10.40 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P216_S0	The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, utilizing the following weighted average assumptions: The dividend yield assumption is excluded from the calculation, as it is our present intention to retain all earnings.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P216_S1	The expected volatility is based on a combination of our historical stock price and implied volatility.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P217_S0	The risk-free interest rate is based upon the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the options.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P217_S1	The expected life of our stock options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is based on historical experience of similar options, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P218_S0	Option valuation models require the input of subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility and expected life.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P218_S1	Because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, we do not believe that the Black-Scholes model necessarily provides a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P219_S0	Options outstanding at December 31, 2012 and their related weighted average exercise price, intrinsic value and life information is presented below: At December 31, 2012, the aggregate intrinsic value and weighted average remaining contractual life for options vested and expected to vest were $33.9 million and 1.8 years, respectively.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P219_S1	Total compensation expense related to stock options was $2.4 million, $3.5 million and $3.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P219_S2	At December 31, 2012, total unrecognized estimated compensation cost related to non-vested stock options was approximately $0.5 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 0.8 years.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P219_S3	The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $16.4 million, $39.9 million and $14.5 million, respectively.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P219_S4	We recorded cash received from stock option exercises of $20.3 million, $7.1 million and $2.4 million and related tax benefit of $2.9 million, $14.9 million and $5.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P220_S0	Upon option exercise, we issue new shares of stock.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P221_S0	Excess tax benefits exist when the tax deduction resulting from the exercise of options exceeds the compensation cost recorded.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P222_S0	Non-Vested Stock Awards We have issued non-vested stock awards, including restricted stock units and restricted shares, in our Class A common stock to certain of our employees and members of our board of directors.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P222_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2012, we granted 2,353,487 of non-vested stock units which primarily vest and are exercisable generally in equal annual increments over four years from the date of grant.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P223_S0	non-vested stock units during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, which primarily vest in 2015 and 2016.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P223_S1	No restricted shares were granted during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P223_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we granted 2,803,221 and 1,196,720 of restricted shares, respectively, which primarily vest and are exercisable generally in equal annual increments over four years from the date of grant.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P223_S3	A summary of the status of our non-vested stock awards is presented in the table below: Total compensation expense related to non-vested stock awards was $49.4 million, $40.8 million and $43.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P223_S4	At December 31, 2012, total unrecognized estimated compensation cost related to non-vested stock awards was approximately $106.5 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.9 years.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P224_S0	We have bonus programs covering select employees, including senior management.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P224_S1	Awards are based on the position and performance of the employee and the achievement of pre-established financial, operating and strategic objectives.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P224_S2	The amounts charged to expense for bonuses were $134.5 million, $154.4 million and $135.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P225_S0	Our CBRE 401(k) Plan (401(k) Plan) is a defined contribution savings plan that allows participant deferrals under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P225_S1	Most of our non-union U.S. employees, other than qualified real estate agents having the status of independent contractors under section 3508 of the Internal Revenue Code, are eligible to participate in the plan.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P225_S2	The 401(k) Plan provides for participant contributions as well as a Company match.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P225_S3	A participant is allowed to contribute to the 401(k) Plan from 1% to 75% of his or her compensation, subject to limits imposed by applicable law.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P225_S4	Effective January 1, 2007, all participants hired post January 1, 2007 vest in company match contributions 20% per year for each plan year they work 1,000 hours.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P225_S5	All participants hired before January 1, 2007 are immediately vested in company match contributions.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P225_S6	The Company match was suspended in 2010 due to adverse economic conditions.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P225_S7	However, we made a partial retroactive match for 2010 401(k) participants who were employed at December 31, 2010, which was included in the $2.7 million expense for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P225_S8	As of January 1, 2011, the Company match was reinstated.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P225_S9	For 2011 and 2012, we contributed a 50% match on the first 3% of annual compensation (up to $150,000 of compensation) deferred by each participant.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P225_S10	In connection with the 401(k) Plan, we charged to expense $12.9 million, $10.9 million and $2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P226_S0	Participants are entitled to invest up to 25% of their 401(k) account balance in shares of our common stock.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P226_S1	As of December 31, 2012, approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock were held as investments by participants in our 401(k) Plan.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P227_S0	We have two contributory defined benefit pension plans in the U.K.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P227_S1	The London-based firm of Hillier Parker May Rowden, which we acquired in 1998, had a contributory defined benefit pension plan.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P227_S2	A subsidiary of Insignia, which we acquired in connection with the Insignia Acquisition in 2003, also had a contributory defined benefit pension plan in the U.K.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P227_S3	Our subsidiaries based in the U.K. maintain the plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in these plans.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P227_S4	With respect to these plans, our historical policy has been to contribute annually an amount to fund pension cost as actuarially determined and as required by applicable laws and regulations.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P227_S5	Effective July 1, 2007, we reached agreements with the active members of these plans to freeze future pension plan benefits.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P227_S6	In return, the active members became eligible to enroll in a defined contribution plan.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P227_S7	The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the benefit obligation, plan assets, plan s funded status and amounts recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets for both of our defined benefit pension plans (dollars in thousands):
1138118_13_ITEM8_P227_S8	The accumulated benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans was $352.2 million and $316.2 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P227_S9	Items not yet recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost were as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_13_ITEM8_P228_S0	The estimated net actuarial loss that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic pension cost in 2013 is $2.6 million.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P228_S1	Components of net periodic pension cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive loss (income) consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_13_ITEM8_P229_S0	Weighted average assumptions used to determine our projected benefit obligation were as follows:
1138118_13_ITEM8_P229_S1	Weighted average assumptions used to determine our net periodic pension cost were as follows: We select a discount rate by reference to yields available at our balance sheet date on U.K. AA-rated corporate bonds.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P230_S0	The corporate bond yield curve is derived by taking a government bond yield curve, based on Bank of England data and adding an amount to reflect the yield spread on AA-rated bonds over government bonds.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P230_S1	This discount rate selected is the weighted average of the yields on the resulting bond yield curve, where the weighting is based on the expected cash flow from the weighted average duration of the pension plans.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P231_S0	We review historical rates of return for equity and fixed income securities, as well as current economic conditions, to determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P231_S1	The assumed rate of return for 2012 is based on 66.7% of the portfolio being invested in equities yielding a 6.8% return and 22.7% of assets being primarily invested in corporate and government debt securities yielding a 3.9% return.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P231_S2	Consideration is given to diversification and periodic rebalancing of the portfolio based on prevailing market conditions.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P232_S0	Our pension plan weighted average asset allocations by asset category were as follows:
1138118_13_ITEM8_P233_S0	Our pension trust assets are invested with a long-term focus to achieve a return on investment that is based on levels of liquidity and investment risk that the trustees, in consultation with management believe are prudent and reasonable.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P233_S1	The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income and index linked investments consisting primarily of government debt.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P233_S2	The equity investments are diversified across U.K. and non-U.K. equities, as well as value, growth, and medium and large capitalizations.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P233_S3	The portfolio s asset mix is reviewed regularly, and the portfolio is rebalanced based on existing market conditions.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P233_S4	Investment risk is measured and monitored on a regular basis through quarterly portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements and periodic asset/liability analyses.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P233_S5	The fair value of our pension assets are comprised of the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_13_ITEM8_P234_S0	(a) The assets in this category represent investments in foreign equity and bond funds.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P234_S1	Generally, these assets are valued using bid-market valuations provided by the funds investment managers.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P235_S0	(b) The assets in this category include investments in a liability driven investment fund and investments in commercial real estate.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P235_S1	The liability driven investment fund is a single priced fund and the fair value of the underlying assets are priced by the fund s custodian based on observable market data and therefore categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P236_S0	The fair values for these investments are based on inputs obtained from broker quotes that are indicative of value and cannot be corroborated by observable market data and therefore are categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P236_S1	A summary of our pension assets measured and recorded using significant unobservable inputs is as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_13_ITEM8_P237_S0	We expect to contribute $5.5 million to our pension plans in 2013.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P238_S0	The following is a schedule by year of benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, that are expected to be paid (dollars in thousands):
1138118_13_ITEM8_P239_S0	We also have defined contribution plans for employees in the U.K.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P239_S1	Our contributions to these plans were approximately $9.6 million, $8.7 million and $7.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P240_S0	The components of income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_13_ITEM8_P241_S0	Our tax provision (benefit) consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_13_ITEM8_P242_S0	The following is a reconciliation stated as a percentage of pre-tax income of the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate:
1138118_13_ITEM8_P242_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, we recorded a $5.3 million, $15.5 million and $5.6 million income tax benefit in connection with stock options exercised.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P242_S2	Of this income tax benefit, $2.9 million, $14.9 million and $5.4 million was charged directly to additional paid-in capital within the equity section of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P243_S0	Cumulative tax effects of temporary differences are shown below at December 31, 2012 and 2011 (dollars in thousands): As of December 31, 2012, we had U.S. federal net operating losses (NOLs) of approximately $4.2 million, translating to a deferred tax asset before valuation allowance of $1.5 million, which will begin to expire in 2023.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P243_S1	As of December 31, 2012, there were also deferred tax assets before valuation allowances of approximately $6.8 million related to state NOLs as well as $33.4 million related to foreign NOLs.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P243_S2	The state and foreign NOLs both begin to expire in 2013.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P244_S0	The utilization of NOLs may be subject to certain limitations under U.S. federal, state and foreign laws.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P244_S1	In addition, as of December 31, 2012, we had $84.9 million of foreign income tax credits that can be utilized to offset U.S. federal income taxes on foreign-sourced earnings.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P244_S2	These credits will begin to expire in 2022.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P245_S0	Management determined that as of December 31, 2012, $76.2 million of deferred tax assets do not satisfy the recognition criteria set forth in Topic 740.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P245_S1	Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been recorded for this amount.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P245_S2	If released, the entire amount would result in a benefit to continuing operations.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P245_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2012, our valuation allowance increased by approximately $38.5 million.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P245_S4	This was primarily the result of the establishment of valuation allowances of $40.4 million related to U.S. foreign tax credits, $6.4 million related to non-U.S. net operating losses and other assets, $2.0 million related to other U.S. assets and $1.6 million related to foreign net operating loss adjustments.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P245_S5	These increases were partially offset by the utilization of $11.9 million of non-U.S. net operating losses and other foreign assets.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P245_S6	Management believes it is more likely than not that future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets recorded net of these valuation allowances.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P245_S7	During 2012, we identified opportunities to repatriate $191.0 million to the U.S., $58.0 million in 2012 and $133.0 million in 2013, which resulted in $28.8 million of tax benefit in 2012.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P245_S8	We have not recorded a deferred tax liability for $1.1 billion of remaining undistributed earnings of subsidiaries located outside of the U.S.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P245_S9	Although tax liabilities might result from the payment of dividends out of such earnings, or as a result of a sale or liquidation of non-U.S. subsidiaries, these earnings are permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. and we do not have any plans to repatriate these earnings or to sell or liquidate any of these non-U.S. subsidiaries.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P246_S0	that we are able to repatriate the unremitted earnings in a tax efficient manner, or in the event of a change in our capital situation or investment strategy in which such funds become needed for funding our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds, net of foreign tax credits.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P247_S0	The determination of the tax liability upon repatriation is not practicable.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P247_S1	Cash and cash equivalents owned by non-U.S. subsidiaries totaled $263.4 million at December 31, 2012.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P247_S2	The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $95.6 million and $91.7 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P247_S3	The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect our effective tax rate, if recognized, is $51.5 million ($49.4 million, net of federal benefit received from state positions) and $43.0 million ($41.8 million, net of federal benefit received from state positions) as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P247_S4	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 is as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_13_ITEM8_P248_S0	We believe it is reasonably possible that between $24.6 million and $68.7 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits will be settled during the next twelve months due to filing amended returns and the conclusion of an advanced pricing agreement.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P248_S1	Our continuing practice is to recognize potential accrued interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters within income tax expense.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P248_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, we accrued an additional $3.3 million, $3.4 million and $2.9 million, respectively, in interest associated with uncertain tax positions.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P248_S3	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we have recognized a liability for interest and penalties of $30.4 million ($24.1 million, net of related federal benefit received from interest expense) and $27.1 million ($21.8 million, net of related federal benefit received from interest expense), respectively.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P249_S0	We conduct business globally and, as a result, one or more of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and multiple state, local and foreign jurisdictions.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P249_S1	We are no longer subject to U.S. federal Internal Revenue Service audits for years prior to 2005.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P249_S2	With limited exception, our significant state and foreign tax jurisdictions are no longer subject to audit by the various tax authorities for tax years prior to 2005.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P250_S0	Our board of directors is authorized, subject to any limitations imposed by law, without the approval of our stockholders, to issue a total of 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, in one or more series, with each such series having rights and preferences including voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences, as our board of directors may determine.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P251_S0	The following is a calculation of earnings per share (dollars in thousands, except share data):
1138118_13_ITEM8_P251_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, 2,210,383, 11,880 and 112,865, respectively, of contingently issuable shares and options to purchase 103,423, 55,587 and 115,775 shares, respectively, of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P251_S2	The accompanying consolidated balance sheets do not include the net assets of escrow, agency and fiduciary funds, which are held by us on behalf of clients and which amounted to $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P252_S0	Discontinued Operations In the ordinary course of business, we dispose of real estate assets, or hold real estate assets for sale, that may be considered components of an entity in accordance with Topic 360.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P252_S1	If we do not have, or expect to have, significant continuing involvement with the operation of these real estate assets after disposition, we are required to recognize operating profits or losses and gains or losses on disposition of these assets as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations in the periods in which they occur.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P252_S2	Real estate operations and dispositions accounted for as discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were reported in our Global Investment Management and Development Services segments and totaled the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_13_ITEM8_P253_S0	Segments We report our operations through the following segments: (1) Americas, (2) EMEA, (3) Asia Pacific, (4) Global Investment Management and (5) Development Services.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P254_S0	The Americas segment is our largest segment of operations and provides a comprehensive range of services throughout the U.S. and in the largest regions of Canada and key markets in Latin America.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P254_S1	The primary services offered consist of the following: real estate services, mortgage loan origination and servicing, valuation services, asset services and corporate services.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P254_S2	Our EMEA and Asia Pacific segments provide services similar to the Americas business segment.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P254_S3	The EMEA segment has operations primarily in Europe, while the Asia Pacific segment has operations primarily in Asia, Australia and New Zealand.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P255_S0	Our Global Investment Management business provides investment management services to clients seeking to generate returns and diversification through direct and indirect investments in real estate in North America, Europe and Asia.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P255_S1	Our Development Services business consists of real estate development and investment activities primarily in the U.S.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P256_S0	Summarized financial information by segment is as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_13_ITEM8_P257_S0	EBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P257_S1	Our management believes EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P257_S2	Such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P257_S3	As a result, our management uses EBITDA as a measure to evaluate the operating performance of our various business segments and for other discretionary purposes, including as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive programs.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P257_S4	Additionally, we believe EBITDA is useful to investors to assist them in getting a more complete picture of our results from operations.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P258_S0	Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P258_S1	Furthermore, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management s discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P258_S2	The amounts shown for EBITDA also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P259_S0	Net interest expense and write-off of financing costs have been expensed in the segment incurred.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P259_S1	Provision for (benefit of) income taxes has been allocated among our segments by using applicable U.S. and foreign effective tax rates.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P259_S2	EBITDA for our segments is calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_13_ITEM8_P260_S0	Identifiable assets by industry segment are those assets used in our operations in each segment.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P260_S1	Corporate identifiable assets include cash and cash equivalents available for general corporate use and net deferred tax assets.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P261_S0	The revenue shown in the table above is allocated based upon the country in which services are performed.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P261_S1	The long-lived assets shown in the table above are comprised of net property and equipment.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P261_S2	Related Party Transactions Included in prepaid expenses, other current assets and other long-term assets, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are loans to related parties, primarily employees, of $66.5 million and $52.3 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P261_S3	The majority of these loans represent sign-on and retention bonuses issued or assumed in connection with acquisitions and prepaid commissions as well as prepaid retention and recruitment awards issued to employees.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P261_S4	These loans are at varying principal amounts, bear interest at rates up to 5.1% per annum and mature on various dates through 2022.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P262_S0	Robert Sulentic, our President and Chief Executive Officer, committed to invest a minimum of $0.8 million in Trammell Crow Company Acquisitions I, L.P. and Trammell Crow Company Acquisitions II, L.P.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P263_S0	(through pooled co-investment vehicles organized for the investment of certain employees).
1138118_13_ITEM8_P263_S1	As of December 31, 2011, Mr. Sulentic had funded the full amount of his commitment in these investments.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P263_S2	These funds are closed-end real estate investment funds managed and sponsored by our subsidiary, Trammell Crow Company.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P263_S3	These investments were approved by our board of directors, including all of the disinterested members.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P264_S0	The following condensed consolidating financial information includes: (1) Condensed consolidating balance sheets as of December 31, 2012 and 2011; condensed consolidating statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010; condensed consolidating statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010; and condensed consolidating statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, of (a) CBRE Group, Inc. as the parent, (b) CBRE as the subsidiary issuer, (c) the guarantor subsidiaries, (d) the nonguarantor subsidiaries and (e) CBRE Group, Inc. on a consolidated basis; and (2) Elimination entries necessary to consolidate CBRE Group, Inc. as the parent, with CBRE and its guarantor and nonguarantor subsidiaries.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P264_S1	Investments in consolidated subsidiaries are presented using the equity method of accounting.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P264_S2	The principal elimination entries eliminate investments in consolidated subsidiaries and intercompany balances and transactions.
1138118_13_ITEM8_P265_S0	Although CBRE Capital Markets is included among our domestic subsidiaries, which jointly and severally guarantee our 11.625% senior subordinated notes, our 6.625% senior notes and our Credit Agreement, a substantial majority of warehouse receivables funded under the JP Morgan Master Repurchase Agreement, BofA, Capital One, TD Bank, JP Morgan and Fannie Mae ASAP lines of credit are pledged to JP Morgan, BofA, Capital One, TD Bank and Fannie Mae, and accordingly, are not included as collateral for these notes or our other outstanding debt.

1138118_13_ITEM8_P267_S0	(1) EPS is defined as earnings per share.
1138118_13_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Securities Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f), including maintenance of (i) records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets, and (ii) policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance that (a) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, (b) our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our Board of Directors and (c) we will prevent or timely detect unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1138118_13_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control.
1138118_13_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses of judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.
1138118_13_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper overriding of controls.
1138118_13_ITEM9A_P1_S3	As a result of such limitations, there is risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
1138118_13_ITEM9A_P1_S4	However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
1138118_13_ITEM9A_P1_S5	Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
1138118_13_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission.
1138118_13_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Based on our evaluation under the COSO framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2012.
1138118_13_ITEM9A_P2_S2	The effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.
1138118_13_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our policy for disclosure controls and procedures provides guidance on the evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures and is designed to ensure that all corporate disclosure is complete and accurate in all material respects and that all information required to be disclosed in the periodic reports submitted by us under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods and in the manner specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms.
1138118_13_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1138118_13_ITEM9A_P3_S2	As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures.
1138118_13_ITEM9A_P3_S3	Our Disclosure Committee consisting of the principal accounting officer, general counsel, chief communication officer, senior officers of each significant business line and other select employees assisted the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer in this evaluation.
1138118_13_ITEM9A_P3_S4	Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as required by the Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(c) as of the end of the period covered by this report.
1138118_13_ITEM9A_P4_S0	No changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

(the Company ), hereby certify as of the date hereof, solely for the purposes of 18 U.S.C. 1350, that: (i) the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2012, of the Company (the Report ) fully complies with the requirements of Section 13(a) and 15(d), as applicable, of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and (ii) the information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company at the dates and for the periods indicated.
1138118_13_ITEM15_P29_S0	The foregoing certification is being furnished solely pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 1350 and is not being filed as part of the Report or as a separate disclosure document.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P0_S0	CBRE Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, (which may be referred to in this Form 10-K as the company , we , us and our ) is the world s largest commercial real estate services and investment firm, based on 2013 revenue, with leading full-service operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P0_S1	We offer a full range of services to occupiers, owners, lenders and investors in office, retail, industrial, multifamily and other types of commercial real estate.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P0_S2	As of December 31, 2013, excluding independent affiliates, we operated in approximately 350 offices worldwide, with approximately 44,000 employees providing commercial real estate services under the CBRE brand name, investment management services under the CBRE Global Investors brand name and development services under the Trammell Crow brand name.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P0_S3	Our business is focused on several competencies, including commercial property and corporate facilities management, tenant/occupier and property/agency leasing, property sales, real estate investment management, valuation, commercial mortgage origination and servicing, capital markets (structured finance and debt) solutions, development services and proprietary research.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P0_S4	We generate revenues from management fees on a contractual and per-project basis, and from commissions on transactions.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P0_S5	Our contractual, fee-for-services businesses, which generally involve facilities management, property management, mortgage loan servicing and investment management, represented approximately 41% of our 2013 revenue.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P0_S6	We generated revenue from a well-balanced, highly diversified base of clients.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P0_S7	In 2013, our client roster included approximately 85 of the Fortune 100 companies, and consisted of firms in a broad range of industries as follows:
1138118_14_ITEM1_P1_S0	Property owners, occupiers and investors continue to consolidate their needs with fewer service providers, and are awarding their business to firms that have strong capabilities across major markets and service disciplines.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P1_S1	We believe we are well positioned to capture a growing and disproportionate share of the business being awarded as a result of these trends.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P1_S2	In 2013, we were the highest ranked commercial real estate services company among the Fortune Most Admired Companies, and were also named the Global Real Estate Advisor of the Year by Euromoney .
1138118_14_ITEM1_P1_S3	We have been the only commercial real estate services company included in the S P 500 since 2006, and in the Fortune 500 since 2008.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P1_S4	Additionally, the International Association of Outsourcing Professionals has included us among the top 100 global outsourcing companies across all industries for eight consecutive years, including in 2013 when we ranked fourth overall and were the highest ranked commercial real estate services company.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	CBRE History CBRE marked its 107 th year of continuous operations in 2013, tracing our origins to a company founded in San Francisco in the aftermath of the 1906 earthquake.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	series of strategic acquisitions, including the December 2006 purchase of Trammell Crow Company and the 2011 acquisition of substantially all of ING Group N.V. s Real Estate Investment Management (REIM) operations in Europe and Asia and its U.S.-based global real estate listed securities business (collectively referred to as the REIM Acquisitions).
1138118_14_ITEM1_P3_S1	In 2013, we fortified our real estate outsourcing platform in Europe with the acquisition of London-based Norland Managed Services Ltd (Norland).
1138118_14_ITEM1_P3_S2	Norland is a premier provider of building technical engineering services that enables us to self-perform these services in Europe and adds to our expertise in the highly specialized critical environments market.

1138118_14_ITEM1_P6_S1	Within our Americas segment, we organize our services into the following business areas:
1138118_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	Our advisory services businesses offer occupier/tenant and investor/owner services that meet the full spectrum of marketplace needs, including (1) real estate services, (2) capital markets and (3) valuation.

1138118_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	Within advisory services, our major service lines are the following:
1138118_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	We provide strategic advice and execution to owners, investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with leasing, disposition and acquisition of property.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P9_S1	Our many years of strong local market presence have allowed us to develop significant repeat business from existing clients, including approximately 67% of our revenues from existing U.S. real estate sales and leasing clients in 2013.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P9_S2	This includes referrals from other parts of our business.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P9_S3	Our real estate services professionals are particularly adept at aligning real estate strategies with client business objectives, serving as advisors as well as transaction executors.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P9_S4	We believe we are a market leader for the provision of sales and leasing real estate services in most top U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau), including Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix and San Francisco.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P9_S5	Our real estate services professionals are compensated primarily through commission-based programs, which are payable upon completion of an assignment.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P9_S6	Therefore, as compensation is our largest expense, this cost structure gives us flexibility to mitigate the negative effect on our operating margins during difficult market conditions.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	Due to the low barriers to entry and significant competition for quality employees, we strive to retain top professionals through an attractive compensation program tied to productivity.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P10_S1	We believe we invest in greater support resources than most other firms, including professional development and training, market research and information, technology, branding and marketing.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P10_S2	We also foster an entrepreneurial culture that emphasizes client service and rewards performance.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P10_S3	We further strengthen our relationships with our real estate services clients by offering proprietary research to them through CBRE Research Consulting and CBRE Econometric Advisors, or CBRE-EA, our commercial real estate market information and forecasting groups.

1138118_14_ITEM1_P12_S1	In the United States, our mortgage loan origination volume in 2013 was $23.2 billion, representing an increase of approximately 21% from 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P12_S2	Approximately $7.8 billion of loans in 2013 were originated for federal government-sponsored entities, most of which were financed through revolving credit lines dedicated exclusively for this purpose.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P12_S3	We substantially mitigate the principal risk associated with loans financed through these credit lines prior to closing by either obtaining a contractual purchase commitment from the government-sponsored entity or confirming a forward-trade commitment for the issuance and purchase of a mortgage-backed security that will be secured by the loan.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P12_S4	We advised on the sale of approximately $2.5 billion of mortgages on behalf of financial institutions in 2013, compared with $2.0 billion in 2012.

1138118_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	Outsourcing Services Outsourcing commercial real estate services is a long-term trend in our industry, with corporations, institutions, public sector entities, health care providers and others seeking to achieve improved efficiency, better execution and lower costs by relying on the expertise of third-party real estate specialists.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P15_S1	Two of our service offerings seek to capitalize on the outsourcing trend: (1) occupier outsourcing, which we provide through our Global Corporate Services business line, and (2) property management, which we provide through our Asset Services business line.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P15_S2	Agreements with our occupier outsourcing clients, which are generally occupiers of space, are typically long-term arrangements with penalties for early termination.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P15_S3	Our management agreements with our property management clients, which are owners/investors in real estate, may be terminated with notice generally ranging between 30 to 90 days; however, we have developed long-term relationships with many of these clients and we work closely with them to implement their specific goals and objectives and to preserve and expand upon these relationships.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P15_S4	As of December 31, 2013, we managed approximately 1.7 billion square feet of commercial space for property owners and occupiers in the Americas, which we believe represents one of the largest portfolios in the region.

1138118_14_ITEM1_P16_S2	The long-term, contractual nature of these relationships enables us to devise and execute real estate strategies that support our clients overall business strategies.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P16_S3	Our clients include leading global corporations, health care providers and public sector entities with large, geographically-diverse real estate portfolios.

1138118_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	Contracts for facilities management services are typically structured so we receive reimbursement of client-dedicated personnel costs and associated overhead expenses plus a monthly fee, and in some cases, annual incentives if agreed-upon performance targets are satisfied.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P19_S1	In general, portfolio and transaction services contribute revenue on a transaction basis; project management and facilities management contribute contractual, or per-project, revenue and strategic consulting services contribute both transaction and contractual revenue.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	Through our Asset Services business line, we provide property management services on a contractual basis for owners/investors in office, industrial and retail properties.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P20_S1	These services include construction management, marketing, leasing, accounting and financial services.

1138118_14_ITEM1_P37_S1	Each business discipline is highly competitive on an international, national, regional and local level.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P37_S2	Although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2013 revenue, our relative competitive position varies significantly across markets, property types and services.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P37_S3	Depending on the geography, property type or service, we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers that compete with us on a local, regional, national or global basis or within a market segment; outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have recently expanded their offerings; in-house corporate real estate departments and property owners/developers that self-perform real estate services; investment banking firms, investment managers and developers that compete with us to raise and place investment capital; and accounting/consulting firms that advise on real estate strategies.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P37_S4	Some of these firms may have greater financial resources than we do.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	Despite recent consolidation, the commercial real estate services industry remains highly fragmented and competitive.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P38_S1	Although many of our competitors are substantially smaller than us, some of them are larger on a local or regional basis or have a stronger position in a market segment.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P38_S2	In addition, it is also possible that two or more of our competitors could combine to create a much larger and more formidable global competitor.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P38_S3	Among our primary competitors are other large multi-national firms, such as Cushman Wakefield, Jones Lang LaSalle, FirstService Corporation (the publicly traded parent of Colliers International), Savills and DTZ; national firms such as Newmark Grubb Knight Frank and Cassidy Turley; market-segment specialists, such as HFF and Eastdil Secured; and large global firms that compete with our outsourcing business, such as Johnson Controls, Inc.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	Seasonality A significant portion of our revenue is seasonal, which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P40_S0	Historically, our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flow from operating activities tends to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P40_S1	Earnings and cash flow have historically been particularly concentrated in the fourth quarter due to the focus on completing sales, financing and leasing transactions prior to calendar year-end.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P40_S2	This has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first quarter, with revenue and profitability improving in each subsequent quarter.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	Employees At December 31, 2013, excluding our independent affiliates, we had approximately 44,000 employees worldwide, approximately 40% of which represent costs that are fully reimbursed by clients and are mostly in our outsourcing services lines of business.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P41_S1	At December 31, 2013, 946 of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements, most of whom are on-site employees in our asset services business in California, Illinois, New Jersey and New York.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	We believe that relations with our employees are generally good.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P43_S0	We hold various trademarks and trade names worldwide, which include the CBRE name.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P43_S1	Although we believe our intellectual property plays a role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve, we do not believe we would be materially, adversely affected by expiration or termination of our trademarks or trade names or the loss of any of our other intellectual property rights other than the CBRE, CB Richard Ellis and Trammell Crow names.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P44_S0	With respect to the CBRE and CB Richard Ellis names, we maintain trademark registrations for these service marks in jurisdictions where we conduct significant business.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P44_S1	We obtained our most recent U.S. trademark registrations for the CBRE and CB Richard Ellis related marks in 2005, and these registrations would expire in 2015 if we failed to renew them.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P44_S2	We hold a license to use the Trammell Crow trade name pursuant to a license agreement with CF98, L.P., an affiliate of Crow Realty Investors, L.P., d/b/a Crow Holdings, which may be revoked if we fail to satisfy usage and quality control covenants under the license agreement.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P45_S0	In addition to trade names, we have developed proprietary technologies for the provision of complex services and analysis through our global outsourcing business and for preparing and developing valuation reports for our clients through our valuation business.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P45_S1	We also offer proprietary research to clients through our CBRE-EA research unit and we offer proprietary investment analysis and structures through CBRE Global Investors.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P46_S0	While we seek to secure our rights under applicable intellectual property protection laws in these and any other proprietary assets that we use in our business, we do not believe any of these other items of intellectual property are material to our business in the aggregate.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P47_S0	Environmental Matters Federal, state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business impose environmental liabilities, controls, disclosure rules and zoning restrictions that affect the ownership, management, development, use, or sale of commercial real estate.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P47_S1	Certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability on current or previous real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating, cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property, including contamination resulting from above-ground or underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos or lead at a property.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P47_S2	If contamination occurs or is present during our role as a property or facility manager or developer, we could be held liable for such costs as a current operator of a property, regardless of the legality of the acts or omissions that caused the contamination and without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P47_S3	The operator of a site also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from exposure to hazardous substances or environmental contamination at a site, including liabilities arising from exposure to asbestos-containing materials.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P48_S0	Under certain laws and common law principles, any failure by us to disclose environmental contamination at a property could subject us to liability to a buyer or lessee of the property.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P48_S1	Further, federal, state and local governments in the countries in which we do business have enacted various laws, regulations, and treaties governing environmental and climate change, particularly for greenhouse gases, which seek to tax, penalize, or limit their release.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P48_S2	Such regulations could lead to increased operational or compliance costs over time.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P49_S0	historical or ongoing activities on those properties, we are not aware of any material noncompliance with the environmental laws or regulations currently applicable to us, and we are not the subject of any material claim for liability with respect to contamination at any location.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P49_S1	However, these laws and regulations may discourage sales and leasing activities and mortgage lending with respect to some properties, which may adversely affect both us and the commercial real estate services industry in general.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P49_S2	Environmental contamination or other environmental liabilities may also negatively affect the value of commercial real estate assets held by entities that are managed by our investment management and development services businesses, which could adversely affect the results of operations of these business lines.

1138118_14_ITEM1_P52_S0	Item 1A. Risk Factors Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report and other public statements we make.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P52_S1	Based on the information currently known to us, we believe that the matters discussed below identify the material risk factors affecting our business.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P52_S2	However, the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P52_S3	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P52_S4	The success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and, accordingly, our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by economic slowdowns, liquidity crises, fiscal uncertainty and possible subsequent downturns in commercial real estate asset values, property sales and leasing activities.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P53_S0	Many of the world s largest economies and financial institutions continue to be affected by ongoing global economic and financial issues, with some continuing to face financial difficulty, fiscal uncertainty, pressure on asset prices, liquidity problems and limited availability of credit, made worse in certain areas by increased unemployment or limited economic growth.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P54_S0	and financial trends in those areas, particularly in Europe, will worsen or improve.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P54_S1	The current economic situation may be exacerbated if additional negative geo-political or economic developments, natural disasters or other disruptions were to arise.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P54_S2	Periods of economic weakness or recession, significantly rising interest rates, fiscal uncertainty, declining employment levels, declining demand for commercial real estate, falling real estate values, disruption to the global capital or credit markets, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, may negatively affect the performance of some or all of our business lines.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P54_S3	Our business is significantly affected by generally prevailing economic conditions in the principal markets where we operate, which can result in a general decline in real estate acquisition, disposition and leasing activity, as well as a general decline in the value of commercial real estate and in rents, which in turn reduces revenue from property management fees and commissions derived from property sales, leasing, valuation and financing, as well as revenues associated with development or investment management activities.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P54_S4	Our capital markets business could also suffer from any political or economic disruption that affects interest rates or liquidity.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P54_S5	In addition, we could experience a reduction in the amount of fees we earn in our Global Investment Management business if our assets under management decrease or those assets fail to perform as anticipated.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P54_S6	These economic conditions could also lead to a decline in property sales prices as well as a decline in funds invested in existing commercial real estate assets and properties planned for development.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P55_S0	Our development and investment strategy often entails making relatively modest co-investments alongside our investor clients.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P55_S1	Our ability to conduct these activities depends in part on the supply of investment capital for commercial real estate and related assets.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P55_S2	During an economic downturn, investment capital is usually constrained and it may take longer for us to dispose of real estate investments or selling prices may be lower than originally anticipated.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P55_S3	As a result, the value of our commercial real estate investments may be reduced, and we could realize losses or diminished profitability.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P55_S4	In addition, economic downturns may reduce the amount of loan originations and related servicing by our commercial mortgage brokerage business.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P56_S0	Performance of our asset services line of business partially depends upon the performance of the properties we manage because our fees are generally based on a percentage of aggregate rent collections from these properties.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P56_S1	The performance of these properties may be affected by many factors which are partially or completely outside of our control, including: (i) real estate and financial market conditions prevailing generally and locally; (ii) our ability to attract and retain creditworthy tenants, particularly during economic downturns; and (iii) the magnitude of defaults by tenants under their respective leases, which may increase during distressed conditions.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P56_S2	For example, during 2008 and 2009, credit became severely constrained and prohibitively expensive, and real estate market activity contracted sharply in most markets around the world as a result of the global financial crisis and the deep economic recession.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P56_S3	These adverse macro conditions affected commercial real estate services companies like ours by significantly hampering transaction activity and lowering real estate valuations.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P56_S4	Similar to other commercial real estate services firms, our transaction volumes fell during 2008 and most of 2009, and as a result, our stock price declined significantly.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P56_S5	If the economic and market conditions that prevailed in 2008 and 2009 were to return, our business performance and profitability could again deteriorate.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P56_S6	Most recently, in the United States, continued uncertainty over fiscal and tax policy has caused, and may continue to cause, our clients to delay or cancel commercial real estate transactions which may affect our revenues.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P57_S0	The economic situation in Europe remains unstable, arising from the various austerity policies and continuing credit restrictions.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P57_S1	If the nascent recovery in certain European economies does not gain traction, or if conditions remain unstable or worsen, our revenues may be adversely affected.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P58_S0	to predict our revenue and earnings into the future.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P58_S1	As a result, any revenue or earnings guidance or outlook, which we have given or might give, may be overtaken by events, or may otherwise turn out to be inaccurate.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P58_S2	Though we endeavor to give reasonable estimates of future revenue and earnings at the time we give such guidance based on then-current conditions, there is a significant risk that such guidance or outlook will turn out to be, or to have been, incorrect.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P59_S0	Adverse developments in the credit markets may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P59_S1	Our Global Investment Management, Development Services and Capital Markets (including investment property sales and debt and structured financing services) businesses are sensitive to credit cost and availability as well as marketplace liquidity.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P59_S2	Additionally, the revenues in all of our businesses are dependent to some extent on the overall volume of activity (and pricing) in the commercial real estate market.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P60_S0	Disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business of providing advisory services to owners, investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with the leasing, disposition and acquisition of property.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P60_S1	If our clients are unable to procure credit on favorable terms, there may be fewer completed leasing transactions, dispositions and acquisitions of property.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P60_S2	In addition, if purchasers of commercial real estate are not able to procure favorable financing resulting in the lack of disposition opportunities for our funds and projects, our Global Investment Management and Development Services businesses will be unable to generate incentive fees, and we may also experience losses of co-invested equity capital if the disruption causes a permanent decline in the value of investments made.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P61_S0	In 2008 and 2009, the credit markets experienced a disruption of unprecedented magnitude.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P61_S1	This disruption reduced the availability and significantly increased the cost of most sources of funding.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P61_S2	In some cases, these sources were eliminated.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P62_S0	While the credit market has improved since the second half of 2009, liquidity remains constrained.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P62_S1	This uncertainty may lead market participants to continue to act more conservatively, which may amplify decreases in demand and pricing in the markets we serve.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P62_S2	Our goodwill and other intangible assets could become further impaired, which may require us to take significant non-cash charges against earnings.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P62_S3	Under current accounting guidelines, we must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P62_S4	Any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of such analysis would result in a non-cash charge against earnings, which charge could materially adversely affect our reported results of operations, stockholders equity and our stock price.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P62_S5	For example, during the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a non-amortizable intangible asset impairment of $98.1 million in our Global Investment Management segment.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P62_S6	This non-cash write-off was related to a decrease in value of our open-end funds, primarily in Europe.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P62_S7	These funds have experienced a decline in assets under management, as the business mix shifts toward separate accounts, consistent with market movements following the extended financial crisis in Europe, which has resulted in project sales and planned liquidations of certain funds.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P62_S8	A significant and sustained decline in our future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the economic environment, slower growth rates or if our stock price falls below our net book value per share for a sustained period, could result in the need to perform additional impairment analysis in future periods.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P62_S9	If we were to conclude that a future write-down of goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary, then we would record such additional charges, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P62_S10	Our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees (including those acquired through acquisitions).
1138118_14_ITEM1_P62_S11	Our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees, including Robert E. Sulentic, our President and Chief Executive Officer.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P63_S0	other key employees are not parties to employment agreements with us.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P63_S1	We also are highly dependent upon the retention of our property sales and leasing professionals, who generate a significant amount of our revenues, as well as other revenue producing professionals.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P63_S2	The departure of any of our key employees (including those acquired through acquisitions), or the loss of a significant number of key revenue producers, if we are unable to quickly hire and integrate qualified replacements, could cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to suffer.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P63_S3	Competition for these personnel is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit, integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P63_S4	In addition, the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified support personnel in all areas of our business, including brokerage and property and investment management personnel.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P63_S5	We use equity incentives to help retain and incentivize many of our key personnel.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P63_S6	Any significant decline in, or failure to grow, our stock price may result in an increased risk of loss of these key personnel.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P63_S7	If we are unable to attract and retain these qualified personnel, our growth may be limited and our business and operating results could suffer.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P63_S8	Our international operations subject us to social, political and economic risks of doing business in foreign countries.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P63_S9	We conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the United States and as a result, we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P63_S10	During 2013, we generated approximately 39% of our revenue from operations outside the United States.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P63_S11	With the REIM Acquisitions, the footprint of our Global Investment Management business significantly expanded, particularly in Europe and Asia, and with the acquisition of Norland, our Global Corporate Services business will expand significantly in Europe.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P63_S12	Additional circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations include, but are not limited to, the following factors:
1138118_14_ITEM1_P64_S0	foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in countries such as China.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P65_S0	Although we maintain anti-corruption and anti-money laundering compliance programs throughout the company, violations of our compliance programs may result in criminal or civil sanctions, including material monetary fines, penalties, equitable remedies (including disgorgement), and other costs against us or our employees, and may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P65_S1	We have committed additional resources to expand our worldwide sales and marketing activities, to globalize our service offerings and products in selected markets and to develop local sales and support channels.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P66_S0	manage the risks associated with our global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P66_S1	Our revenue and earnings may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P66_S2	Our revenue from non-U.S. operations is denominated primarily in the local currency where the associated revenue was earned.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P66_S3	During 2013, approximately 39% of our revenue was transacted in foreign currencies, the majority of which included the Euro, the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar, the Chinese yuan, the Hong Kong dollar, the Japanese yen, the Singapore dollar, the Australian dollar and the Indian rupee.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P67_S0	Our Global Investment Management business has a significant amount of Euro-denominated assets under management as well as associated revenue and earnings in Europe, which continues to experience economic stagnation that may result in deterioration in the value of the Euro against the U.S. dollar.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P67_S1	Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may result in corresponding fluctuations in our assets under management, revenue and earnings.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P67_S2	Over time, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and the Euro relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P67_S3	Due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P67_S4	In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the Euro may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P67_S5	From time to time, our management uses currency hedging instruments, including foreign currency forward and option contracts and borrows in foreign currencies.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P67_S6	There can be no assurance that these hedging instruments will be available when needed.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P67_S7	Additionally, economic risks associated with these hedging instruments include unexpected fluctuations in inflation rates, which affect cash flow, and unexpected changes in the underlying net asset position.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P68_S0	Our growth has benefited significantly from acquisitions, which may not be available in the future or perform as expected.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P68_S1	A significant component of our growth has occurred through acquisitions, including the REIM Acquisitions that we completed in the second half of 2011 and our acquisition of Norland in 2013.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P68_S2	Any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions, which may not be available to us, as well as sufficient liquidity and credit to fund these acquisitions.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P68_S3	We may incur significant additional debt from time to time to finance any such acquisitions, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our then-existing indebtedness.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P68_S4	If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our then-existing debt, would increase.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P69_S0	Acquisitions involve risks that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P69_S1	Future acquisitions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transaction-related expenses, which include severance, lease termination, transaction and deferred financing costs, among others.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P70_S0	We have had, and may continue to experience, challenges in integrating operations and information technology systems acquired from other companies.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P70_S1	This could result in the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of our key employees or those of the acquired operations.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P70_S2	The integration process itself may be disruptive to our business as it requires coordination of geographically diverse organizations and implementation of new accounting and information technology systems.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P71_S0	We believe that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on operating and net income.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P71_S1	Acquisitions also frequently involve significant costs related to integrating information technology, accounting and management services and rationalizing personnel levels.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P72_S0	The anticipated benefits of the REIM Acquisitions, Norland acquisition and other acquisitions we make may not be realized as we contemplated.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P72_S1	We completed the REIM Acquisitions as well as other acquisitions (such as the acquisition of Norland) with the expectation that such acquisitions would result in various benefits, including, among others, enhanced revenues, a strengthened market position, cross-selling opportunities and operating efficiencies.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P72_S2	Achieving the anticipated benefits of the REIM Acquisitions and other acquisitions will be subject to a number of uncertainties, including the realization of accretive benefits in the timeframe anticipated.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P72_S3	Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management s time and energy, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P73_S0	Our revenue, net income and cash flow generated by our Global Investment Management business can vary significantly as a result of market developments.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P73_S1	With the completion of the REIM Acquisitions, our Global Investment Management business significantly increased and became more globally diverse.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P73_S2	With the addition of the REIM funds, a substantial part of our fees are more recurring in nature.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P73_S3	However, the revenue, net income and cash flow generated by our Global Investment Management business are all somewhat variable, primarily due to the fact that management, transaction and incentive fees can vary as a result of market movements from one period to another.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P73_S4	The pace at which the real estate markets worldwide turned from positive to negative starting in 2007 and continuing into 2009 is an example of the market volatility to which we are subject and over which we have no control.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P74_S0	The underlying market conditions, decisions regarding the acquisition and disposition of fund and separate account assets, and the specifics of client mandates will cause the amount of asset management, transaction and incentive fees to vary from one product to another.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P74_S1	A substantial part of our fees are based upon the value of the assets we manage, and if asset values deteriorate, our asset management fees will decline as a result.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P74_S2	Our acquisition and disposition fees can decline as a result of delay in the deployment of capital or limited market liquidity.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P74_S3	We also earn incentive fees tied to portfolio performance, which fees may decline if there is a downturn in real estate markets and we fail to meet benchmarks or absolute return hurdles.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P74_S4	Finally, during periods of economic weakness, recession or stagnation, existing and prospective clients in our Global Investment Management business may be less able or willing to commit new funds to real estate investments, which are inherently less liquid than many competing investment classes, thereby inhibiting the ability of our Global Investment Management business to raise new funds.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P74_S5	Additionally, investors with open commitments to provide additional investment could become less able or willing to honor their financial commitments and/or seek to renegotiate the terms of their commitments or the fees that they are obligated to pay.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P74_S6	To the extent that clients in our Global Investment Management business seek to avoid paying fees they are obligated to pay, or seek to avoid deploying capital that has been committed, we could experience a decrease in collection of fees and interruptions to our client relationships and business.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P74_S7	Our real estate investment and co-investment activities subject us to real estate investment risks which could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flow.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P74_S8	An important part of the strategy for our Global Investment Management business involves co-investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients, and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P74_S9	As of December 31, 2013, we had committed $9.4 million to fund future co-investments, $8.1 million of which is expected to be funded during 2014.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P74_S10	In addition to required future capital contributions, some of the co-investment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P74_S11	The failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments, including damage to our reputation with our co-investment partners and clients, as well as the necessity of obtaining alternative funding from other sources that may be on disadvantageous terms for us and the other co-investors.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P75_S0	Management business, which would suffer if we were unable to make these investments.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P76_S0	Although our debt instruments contain restrictions that limit our ability to provide capital to the entities holding direct or indirect interests in co-investments, we may provide this capital in many instances.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P76_S1	Selective investment in real estate projects is an important part of our Development Services business strategy, and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investment.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P76_S2	As of December 31, 2013, we had approximately 15 consolidated real estate projects with invested equity of $2.8 million and $4.0 million of notes payable on real estate that are recourse to us (in addition to being recourse to the single-purpose entity that holds the real estate asset and is the primary obligor on the note payable).
1138118_14_ITEM1_P76_S3	In addition, at December 31, 2013, we were involved as a principal (in most cases, co-investing with our clients) in approximately 50 unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries with invested equity of $80.3 million and had committed additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries of $25.0 million.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P76_S4	We also guaranteed notes payable of these unconsolidated subsidiaries of $3.2 million, excluding guarantees for which we have outstanding liabilities accrued on our consolidated balance sheet.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P77_S0	During the ordinary course of our Development Services business, we provide numerous completion and budget guarantees requiring us to complete the relevant project within a specified timeframe and/or within a specified budget, with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P77_S1	While we generally have guaranteed maximum price contracts with reputable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees (which are intended to pass most of the risk to such contractors), there can be no assurance that we will not have to perform under any such guarantees.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P77_S2	If we are required to perform under a significant number of such guarantees, it could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P77_S3	Because the disposition of a single significant investment can affect our financial performance in any period, our real estate investment activities could increase fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flow.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P77_S4	In many cases, we have limited control over the timing of the disposition of these investments and the recognition of any related gain or loss, or incentive participation fee.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P77_S5	Poor performance of the investment programs that our Global Investment Management business manages would cause a decline in our revenue, net income and cash flow and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future programs.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P77_S6	In the event that any of the investment programs that our Global Investment Management business manages were to perform poorly, our revenue, net income and cash flow could decline because the value of the assets we manage would decrease, which would result in a reduction in some of our management fees, and our investment returns would decrease, resulting in a reduction in the incentive compensation we earn.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P77_S7	Moreover, we could experience losses on co-investments of our own capital in such programs as a result of poor performance.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P77_S8	Investors and potential investors in our programs continually assess our performance, and our ability to raise capital for existing and future programs and maintaining our current fee structure will depend on our continued satisfactory performance.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P77_S9	Our debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us, and in the event of a default, all of our borrowings would become immediately due and payable.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P77_S10	Our debt instruments, including our credit agreement, impose, and the terms of any future debt may impose, operating and other restrictions on us and many of our subsidiaries.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P77_S11	These restrictions affect, and in many respects limit or prohibit, our ability to:
1138118_14_ITEM1_P78_S0	finance ongoing operations, strategic acquisitions, investments or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest, including:
1138118_14_ITEM1_P79_S0	Our credit agreement currently requires us to maintain a minimum coverage ratio of EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) to total interest expense of 2.00x and a maximum leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) of 4.25x.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P79_S1	Our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot give assurance that we will be able to meet those ratios when required.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P79_S2	For example, we experienced a decline in EBITDA during the economic downturn in 2008 to 2009, which negatively affected our minimum coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P79_S3	However, we significantly reduced our cost structure during 2008 and 2009, and, as a result of these cost reductions as well as renewed growth in our business, we were and continue to be well within compliance with the minimum coverage ratio and the maximum leverage ratio under our credit agreement.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P79_S4	Our coverage ratio of EBITDA to total interest expense was 8.97x for the year ended December 31, 2013 and our leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to EBITDA was 1.43x as of December 31, 2013.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P79_S5	We continue to monitor our projected compliance with these financial ratios and other terms of our credit agreement.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P79_S6	A breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our debt instruments.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P79_S7	If any such default occurs, the lenders under our credit agreement may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P79_S8	The lenders under our credit agreement also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P79_S9	If we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due, the lenders under our credit agreement will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt, which collateral is described in the immediately following risk factor.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P79_S10	If the debt under our credit agreement were to be accelerated, we cannot give assurance that this collateral would be sufficient to repay our debt.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P79_S11	In addition, such a breach under our credit agreement could trigger a cross default under our other debt instruments, including the notes under our indentures.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P79_S12	If we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under our credit agreement, the lenders under such credit agreement could foreclose on, and acquire control of, substantially all of our assets.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P79_S13	Our credit agreement is jointly and severally guaranteed by us and substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P79_S14	Borrowings under our credit agreement are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the capital stock of our U.S. subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P79_S15	In addition, in connection with any amendment to our credit agreement, we may need to grant additional collateral to the lenders.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P79_S16	If we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due, the lenders under our credit agreement will have the right to proceed against this pledged capital stock and take control of substantially all of our assets.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P80_S0	Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could harm our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P81_S0	We are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P81_S1	Our credit agreement currently provides for a $1.2 billion revolving credit facility; a $500.0 million tranche A term loan facility; and a $215.0 million tranche B term loan facility.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P81_S2	As of December 31, 2013, our total debt, excluding notes payable on real estate (which are generally nonrecourse to us) and warehouse lines of credit (which are recourse only to our wholly-owned subsidiary, CBRE Capital Markets, and are secured by our related warehouse receivables), was approximately $2.0 billion.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P81_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2013, our interest expense was approximately $135.1 million.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P81_S4	Our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of, or other amounts due in respect of, our indebtedness.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P81_S5	In addition, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or for other purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P81_S6	If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our debt, would increase.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P81_S7	If we are required to seek an amendment to our credit agreement, our debt service obligations may be substantially increased.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P81_S8	Our debt could have other important consequences, which include, but are not limited to, the following:
1138118_14_ITEM1_P82_S0	our level of debt may restrict us from raising additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and other general corporate requirements.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P82_S1	From time to time, Moody s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard Poor s Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., rate our significant outstanding debt.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P82_S2	These ratings and any downgrades thereof may affect our ability to borrow under any new agreements in the future, as well as the interest rates and other terms of any future borrowings, and could also cause a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock in addition to our outstanding debt instruments.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P83_S0	We cannot be certain that our earnings will be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P83_S1	If we do not have sufficient earnings, we may be required to seek to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or sell more securities, none of which we can guarantee that we will be able to do and which, if accomplished, may adversely affect our stock price.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P83_S2	We have limited restrictions on the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur, which may intensify the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our indebtedness.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P84_S0	equity we invest in these activities.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P84_S1	Subject to certain covenants in our various bank credit agreements, we are also not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt CBRE Capital Markets may incur in connection with funding loan originations for multifamily properties having prior purchase commitments by a government sponsored entity.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P84_S2	If we experience defaults by multiple clients or counterparties, it could adversely affect our business.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P84_S3	We could be adversely affected by the actions and deteriorating financial condition and results of operations of certain of our clients or counterparties if that led to losses or defaults by one or more of them, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P84_S4	Any of our clients may experience a downturn in their business that may weaken their results of operations and financial condition.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P84_S5	As a result, a client may fail to make payments when due, become insolvent or declare bankruptcy.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P84_S6	Any client bankruptcy or insolvency, or the failure of any client to make payments when due, could result in losses to our company.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P84_S7	A client bankruptcy would delay or preclude full collection of amounts owed to us.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P84_S8	Additionally, certain occupier outsourcing and property management client agreements require that we advance payroll and other vendor costs on behalf of clients.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P84_S9	If such a client were to file bankruptcy or otherwise fail, we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for those costs or for the severance obligations we would incur as a result of the loss of the client.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P84_S10	The bankruptcy or insolvency of a significant counterparty (which may include co-brokers, lenders, insurance companies, hedging counterparties, service providers or other organizations with which we do business), or the failure of any significant counterparty to perform its contractual commitments, may result in disruption to our business or material losses to our company.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P84_S11	Failure to maintain the security of our information and technology networks, including personally identifiable and client information, could adversely affect us.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P84_S12	Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P85_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and intellectual property, and that of our clients and personally identifiable information of our employees and contractors, in our data centers and on our networks.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P85_S1	The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information are critical to our operations.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P85_S2	Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P85_S3	A significant actual or potential theft, loss, fraudulent use or misuse of client, employee or other personally identifiable data, whether by third parties or as a result of employee malfeasance or otherwise, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could result in significant costs, fines, litigation or regulatory actions against us.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P85_S4	Such an event could additionally disrupt our operations and the services we provide to clients, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our services, which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P85_S5	Additionally, we increasingly rely on third-party data storage providers, including cloud storage solution providers, resulting in less direct control over our data.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P85_S6	Such third parties may also be vulnerable to security breaches and compromised security systems, which could adversely affect us and our reputation.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P85_S7	Interruption or failure of our information technology, communications systems or data services could impair our ability to effectively provide our services, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P85_S8	Our business requires the continued operation of information technology and communication systems and network infrastructure.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P85_S9	Our ability to conduct our global business may be adversely affected by disruptions to these systems or infrastructure.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P86_S0	damage or disruption from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, system malfunctions, computer viruses, cyber attacks, natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and floods, acts of war or terrorism, or other events which are beyond our control.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P86_S1	In addition, the operation and maintenance of these systems and networks is in some cases dependent on third-party technologies, systems and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P86_S2	Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data or intellectual property and may also disrupt our ability to provide services to or interact with our clients, and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication or travel.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P86_S3	We have disaster recovery plans and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events, but our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient and cannot account for all eventualities, and a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations, and as a result, our future operating results could be adversely affected.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P86_S4	The infrastructure disruptions we describe above may also disrupt our ability to manage real estate for clients or may adversely affect the value of real estate investments we make on behalf of clients.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P87_S0	The buildings we manage for clients, which include some of the world s largest office properties and retail centers, are used by numerous people daily.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P87_S1	As a result, fires, earthquakes, floods, other natural disasters, defects and terrorist attacks can result in significant loss of life, and, to the extent we are held to have been negligent in connection with our management of the affected properties, we could incur significant financial liabilities and reputational harm.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P88_S0	Our business relies significantly on the use of commercial real estate data.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P88_S1	We produce much of this data internally, but a significant portion is purchased from third-party providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P88_S2	A disruption of our ability to provide data to our professionals and/or our clients could damage our reputation, and our operating results could be adversely affected.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P88_S3	We are subject to substantial litigation risks and may face significant liabilities and/or damage to our professional reputation as a result of litigation allegations and negative publicity.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P88_S4	As a licensed real estate broker, we and our licensed employees are subject to regulatory due diligence, disclosure and standard-of-care obligations.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P88_S5	Failure to fulfill these obligations could subject us or our employees to litigation from parties who purchased, sold or leased properties that we or they brokered or managed.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P88_S6	We could become subject to claims by participants in real estate sales, as well as building owners and companies for whom we provide management services, alleging that we did not fulfill our regulatory and fiduciary obligations.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P89_S0	In addition, in our property management business, we hire and supervise third-party contractors to provide construction services for our managed properties.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P89_S1	While our role is limited to that of an agent for the owner, we may be subject to claims for construction defects or other similar actions.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P89_S2	The advice and services we render in our financial and valuation advisory businesses, the investment decisions we make in our Global Investment Management business and the activities of our investment banking and investment management professionals for or on behalf of our clients may subject them and us to the risk of third-party litigation.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P89_S3	Such litigation may arise from client or investor dissatisfaction with the performance of our programs, differences between actual values and appraised values, and a variety of other litigation claims, including allegations that we improperly exercised judgment, discretion, control or influence over client investments or that we breached fiduciary duties to clients.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P89_S4	For example, in our valuation and appraisal business, if market dynamics lead to a reduction in the market value of properties we have previously appraised, we may be subject to a higher risk of claims, including conflicts of interest claims, based on the circumstances of valuations previously issued.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P90_S0	Our valuation and appraisal services involve transactions where the value of the transaction is much greater than the fees we generate.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P90_S1	As a result, the consequences of errors that lead to damages might be disproportionately large in relation to the fees generated in the event our contractual protections or our insurance coverage are inadequate to protect us fully.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P91_S0	To the extent investors in our programs suffer losses resulting from fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or other similar misconduct, investors may have remedies against us, our investment programs or funds or our employees under the federal securities law and state law.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P91_S1	Moreover, we are exposed to risks of litigation or investigation by investors and regulators relating to allegations of our having engaged in transactions involving conflicts of interest that were not properly addressed.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P91_S2	Although some of these litigation risks may be mitigated by the commercial insurance we maintain in amounts we believe are appropriate, in the event of a substantial loss, our commercial insurance coverage and/or self-insurance reserve levels might not be sufficient to pay the full damages, the scope of available coverage may not cover certain types of claims, or such insurance may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P91_S3	Further, the value of otherwise valid claims we hold under insurance policies could become uncollectible in the event of the covering insurance company s insolvency, notwithstanding that we seek to limit this risk by placing our commercial insurance only with highly-rated companies.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P91_S4	Any of these events could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P91_S5	We depend on our business relationships and our reputation for integrity and high-caliber professional services to attract and retain clients across our overall business, as well as investors for our Global Investment Management business.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P91_S6	As a result, allegations by private litigants or regulators of conflicts of interest or improper conduct by us, whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us, as well as negative publicity and press speculation about us or our investment activities, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and damage our business prospects both in our Global Investment Management business and our other global businesses.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P91_S7	In addition, if any lawsuits were brought against us and resulted in a finding of substantial legal liability, it could materially, adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us, which could materially impact our business.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P91_S8	A failure to appropriately deal with actual or perceived conflicts of interest could adversely affect our businesses.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P91_S9	Our company has a global platform with different business lines and a broad client base and is therefore subject to numerous potential, actual or perceived conflicts of interests in the provision of services to our existing and potential clients.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P91_S10	For example, conflicts may arise from our position as broker to both owners and tenants in commercial real estate lease transactions.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P91_S11	We have adopted various policies, controls and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts, but these policies and procedures may not be adequate and may not be adhered to by our employees.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P91_S12	Appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged and cause us to lose existing clients or fail to gain new clients if we fail, or appear to fail, to identify, disclose and manage potential conflicts of interest, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P91_S13	In addition, it is possible that in some jurisdictions regulations could be changed to limit our ability to act for parties where conflicts exist even with informed consent, which could limit our market share in those markets.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P92_S0	There can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P92_S1	Our joint venture activities and affiliate program involve unique risks that are often outside of our control and that, if realized, could harm our business.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P92_S2	We have utilized joint ventures for commercial investments and local brokerage and other affiliations both in the United States and internationally, and we may acquire minority interests in other joint ventures in the future.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P93_S0	Under our affiliate program, we enter into contractual relationships with local brokerage, property management or other operations pursuant to which we license our name and make available certain of our resources, in exchange for economic participation in transactional activity.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P93_S1	In many of these joint ventures and affiliations, we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures or affiliates, and other participants or operators of affiliates may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P94_S0	have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P94_S1	If a joint venture participant or affiliate acts contrary to our interest, it could harm our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P95_S0	We have numerous significant competitors and potential future competitors, some of which may have greater financial and operational resources than we do.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P95_S1	We compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate services industry, including commercial property and corporate facilities management, occupier and property/agency leasing, property sales, valuation, real estate investment management, commercial mortgage origination and servicing, capital markets (structured finance and debt) solutions, development services and proprietary research.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P95_S2	Although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2013 revenue, our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies, property types and services and business lines.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P95_S3	Depending on the geography, property type or service or business line, we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers and investment firms, including outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have recently expanded their offerings, in-house corporate real estate departments, developers, institutional lenders, insurance companies, investment banking firms, investment managers, and accounting and consulting firms.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P95_S4	Some of these firms may have greater financial resources than we do.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P95_S5	In addition, future changes in laws could lead to the entry of other competitors, such as financial institutions.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P95_S6	Although many of our competitors are local or regional firms and are substantially smaller than us, some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P95_S7	We are also subject to competition from other large national and multi-national firms that have similar service and investment competencies to ours.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P95_S8	It is also possible that two or more of our competitors could combine to create a much larger and more formidable global competitor.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P95_S9	In general, there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively, to maintain current fee levels or margins, or maintain or increase our market share.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P95_S10	A significant portion of our operations are concentrated in California and our business could be harmed if there was an economic downturn in the California real estate markets.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P95_S11	During 2013, approximately 10% of our revenue was generated from transactions originating in California.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P96_S0	As a result of the geographic concentration in California, economic downturns in the California commercial real estate market, similar to recent downturns experienced in California, and particularly in the local economies in Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties, could harm our results of operations and disproportionately affect our business as compared to competitors who have less or different geographic concentrations.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P97_S0	We operate in many jurisdictions with complex and varied tax regimes.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P97_S1	Changes in tax rules or the outcome of tax assessments and audits could adversely affect our results.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P98_S0	We operate in many jurisdictions with complex and varied tax regimes, and are subject to different forms of taxation resulting in a variable effective tax rate.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P98_S1	In addition, from time to time we engage in transactions that involve different tax jurisdictions.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P99_S0	Due to the different tax laws in the many jurisdictions where we operate, we are often required to make subjective determinations.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P99_S1	The tax authorities in the various jurisdictions where we carry on business may not agree with the determinations that are made by us with respect to the application of tax law.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P99_S2	Such disagreements could result in disputes and, ultimately, in the payment of additional funds to the government authorities of foreign and local jurisdictions where we carry on business, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P99_S3	In addition, changes in tax rules or the outcome of tax assessments and audits could have an adverse effect on our results in any particular quarter.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P100_S0	Our estimate of tax related assets, liabilities, recoveries and expenses incorporates assumptions.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P100_S1	These assumptions include, but are not limited to, the tax laws in various jurisdictions, the effect of tax treaties between jurisdictions, taxable income projections, and the benefits of various restructuring plans.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P100_S2	To the extent that such assumptions differ from actual results, we may have to record additional income tax expenses and liabilities.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P101_S0	We are subject to the possibility of loss contingencies arising out of tax claims, assessments related to uncertain tax positions and provisions for specifically identified income tax exposures.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P101_S1	There are currently tax audits ongoing in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P101_S2	There can be no assurance that we will be successful in resolving potential tax claims that arise from these audits.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P101_S3	Although we have recorded provisions on the basis of the best current understanding, we could be required to book additional provisions in future periods for amounts that cannot be assessed at this stage.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P101_S4	Our failure to do so and/or the need to increase our provisions for such claims could have an adverse effect on our financial position.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P101_S5	If the assets in our defined benefit pension plans are not sufficient to meet the plans obligations, we may be required to make cash contributions to it and our liquidity may be adversely affected.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P102_S0	Our subsidiaries based in the United Kingdom maintain two contributory defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in the plans.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P102_S1	With respect to these plans, our historical policy has been to contribute annually, an amount to fund pension cost as actuarially determined and as required by applicable laws and regulations.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P102_S2	Our contributions to these plans are invested and, if these investments do not perform in the future as well as we expect, we will be required to provide additional funding to cover any shortfall.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P102_S3	The underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans included in pension liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, which are incorporated herein by reference, was $68.0 million and $63.5 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P102_S4	If the assets in our defined benefit pension plans continue to be insufficient to meet the plans obligations, we may be required to make substantial cash contributions preventing the use of such cash for other purposes and adversely affecting our liquidity.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P102_S5	If we fail to maintain and protect our intellectual property, or infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, our business could be harmed and we could incur financial penalties.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P102_S6	Our business depends, in part, on our ability to identify and protect proprietary information and other intellectual property (such as our service marks, client lists and information, business methods and research).
1138118_14_ITEM1_P102_S7	Existing laws, or the application of those laws, of some countries in which we operate may offer only limited protections for our intellectual property rights.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P102_S8	We rely on a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality policies, non-disclosure and other contractual arrangements, and on copyright, trademark and other intellectual property laws to protect our intellectual property rights.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P102_S9	Our inability to detect unauthorized use or take appropriate or timely steps to enforce our rights may have an adverse effect on our business.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P102_S10	We cannot be sure that the intellectual property that we may use in the course of operating our business or the services we offer to clients does not infringe on the rights of third parties, and we may have infringement claims asserted against us or against our clients.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P102_S11	These claims may harm our reputation, cost us money and prevent us from offering some services.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P103_S0	Confidential intellectual property is increasingly stored or carried on mobile devices, such as laptop computers, which makes inadvertent disclosure more of a risk in the event the mobile devices are lost or stolen and the information has not been adequately safeguarded or encrypted.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P104_S0	Our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected by new laws or regulations or by changes in existing laws or regulations or the application thereof.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P104_S1	If we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us, including in our role as a real estate broker, registered investment advisor, mortgage broker, property/facility manager or developer, we may incur significant financial penalties.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P104_S2	We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations specific to the services we perform in our business.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P104_S3	Brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions and the provision of property management and valuation services require us to maintain applicable licenses in each U.S. state and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we perform these services.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P105_S0	activities without a license, or violate any of the regulations covering our licenses, we may be required to pay fines (including treble damages in certain states) or return commissions received or have our licenses suspended or revoked.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P105_S1	A number of our services, including the services provided by our indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, CBRE Capital Markets and CBRE Global Investors, are subject to regulation by the SEC, FINRA or other self-regulatory organizations and state securities regulators and compliance failures or regulatory action could adversely affect our business.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P105_S2	We could be subject to disciplinary or other actions in the future due to claimed noncompliance with these regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P105_S3	We are also subject to laws of broader applicability, such as tax, securities, environmental and employment laws, including the Fair Labor Standards Act, occupational health and safety regulations and state wage-and-hour laws.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P105_S4	Failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of significant fines by governmental authorities, awards of damages to private litigants and significant amounts paid in legal fees or settlements of these matters.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P106_S0	As the size and scope of our business has increased significantly during the past several years, both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with numerous licensing and other regulatory requirements and the possible loss resulting from non-compliance have increased.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P106_S1	The global economic crisis has resulted in increased government and legislative activities, including the introduction of new legislation and changes to rules and regulations, which we expect will continue into the future.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P106_S2	New or revised legislation or regulations applicable to our business, both within and outside of the United States, as well as changes in administrations or enforcement priorities may have an adverse effect on our business, including increasing the costs of regulatory compliance or preventing us from providing certain types of services in certain jurisdictions or in connection with certain transactions or clients.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P106_S3	We are unable to predict how any of these new laws, rules, regulations and proposals will be implemented or in what form, or whether any additional or similar changes to laws or regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, will occur in the future.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P106_S4	Any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P107_S0	We may be subject to environmental liability as a result of our role as a property or facility manager or developer of real estate.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P108_S0	Various laws and regulations impose liability on real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating, cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P108_S1	In our role as a property or facility manager or developer, we could be held liable as an operator for such costs.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P108_S2	This liability may be imposed without regard to the legality of the original actions and without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P108_S3	If we fail to disclose environmental issues, we could also be liable to a buyer or lessee of a property.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P108_S4	If we incur any such liability, our business could suffer significantly as it could be difficult for us to develop or sell such properties, or borrow funds using such properties as collateral.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P108_S5	In the event of a substantial liability, our insurance coverage might be insufficient to pay the full damages, or the scope of available coverage may not cover certain of these liabilities.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P108_S6	Additionally, liabilities incurred to comply with more stringent future environmental requirements could adversely affect any or all of our lines of business.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P109_S0	This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P109_S1	The words anticipate, believe, could, should, propose, continue, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, predict, project, will and similar terms and phrases are used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to identify forward-looking statements.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P109_S2	Except for historical information contained herein, the matters addressed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking statements.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P110_S0	based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P110_S1	These statements also relate to our future prospects, developments and business strategies.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P110_S2	These forward-looking statements are made based on our management s expectations and beliefs concerning future events affecting us and are subject to uncertainties and factors relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P110_S3	These uncertainties and factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those matters expressed in or implied by these forward-looking statements.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P110_S4	The following factors are among those, but are not only those, that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements:
1138118_14_ITEM1_P111_S0	the other factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, included under the headings Risk Factors , Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk or as described in the other documents and reports we file with the SEC.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P112_S0	Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P112_S1	You should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P112_S2	We assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking information, except to the extent required by applicable securities laws.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P112_S3	If we do update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.
1138118_14_ITEM1_P112_S4	Additional information concerning these and other risks and uncertainties is contained in our other periodic filings with the SEC.
1138118_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	of December 31, 2013: Some of our offices that contain employees of our Global Investment Management or our Development Services segments also contain employees of our other business segments.
1138118_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	Often, the employees of these segments occupy separate suites in the same building in order to operate the businesses independently with standalone offices.
1138118_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	We have provided above office totals by geographic region and not listed all of our Global Investment Management and Development Services offices to avoid double counting.
1138118_14_ITEM2_P1_S1	In general, these leased offices are fully utilized.
1138118_14_ITEM2_P2_S0	The most significant terms of the leasing arrangements for our offices are the length of the lease and the rent.
1138118_14_ITEM2_P2_S1	Our leases have terms varying in duration.
1138118_14_ITEM2_P2_S2	The rent payable under our office leases varies significantly from location to location as a result of differences in prevailing commercial real estate rates in different geographic locations.
1138118_14_ITEM2_P3_S0	Our management believes that no single office lease is material to our business, results of operations or financial condition.
1138118_14_ITEM2_P3_S1	In addition, we believe there is adequate alternative office space available at acceptable rental rates to meet our needs, although adverse movements in rental rates in some markets may negatively affect our profits in those markets when we enter into new leases.
1138118_14_ITEM2_P3_S2	We do not own any offices, which is consistent with our strategy to lease instead of own.
1138118_14_ITEM2_P3_S3	Legal Proceedings We are a party to a number of pending or threatened lawsuits arising out of, or incident to, our ordinary course of business.
1138118_14_ITEM2_P3_S4	Our management believes that any losses in excess of the amounts accrued arising from such lawsuits are remote, but that litigation is inherently uncertain and there is the potential for a material adverse effect on our financial statements if one or more matters are resolved in a particular period in an amount in excess of that anticipated by management.
1138118_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	the last two fiscal years, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange, are set forth below for the periods indicated.
1138118_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	The closing share price for our Class A common stock on December 31, 2013, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange, was $26.30.
1138118_14_ITEM5_P1_S1	As of February 14, 2014, there were 298 stockholders of record of our Class A common stock.
1138118_14_ITEM5_P1_S2	We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on any class of our common stock since our inception on February 20, 2001, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.
1138118_14_ITEM5_P1_S3	We currently intend to retain any future earnings to reduce debt and finance future growth.
1138118_14_ITEM5_P1_S4	Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors that the board of directors deems relevant.
1138118_14_ITEM5_P1_S5	In addition, our ability to declare and pay cash dividends is restricted by the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility and senior secured term loan facilities.
1138118_14_ITEM5_P1_S6	Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities On December 23, 2013, we issued an aggregate of 362,916 shares of non-vested Class A common stock to certain members of senior management of Norland Managed Services Ltd (Norland) in connection with our acquisition of Norland.
1138118_14_ITEM5_P1_S7	These shares may not be directly or indirectly transferred until December 2018 and are subject to forfeiture if the holder thereof terminates employment with us prior to such date (with certain exceptions).
1138118_14_ITEM5_P2_S0	These securities qualified for exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, or the Securities Act, since the issuance of securities by us did not involve a public offering.
1138118_14_ITEM5_P2_S1	The offering was not a public offering as defined in Section 4(2) due to the number of persons involved in the transaction, size of the offering, manner of the offering and number of securities offered.
1138118_14_ITEM5_P2_S2	In addition, these shareholders had the necessary investment intent as required by Section 4(2) since they agreed to and received share certificates bearing a legend stating that such securities are restricted pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act.
1138118_14_ITEM5_P2_S3	This restriction ensures that these securities would not be immediately redistributed into the market and therefore not be part of a public offering.
1138118_14_ITEM5_P2_S4	Based on an analysis of the above factors, we have met the requirements to qualify for exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act for this transaction.
1138118_14_ITEM5_P3_S0	Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities None.

1138118_14_ITEM6_P2_S0	(1) In 2011, we acquired the majority of the real estate investment management business of Netherlands-based ING Group N.V. (ING).
1138118_14_ITEM6_P2_S1	The acquisitions included substantially all of ING s Real Estate Investment Management (REIM) operations in Europe and Asia as well as substantially all of Clarion Real Estate Securities (CRES), its U.S.-based global real estate listed securities business (collectively referred to as ING REIM) along with certain CRES co-investments from ING and additional interests in other funds managed by ING REIM Europe and ING REIM Asia.
1138118_14_ITEM6_P2_S2	On July 1, 2011, we completed the acquisition of CRES for $332.8 million and CRES co-investments from ING for an aggregate amount of $58.6 million.
1138118_14_ITEM6_P2_S3	On October 3, 2011, we completed the acquisition of ING REIM Asia for $45.3 million and three ING REIM Asia co-investments from ING for an aggregate amount of $13.9 million.
1138118_14_ITEM6_P2_S4	On October 31, 2011, we completed the acquisition of ING REIM Europe for $441.5 million and one co-investment from ING for $7.4 million.
1138118_14_ITEM6_P2_S5	During the year ended December 31, 2012, we also funded nine additional co-investments for an aggregate amount of $34.5 million related to ING REIM Europe.
1138118_14_ITEM6_P2_S6	The results for the year ended December 31, 2011 include the operations of CRES, ING REIM Asia and ING REIM Europe from July 1, 2011, October 3, 2011 and October 31, 2011, respectively, the dates each respective business was acquired.
1138118_14_ITEM6_P3_S0	(2) EPS represents earnings per share.
1138118_14_ITEM6_P3_S1	See Earnings Per Share information in Note 18 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_14_ITEM6_P4_S0	EBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.
1138118_14_ITEM6_P4_S1	Our management believes EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions.
1138118_14_ITEM6_P4_S2	Such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.
1138118_14_ITEM6_P4_S3	As a result, our management uses EBITDA as a measure to evaluate the operating performance of our various business segments and for other discretionary purposes, including as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive programs.
1138118_14_ITEM6_P4_S4	Additionally, we believe EBITDA is useful to investors to assist them in getting a more complete picture of our results from operations.
1138118_14_ITEM6_P4_S5	However, EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under GAAP and when analyzing our operating performance, readers should use EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP.
1138118_14_ITEM6_P4_S6	Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
1138118_14_ITEM6_P4_S7	Furthermore, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management s discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.
1138118_14_ITEM6_P4_S8	The amounts shown for EBITDA also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
1138118_14_ITEM6_P5_S0	EBITDA is calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_14_ITEM6_P6_S0	(4) Notes payable on real estate disclosed here includes the current and long-term portions of notes payable on real estate as well as notes payable included in liabilities related to real estate and other assets held for sale.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	We are the world s largest commercial real estate services and investment firm, based on 2013 revenue, with leading full-service operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	We offer a full range of services to occupiers, owners, lenders and investors in office, retail, industrial, multifamily and other types of commercial real estate.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P0_S2	As of December 31, 2013, excluding independent affiliates, we operated in approximately 350 offices worldwide, with approximately 44,000 employees providing commercial real estate services under the CBRE brand name, investment management services under the CBRE Global Investors brand name and development services under the Trammell Crow brand name.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P0_S3	Our business is focused on several competencies, including commercial property and corporate facilities management, tenant/occupier and property/agency leasing, property sales, real estate investment management, valuation, commercial mortgage origination and servicing, capital markets (structured finance and debt) solutions, development services and proprietary research.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P0_S4	We generate revenue from management fees on a contractual and per-project basis, and from commissions on transactions.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P0_S5	In 2013, we were the highest ranked commercial real estate services company among the Fortune Most Admired Companies, and were also named the Global Real Estate Advisor of the Year by Euromoney .
1138118_14_ITEM7_P0_S6	We have been the only commercial real estate services company included in the S P 500 since 2006, and in the Fortune 500 since 2008.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P0_S7	Additionally, the International Association of Outsourcing Professionals has included us among the top 100 global outsourcing companies across all industries for eight consecutive years, including in 2013 when we ranked fourth overall and were the highest ranked commercial real estate services company.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	When you read our financial statements and the information included in this section, you should consider that we have experienced, and continue to experience, several material trends and uncertainties that have affected our financial condition and results of operations that make it challenging to predict our future performance based on our historical results.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	We believe that the following material trends and uncertainties are crucial to an understanding of the variability in our historical earnings and cash flows and the potential for continued variability in the future: Macroeconomic Conditions Economic trends and government policies affect global and regional commercial real estate markets as well as our operations directly.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P1_S2	These include: overall economic activity and employment growth, interest rate levels, the cost and availability of credit and the impact of tax and regulatory policies.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P1_S3	Periods of economic weakness or recession, significantly rising interest rates, fiscal uncertainty, declining employment levels, decreasing demand for commercial real estate, falling real estate values, disruption to the global capital or credit markets, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, may negatively affect the performance of some or all of our business lines.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P1_S4	The severe global economic downturn and financial market crisis in 2008 and 2009 had significant adverse effects on our operations, materially lowering both our fees from property and facilities management and valuations, and our commissions from property sales, leasing and financing, as well as reducing the funds available to invest in commercial real estate and related assets.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	Commercial real estate markets have been gradually recovering since 2010 in step with the slow improvement in global economic activity.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	During the economic downturn and financial market crisis, weak economic conditions also affected our compensation expense, which is structured to generally decrease in line with a fall in revenue.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P2_S2	Compensation is our largest expense and the sales and leasing professionals in our largest line of business, advisory services, generally are paid on a commission and bonus basis that correlates with their revenue production.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P2_S3	As a result, the negative effect of difficult market conditions on our operating margins was partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P2_S4	In addition, when negative economic conditions are particularly severe, as they were in 2008 and 2009, we have moved decisively to lower operating expenses to improve financial performance.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	past four years, we have restored certain expenses.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	Notwithstanding the gradual market recovery, challenges to the macro economy remain, and a return of adverse global and regional economic trends is one of the most significant risks to the performance of our operations and our financial condition.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	The global capital markets disruption in late 2008 caused a significant and prolonged decline in property sales, leasing, financing and investment activity that adversely affected all our business lines.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	Commercial real estate fundamentals began to stabilize in early 2010 and have steadily improved for the past four years, most significantly in the United States.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P4_S2	Reflecting a slow economic recovery, vacancy rates and rental rates in the United States have improved modestly and steadily, while the increased availability of low-cost credit and improved investor sentiment have sustained increases in property sales activity.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P4_S3	Overall, however, occupiers and investors have remained cautious and both sales and leasing activity continue to be well below the peak levels experienced in 2006 and 2007.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	In Europe, commercial real estate markets have been slower to recover than in the United States, due to the sovereign-debt crisis, which brought on a double dip recession.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	The European economies began to emerge from recession in 2013, with most countries returning to positive, though modest, economic growth.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	Reflecting the macro environment, investment sales across much of Europe were tepid from 2011 through late 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P6_S2	Sales activity began to improve in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the recovery continued in 2013.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P6_S3	However, leasing activity has remained slow, and rents essentially flat, across many major markets in Europe, as occupiers have been reluctant to make long-term space commitments.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	Following the global financial crisis, real estate transaction activities in Asia Pacific revived significantly from late 2009 through late 2011.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	However, leasing activity has been subdued since then, as multi-national corporations, in particular, have been hesitant to expand in the region.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P7_S2	On the other hand, investment activity improved in 2013, following a softening in 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P7_S3	Real estate investment management and property development activity were also adversely affected by the global financial crisis, which lowered property values, and constrained financing and disposition opportunities.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P7_S4	However, the macro environment for these businesses has generally improved as the real estate credit and investment sales markets have gradually recovered since 2010.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P7_S5	The further recovery of our global sales, leasing, investment management and development services operations depends on the continued improvement of market fundamentals, including stronger economic growth and job creation; stable, healthy global credit markets; and improved business and investor sentiment.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	Effects of Acquisitions Our management historically has made significant use of strategic acquisitions to add new service competencies, to increase our scale within existing competencies and to expand our presence in various geographic regions around the world.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	In 2013, we fortified our real estate outsourcing platform in Europe within our EMEA segment with the acquisition of London-based Norland Managed Services, Ltd. (Norland) for approximately $475 million (the Norland Acquisition).
1138118_14_ITEM7_P8_S2	Norland is a premier provider of building technical engineering services that enables us to self-perform these services in Europe and adds to our expertise in the highly specialized critical environments market.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	In 2011, we acquired the majority of the real estate investment management business of Netherlands-based ING Group N.V. (ING) for a total purchase price of approximately $878 million, which bolstered our global real estate investment management business and further diversified our service offerings.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	The acquisitions of the former ING real estate management businesses (collectively referred to as the REIM Acquisitions) included substantially all of ING s Real Estate Investment Management (REIM) operations in Europe and Asia, as well as substantially all of Clarion Real Estate Securities (CRES), its U.S.-based global real estate listed securities business, along with certain CRES co-investments from ING and additional interests in other funds managed by ING REIM Europe and ING REIM Asia.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	Strategic in-fill acquisitions have also played a key role in expanding our geographic coverage and broadening and strengthening our service offerings.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	The companies we acquired have generally been quality regional or specialty firms that complement our existing platform within a region, or affiliates in which, in some cases, we held a small equity interest.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P10_S2	During 2013, we completed ten in-fill acquisitions, most notably a leading firm serving the London prime residential real estate market, a leading regional commercial real estate services firm based in San Francisco, a retail real estate services firm in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region, a facility consulting and project advisory firm serving the healthcare industry and based in Richmond, Virginia, and two property management specialist firms one in the Czech Republic and Slovakia and one in Belgium.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P10_S3	During 2012, we completed five in-fill acquisitions, including our former affiliate companies in Turkey and Vietnam, a niche real estate investment advisor and an independent commercial and residential property partnership in the United Kingdom, and a brokerage and property management firm in Atlanta, Georgia.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P10_S4	In 2011, we completed five in-fill acquisitions, including a valuation business in Australia, a retail property management business in central and eastern Europe, our former affiliate company in Switzerland, a retail services business in the United Kingdom and a shopping center management business in the Netherlands.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	Although our management believes that strategic acquisitions can significantly decrease the cost, time and commitment of management resources necessary to attain a meaningful competitive position within targeted markets or to expand our presence within our current markets, in general, most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating and net income, both as a result of transaction-related expenditures, which include severance, lease termination, transaction and deferred financing costs, among others, and the charges and costs of integrating the acquired business and its financial and accounting systems into our own.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	For example, through December 31, 2013, we incurred $111.8 million of transaction-related expenditures and integration costs in connection with the REIM Acquisitions.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	International Operations As we increase our international operations through either acquisitions or organic growth, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	Our management team generally seeks to mitigate our exposure by balancing assets and liabilities that are denominated in the same currency and by maintaining cash positions outside the United States only at levels necessary for operating purposes.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	In addition, from time to time we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to attempt to mitigate some of our exposure to exchange rate changes related to particular transactions and to hedge risks associated with the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	Our Global Investment Management business has a significant amount of Euro-denominated assets under management, or AUM, as well as associated revenue and earnings in Europe, which has seen continuing sovereign debt issues resulting in a more pronounced movement in the value of the Euro against the U.S. dollar.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have resulted and may continue to result in corresponding fluctuations in our AUM, revenue and earnings.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P13_S2	Due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P13_S3	In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P13_S4	Our international operations also are subject to, among other things, political instability and changing regulatory environments, which may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P13_S5	Our management routinely monitors these risks and related costs and evaluates the appropriate amount of resources to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	Leverage We are leveraged and have significant debt service obligations.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	As of December 31, 2013, our total debt, excluding our notes payable on real estate (which are generally nonrecourse to us) and warehouse lines of credit (which are recourse only to our wholly-owned subsidiary, CBRE Capital Markets, Inc., or CBRE Capital Markets, and are secured by our related warehouse receivables), was approximately $2.0 billion.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P14_S2	Our level of indebtedness and the operating and financial restrictions in our debt agreements place some constraints on the operation of our business.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P14_S3	Although our management believes that long-term indebtedness has been an important lever in the development of our business, including facilitating the REIM Acquisitions and the Norland Acquisition, the cash flow necessary to service this debt is not available for other general corporate purposes, which may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in the commercial real estate services industry.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P14_S4	Our management seeks to mitigate this exposure both through the refinancing of debt when available on attractive terms and through selective repayment and retirement of indebtedness.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P14_S5	For example, during 2013, we completed a series of financing transactions that have meaningfully extended debt maturities, lowered annual interest expense by approximately $50 million when compared to annualized interest expense before these refinancing actions, and increased our financial flexibility.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P14_S6	These transactions included the amendment and restatement of our credit agreement, which now provides for a $715.0 million term loan facility and an expanded $1.2 billion revolving credit facility (of which $142.5 million was drawn at December 31, 2013), the issuance of $800.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior notes due March 15, 2023 and the redemption of all of the 11.625% senior subordinated notes totaling $450.0 million.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P14_S7	During the year ended December 31, 2013, in connection with all of these financing activities, we incurred approximately $28.6 million of financing costs, of which $3.6 million was expensed.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P14_S8	In addition, we expensed $17.8 million of previously-deferred financing costs as well as a $26.2 million early extinguishment premium and $8.7 million of unamortized original issue discount associated with the 11.625% senior subordinated notes.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that management believes to be reasonable.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P15_S2	Actual results may differ from those estimates.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P15_S3	We believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
1138118_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	Revenue Recognition In order for us to recognize revenue, there are four basic criteria that must be met:
1138118_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	Our revenue recognition policies are consistent with these criteria.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	The judgments involved in revenue recognition include understanding the complex terms of agreements and determining the appropriate time to recognize revenue for each transaction based on such terms.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	Each transaction is evaluated to determine: (i) at what point in time revenue is earned, (ii) whether contingencies exist that impact the timing of recognition of revenue and (iii) how and when such contingencies will be resolved.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P18_S2	The timing of revenue recognition could vary if different judgments were made.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P18_S3	Our revenues subject to the most judgment are brokerage commission revenue and incentive-based management and development fees.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	We record commission revenue on real estate sales generally upon close of escrow or transfer of title, except when future contingencies exist.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	Real estate commissions on leases are generally recorded in revenue when all obligations under the commission agreement are satisfied.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	Terms and conditions of a commission agreement may include, but are not limited to, execution of a signed lease agreement and future contingencies including tenant occupancy, payment of a deposit or payment of a first month s rent (or a combination thereof).
1138118_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	As some of these conditions are outside of our control and are often not clearly defined, judgment must be exercised in determining when such required events have occurred in order to recognize revenue.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	A typical commission agreement provides that we earn a portion of a lease commission upon the execution of the lease agreement by the tenant and landlord, with the remaining portion(s) of the lease commission earned at a later date, usually upon tenant occupancy or payment of rent.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	The existence of any significant future contingencies results in the delay of recognition of corresponding revenue until such contingencies are satisfied.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P21_S2	For example, if we do not earn all or a portion of the lease commission until the tenant pays its first month s rent, and the lease agreement provides the tenant with a free rent period, we delay revenue recognition until rent is paid by the tenant.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	Property management revenues are generally based upon percentages of the revenue or base rent generated by the entities managed or the square footage managed.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	These fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related management agreements.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	Investment management fees are based predominantly upon a percentage of the equity deployed on behalf of our limited partners.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	Fees related to our indirect investment management programs are based upon a percentage of the fair value of those investments.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P23_S2	These fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related investment management agreements.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P23_S3	Our Global Investment Management segment also earns performance-based incentive fees with regard to many of its investments.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P23_S4	Such revenue is recognized at the end of the measurement periods when the conditions of the applicable incentive fee arrangements have been satisfied and following the expiration of any potential claw back provision.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P23_S5	With many of these investments, our Global Investment Management professionals have participation interests in such incentive fees, which are commonly referred to as carried interest.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P23_S6	This carried interest expense is generally accrued for based upon the probability of such performance-based incentive fees being earned over the related vesting period.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P23_S7	In addition, our Global Investment Management segment also earns success-based transaction fees with regard to buying or selling properties on behalf of certain funds and separate accounts.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P23_S8	Such revenue is recognized at the completion of a successful transaction and is not subject to any claw back provision.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	We earn development and incentive development fees in our Development Services segment.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	Development fees are generally based on a percentage of a defined cost measure and are recognized at the lower of the amount billed or the amount determined on a straight-line basis over the development period.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P24_S2	Incentive development fees are recognized when quantitative criteria have been met (such as specified leasing or budget targets) or, for those incentive fees based on qualitative criteria, upon approval of the fee by our clients.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	Certain incentive development fees allow us to share in the fair value of the developed real estate asset above cost.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	This sharing creates additional revenue potential to us with no exposure to loss other than opportunity cost.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P25_S2	Our incentive development fee revenue is not recognized to the extent that such revenue is subject to future performance contingencies, but rather once the contingency has been resolved.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P25_S3	The unique nature and complexity of each incentive fee requires us to use varying levels of judgment in determining the timing of revenue recognition.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	In establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables, we make assumptions with respect to future collectability.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	Our assumptions are based on an assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends, including the aging of receivables balances.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P26_S2	In addition to these assessments, in general, outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are more than 180 days overdue are evaluated for collectability and fully provided for if deemed uncollectible.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	Historically, our credit losses have generally been insignificant.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	However, estimating losses requires significant judgment, and conditions may change or new information may become known after any periodic evaluation.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P27_S2	As a result, actual credit losses may differ from our estimates.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majority-owned subsidiaries, as well as variable interest entities, or VIEs, in which we are the primary beneficiary.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	The equity attributable to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries is shown separately in our consolidated balance sheets included elsewhere in this report.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P28_S2	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	Variable Interest Entities As required by the Consolidations Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, or Topic 810, we consolidate all VIEs in which we are the entity s primary beneficiary.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P29_S1	A reporting entity is determined to be the primary beneficiary if it holds a controlling financial interest in the VIE.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P29_S2	(2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from such entity that could potentially be significant to such entity.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P29_S3	The entity which satisfies these criteria is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	We determine if an entity is a VIE based on several factors, including whether the entity s total equity investment at risk upon inception is sufficient to finance the entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	We make judgments regarding the sufficiency of the equity at risk based first on a qualitative analysis, then a quantitative analysis, if necessary.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	We analyze any investments in VIEs to determine if we are the primary beneficiary.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	We consider a variety of factors in identifying the entity that holds the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance including, but not limited to, the ability to direct financing, leasing, construction and other operating decisions and activities.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P31_S2	In addition, we consider the rights of other investors to participate in those decisions, to replace the manager and to sell or liquidate the entity.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P31_S3	We also have several co-investments in real estate investment funds which qualify for a deferral of the qualitative approach for analyzing potential VIEs.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P31_S4	We continue to analyze these investments under the former quantitative method incorporating various estimates, including estimated future cash flows, asset hold periods and discount rates, as well as estimates of the probabilities of various scenarios occurring.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	If the entity is a VIE, we then determine whether we consolidate the entity as the primary beneficiary.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P32_S1	This determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary includes any impact of an upside economic interest in the form of a promote that we may have.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	A promote is an interest built into the distribution structure of the entity based on the entity s achievement of certain return hurdles.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	We consolidate any VIE of which we are the primary beneficiary (see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report) and disclose significant VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary, if any, as well as disclose our maximum exposure to loss related to VIEs that are not consolidated.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	We determine whether an entity is a VIE and, if so, whether it should be consolidated by utilizing judgments and estimates that are inherently subjective.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P34_S2	If an entity is not a VIE, our determination of the appropriate accounting method with respect to our investments in limited partnerships, limited liability companies and other subsidiaries is based on voting control.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P34_S3	For our general partner interests, we are presumed to control (and therefore consolidate) the entity, unless the other limited partners have substantive rights that overcome this presumption of control.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	decisions made in the ordinary course of the entity s business.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	We account for our non-controlling general partner investments in these entities under the equity method.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P35_S2	This treatment also applies to our managing member interests in limited liability companies.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P35_S3	Our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, but do not control, or entities which are variable interest entities in which we are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for under the equity method.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P35_S4	Accordingly, our share of the earnings from these equity-method basis companies is included in consolidated net income.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P35_S5	All other investments held on a long-term basis are valued at cost less any impairment in value.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	Our determination of the appropriate accounting treatment for an investment in a subsidiary requires judgment of several factors, including the size and nature of our ownership interest and the other owners substantive rights to make decisions for the entity.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	If we were to make different judgments or conclusions as to the level of our control or influence, it could result in a different accounting treatment.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P36_S2	Accounting for an investment as either consolidated or using the equity method generally would have no impact on our net income or stockholders equity in any accounting period, but a different treatment would impact individual income statement and balance sheet items, as consolidation would effectively gross up our income statement and balance sheet.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P36_S3	If our evaluation of an investment accounted for using the cost method was different, it could result in our being required to account for an investment by consolidation or by the equity method.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	Under the cost method, the investor only records its share of the underlying entity s earnings to the extent that it receives dividends from the investee; when the dividends received by the investor exceed the investor s share of the investee s earnings subsequent to the date of the investor s investment, the investor records a reduction in the basis of its investment.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P37_S1	Under the cost method, the investor does not record its share of losses of the investee.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P37_S2	Conversely, under either consolidation or equity method accounting, the investor effectively records its share of the underlying entity s net income or loss, or its guarantees of the underlying entity s debt.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P37_S3	Under either the equity or cost method, impairment losses are recognized upon evidence of other-than-temporary losses of value.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	When testing for impairment on investments that are not actively traded on a public market, we generally use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our investments and/or look to comparable activities in the marketplace.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow approach.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P38_S2	These assumptions include net asset values, internal rates of return, discount and capitalization rates, interest rates and financing terms, rental rates, timing of leasing activity, estimates of lease terms and related concessions, etc.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P38_S3	When determining if impairment is other-than-temporary, we also look to the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been less than cost as well as the financial condition and near-term prospects of each investment.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting, which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	In determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, we use a variety of valuation methods including present value, depreciated replacement cost, market values (where available) and selling prices less costs to dispose.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	We are responsible for determining the valuation of assets and liabilities and for the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	Assumptions must often be made in determining fair values, particularly where observable market values do not exist.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	Assumptions may include discount rates, growth rates, cost of capital, royalty rates, tax rates and remaining useful lives.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P42_S2	These assumptions can have a significant impact on the value of identifiable assets and accordingly can impact the value of goodwill recorded.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P42_S3	Different assumptions could result in different values being attributed to assets and liabilities.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P42_S4	Since these values impact the amount of annual depreciation and amortization expense, different assumptions could also impact our statement of operations and could impact the results of future impairment reviews.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	The majority of our goodwill balance has resulted from our acquisition of CBRE Services, Inc, or CBRE, in 2001 (the 2001 Acquisition), our acquisition of Insignia Financial Group, Inc., or Insignia, in 2003 (the Insignia Acquisition), the Trammell Crow Company Acquisition in 2006, the REIM Acquisitions in 2011 and the Norland Acquisition in 2013.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	Other intangible assets that have indefinite estimated useful lives and are not being amortized include certain management contracts identified in the REIM Acquisitions, a trademark, which was separately identified as a result of the 2001 Acquisition, and a trade name separately identified as a result of the REIM Acquisitions.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P43_S2	The remaining other intangible assets primarily include customer relationships, management contracts and loan servicing rights, which are all being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging up to 20 years.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P43_S3	We are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	The goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step process.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	The first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	We use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P45_S2	Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P45_S3	These assumptions include revenue growth rates, profit margin percentages, discount rates, etc.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered to not be impaired.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	The second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	The implied fair value of goodwill is determined similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination, by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one, over the estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P47_S2	Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business s fair value and the relative size of our goodwill, if different assumptions and estimates were used, it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	Our annual assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives has historically been completed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	When we performed our required annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we determined that no impairment existed as the estimated fair value of our reporting units was in excess of their carrying value.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P48_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a non-amortizable intangible asset impairment of $98.1 million in our Global Investment Management segment.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P48_S3	This non-cash write-off was related to a decrease in value of our open-end funds, primarily in Europe.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P48_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded a non-amortizable intangible asset impairment of $19.8 million in our EMEA segment related to the discontinuation of the use of a trade name in the United Kingdom.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P48_S5	See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	Real Estate As of December 31, 2013, the carrying value of our total real estate assets was $127.0 million (1.8% of total assets).
1138118_14_ITEM7_P49_S1	The significant accounting policies and estimates with regard to our real estate assets relate to classification and impairment evaluation, cost capitalization and allocation, disposition of real estate and discontinued operations.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	Classification and Impairment Evaluation With respect to our real estate assets, the Property, Plant and Equipment, Topic of FASB ASC, or Topic 360, establishes criteria to classify an asset as held for sale.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P50_S1	Assets included in real estate held for sale consist of completed assets or land for sale in its present condition that meet all of Topic 360 s held for sale criteria.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	sheet: (i) real estate under development (current), which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of within one year of the balance sheet date; (ii) real estate under development (non-current), which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of more than one year from the balance sheet date; or (iii) real estate held for investment, which consists of land on which development activities have not yet commenced and completed assets or land held for disposition that do not meet the held for sale criteria.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	Real estate held for sale is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less cost to sell.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	If an asset s fair value less cost to sell, based on discounted future cash flows, management estimates or market comparisons, is less than its carrying amount, an allowance is recorded against the asset.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P52_S2	Determining an asset s fair value and the related allowance to record requires us to utilize judgment and estimates.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	Real estate under development and real estate held for investment are carried at cost less depreciation, as applicable.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P53_S1	Buildings and improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, generally up to 39 years.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P53_S2	Tenant improvements included in real estate held for investment are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the terms of the respective leases.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P53_S3	Land improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, up to 15 years.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P53_S4	When indicators of impairment are present, real estate under development and real estate held for investment are evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset are less than the asset s carrying amount.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P53_S5	The amount of the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value, which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, management estimates or market comparisons.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P53_S6	Impairment charges of $26.5 million and $1.7 million were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P53_S7	In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2011, we also recorded a provision for loss on real estate held for sale of $2.6 million.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	We evaluate each of our real estate assets on a quarterly basis in order to determine the classification of each asset in our consolidated balance sheet.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P54_S1	This evaluation requires judgment by us in considering certain criteria that must be evaluated under Topic 360, such as the estimated time to complete assets that are under development and the timeframe in which we expect to sell our real estate assets.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	The classification of real estate assets determines which real estate assets are to be depreciated as well as what method is used to evaluate and measure impairment.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	Cost Capitalization and Allocation When acquiring, developing and constructing real estate assets, we capitalize recoverable costs.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P56_S1	Capitalization begins when we determine that activities related to development have begun and ceases when activities are substantially complete and the asset is available for occupancy, which are timing decisions that require judgment.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P56_S2	Recoverable costs capitalized include pursuit costs, or pre-acquisition/pre-construction costs, taxes and insurance, interest, development and construction costs and costs of incidental operations.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	We do not capitalize any internal costs when acquiring, developing and constructing real estate assets.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P57_S1	We expense transaction costs for acquisitions that qualify as a business in accordance with the Business Combinations Topic of the FASB ASC, or Topic 805.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P57_S2	Pursuit costs capitalized in connection with a potential development project that we have determined based on our judgment not to pursue are written off in the period that such determination is made.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	At times, we purchase bulk land that we intend to sell or develop in phases.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P58_S1	The land basis allocated to each phase is based on the relative estimated fair value of the phases before construction.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P58_S2	We allocate construction costs incurred relating to more than one phase between the various phases; if the costs cannot be specifically attributed to a certain phase or the improvements benefit more than one phase, we allocate the costs between the phases based on their relative estimated sales values, where practicable, or other value methods as appropriate under the circumstances.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P58_S3	Relative allocations of the costs are revised as the sales value estimates are revised.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	When acquiring real estate with existing buildings, we allocate the purchase price between land, land improvements, building and intangibles related to in-place leases, if any, based on their relative fair values.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P59_S1	The fair values of acquired land and buildings are determined based on an estimated discounted future cash flow model with lease-up assumptions as if the building was vacant upon acquisition.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P59_S2	The fair value of in-place leases includes the value of lease intangibles for above or below-market rents and tenant origination costs, determined on a lease by lease basis using assumptions for market rates, absorption periods, lease commissions and tenant improvements.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P59_S3	The capitalized values for both lease intangibles and tenant origination costs are amortized over the term of the underlying leases.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P59_S4	Amortization related to lease intangibles is recorded as either an increase to or a reduction of rental income and amortization for tenant origination costs is recorded to amortization expense.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	Disposition of Real Estate Gains on disposition of real estate are recognized upon sale of the underlying project.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P60_S1	We evaluate each real estate sale transaction to determine if it qualifies for gain recognition under the full accrual method.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P60_S2	This evaluation requires us to make judgments and estimates in assessing whether a sale has been consummated, the adequacy of the buyer s investment, the subordination or collectability of any receivable related to the purchase, and whether we have transferred the usual risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer, with no substantial continuing involvement by us.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P60_S3	If the transaction does not meet the criteria for the full accrual method of profit recognition based on our assessment, we account for the sale based on an appropriate deferral method determined by the nature and extent of the buyer s investment and our continuing involvement.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P60_S4	In some cases, a deferral method could require the real estate asset and its related liabilities to remain on our balance sheet until the sale qualifies for a different deferral method or full accrual profit recognition.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	Discontinued Operations Topic 360 extends the reporting of a discontinued operation to a component of an entity, and further requires that a component be classified as a discontinued operation if the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	As defined in Topic 360, a component of an entity comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the rest of the entity.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P62_S1	Because each of our consolidated real estate assets is generally accounted for in a discrete subsidiary, many constitute a component of an entity under Topic 360, increasing the likelihood that the disposition of assets are required to be recognized and reported as operating profits and losses on discontinued operations in the periods in which they occur.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P62_S2	The evaluation of whether the component s cash flows have been eliminated and the level of our continuing involvement require judgment by us and a different assessment could result in items not being reported as discontinued operations.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with the Accounting for Income Taxes , Topic of the FASB ASC, or Topic 740.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P64_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P64_S2	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	Accounting for tax positions requires judgments, including estimating reserves for potential uncertainties.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P66_S1	We also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	deferred tax assets that we believe will be realized in future periods.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P67_S1	While we believe the resulting tax balances as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with Topic 740, as applicable, the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P67_S2	See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information regarding income taxes.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	Based on $58.0 million repatriated in 2012, and an estimated $133.0 million to be repatriated in 2013 to the United States, a $28.8 million tax benefit was recorded in 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P68_S1	During 2013, we actually repatriated $196.2 million.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P68_S2	Additional tax benefit of $14.5 million was recorded in 2013.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P68_S3	We have not recorded a deferred tax liability for $1.1 billion of remaining undistributed earnings of subsidiaries located outside of the United States.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P68_S4	Although tax liabilities might result from the payment of dividends out of such earnings, or as a result of a sale or liquidation of non-U.S. subsidiaries, these earnings are permanently reinvested outside of the United States and we do not have any plans to repatriate these earnings or to sell or liquidate any of these non-U.S. subsidiaries.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P68_S5	To the extent that we are able to repatriate the unremitted earnings in a tax efficient manner, or in the event of a change in our capital situation or investment strategy in which such funds become needed for funding our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds, net of foreign tax credits.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	The determination of the tax liability upon repatriation is not practicable.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P69_S1	Cash and cash equivalents owned by non-U.S. subsidiaries totaled $325.0 million at December 31, 2013.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	The following table sets forth items derived from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011:
1138118_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	EBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, while amounts shown for EBITDA, as adjusted, remove the impact of certain cash and non-cash charges related to acquisitions and cost containment expenses, as well as certain carried interest incentive compensation expense.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P71_S1	Our management believes that both of these measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculations of EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, generally eliminate the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	As a result, our management uses these measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes, including as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive programs.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P72_S1	Additionally, we believe EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, are useful to investors to assist them in getting a more complete picture of our results from operations.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P72_S2	However, EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, are not recognized measurements under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and when analyzing our operating performance, readers should use EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P72_S3	Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P72_S4	Furthermore, EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for our management s discretionary use, as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P72_S5	The amounts shown for EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P72_S6	EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted for selected charges are calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2012 We reported consolidated net income of $316.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 on revenue of $7.2 billion as compared to consolidated net income of $315.6 million on revenue of $6.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P73_S1	Our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by $670.7 million, or 10.3%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P73_S2	This increase was primarily driven by higher worldwide sales (up 23.9%), property, facilities and project management (up 11.3%) and leasing (up 8.6%) activity.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P73_S3	Carried interest revenue earned in our Global Investment Management segment also contributed to the positive variance.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P73_S4	These items were partially offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $73.4 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P73_S5	Our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by $446.9 million, or 11.9%, during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P73_S6	Our sales professionals generally are paid on a commission basis, which substantially correlates with our transaction revenue performance.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P73_S7	Accordingly, the increase in sales and lease transaction revenue led to a corresponding increase in commission accruals.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P73_S8	The increase in cost of services was also due to higher salaries and related costs associated with our global property, facilities and project management contracts as well as higher bonuses in the United States and the United Kingdom due to increased headcount and improved operating performance.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P73_S9	Foreign currency translation had a $41.9 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P73_S10	Cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased to 58.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013 from 57.5% for the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily attributable to a concentration of commissions among higher producing professionals in the United States and Asia Pacific.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P73_S11	In addition, higher producer recruitment costs in the current year increased this ratio.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P73_S12	Our operating, administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis increased by $101.4 million, or 5.1%, during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P73_S13	The increase was primarily driven by strategic investments made in the current year, including increased headcount, as well as higher insurance, legal, consulting, marketing and travel costs.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P73_S14	These increases were partially offset by $32.3 million of impairment charges incurred in the prior year that did not recur in the current year and $25.1 million of lower transaction and integration costs attributable to acquisitions.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P73_S15	Foreign currency translation had an $18.4 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P73_S16	Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 30.7% for the year ended December 31, 2012 to 29.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013, partially driven by the aforementioned lower costs associated with impairments and acquisitions in the current year.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P73_S17	Excluding such costs, operating expenses were 29.1% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013 versus 29.6% for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P73_S18	The current year decrease was achieved despite incremental investments in our operating platform and outside insurance costs, reflecting the operating leverage inherent in our business and proactive cost savings initiatives.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P73_S19	Our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by $20.7 million, or 12.2%, during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P73_S20	An increase in depreciation expense in the current year driven by technology-related capital expenditures and an increase in amortization expense related to mortgage servicing rights in the current year, were partially mitigated by $9.6 million of intangible amortization expense related to ING REIM incentive fees in the year ended December 31, 2012, which did not recur in the current year.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P73_S21	Our non-amortizable intangible asset impairment on a consolidated basis was $98.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to $19.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P73_S22	This activity represented non-cash write-offs related to a decrease in value of our open-end funds in our Global Investment Management segment, primarily in Europe, in the current year and the discontinuation of the use of a trade name in the United Kingdom in our EMEA segment in the prior year.

1138118_14_ITEM7_P75_S24	This decrease was primarily driven by higher equity earnings associated with gains on property sales within our Development Services segment in 2011, which did not occur to the same extent in 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P75_S25	Our other income on a consolidated basis was $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.

1138118_14_ITEM7_P77_S3	The increase was primarily due to higher interest expense attributable to additional borrowings made to finance the REIM Acquisitions in the second and third quarters of 2011 and the British pound sterling A-1 term loan facility entered into in the fourth quarter of 2011.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P77_S4	Our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was $185.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to $189.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.

1138118_14_ITEM7_P77_S6	The decreases in our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate were primarily the result of non-deductible acquisition costs incurred in 2011 that did not recur in 2012 and the 2012 benefit from previously unavailable foreign income tax credits that can be utilized to offset U.S. federal income taxes on foreign-sourced earnings, partially offset by an increase in valuation allowance, tax expense on dividends and unremitted earnings and an increase in our mix of domestic to foreign earnings.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P77_S7	Our consolidated income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, was $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $49.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.

1138118_14_ITEM7_P91_S3	Foreign currency translation had an $11.0 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P91_S4	Cost of services as a percentage of revenue were relatively consistent at 63.5% for the year ended December 31, 2012 versus 63.3% for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P91_S5	Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $31.3 million, or 3.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P91_S6	The increase was primarily driven by higher payroll-related costs, including bonuses, which resulted from increased headcount and improved operating performance.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P91_S7	Foreign currency translation had a $7.9 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P91_S8	EMEA Revenue decreased by $44.8 million, or 4.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P91_S9	Foreign currency translation had a $51.4 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P92_S0	increased $6.6 million driven by higher outsourcing and sales revenue, partially offset by lower leasing activity market-wide.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P92_S1	Revenue grew modestly in the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, but this was offset by reduced revenue in other countries in the region, most notably in France, which had a particularly strong year in 2011.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P92_S2	Cost of services decreased by $13.9 million, or 2.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P92_S3	Foreign currency translation had a $32.8 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P92_S4	This was partially offset by higher costs primarily associated with increased headcount attributable to in-fill acquisitions completed in mid to late 2011.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P92_S5	Cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased to 60.5% for the year ended December 31, 2012 from 59.3% for the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily driven by our mix of revenue, with outsourcing revenue comprising a greater portion of the total than in 2011, as well as a decline in transaction revenue in certain countries that have a significant fixed cost compensation structure.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P92_S6	Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $7.4 million, or 2.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to higher cost containment expenses incurred in 2012 and increased costs, including payroll-related and occupancy costs, partly stemming from in-fill acquisitions made in mid to late 2011.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P92_S7	These costs were largely offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $17.0 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P93_S0	Asia Pacific Revenue increased by $28.5 million, or 3.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, reflecting improved overall performance in several countries, particularly Australia, India and Singapore.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P93_S1	Investment sales in the region saw less activity than in 2011.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P93_S2	However, this was more than offset by growth in outsourcing, appraisal and lease revenue.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P93_S3	Foreign currency translation had an $18.7 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P93_S4	Cost of services increased by $18.2 million, or 3.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, driven by higher salaries and related costs associated with our property and facilities management contracts throughout the region and increases in headcount, particularly in Australia (partially due to an in-fill acquisition completed in May 2011) as well as investments in China.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P93_S5	These increases were partially offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $14.4 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended December 31, 2012 as well as lower commission expense attributable to the decrease in sales transaction revenue.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P93_S6	Cost of services as a percentage of revenue was flat at 62.5% for both the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P93_S7	Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $12.0 million, or 5.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P93_S8	The increase was partially due to higher legal fees incurred in 2012, increased costs stemming from an in-fill acquisition completed in Australia as well as investments in China.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P93_S9	Foreign currency translation had a $1.3 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P93_S10	Global Investment Management Revenue increased by $192.5 million, or 66.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, driven by contributions from the REIM Acquisitions acquired in the second half of 2011.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P93_S11	Foreign currency translation had a $14.3 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P93_S12	Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $74.5 million, or 23.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P94_S0	increase in costs attributable to the REIM Acquisition and a $9.3 million impairment charge on a real estate asset incurred in 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P94_S1	Foreign currency translation had a $13.5 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P94_S2	Total AUM as of December 31, 2012 amounted to $92.0 billion, down 2.2% from year-end 2011.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P94_S3	Development Services Revenue increased by $2.5 million, or 3.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, attributable to an increase in incentive fees, largely offset by lower rental revenue as a result of property dispositions in the later quarters of 2011.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P94_S4	Operating, administrative and other expenses decreased by $4.9 million, or 4.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P94_S5	This decrease was primarily driven by lower bonus expense partially due to higher gains on property sales in 2011 as well as lower property operating expenses as a result of the property dispositions noted above in this segment s revenue discussion.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P94_S6	These decreases were mostly offset by higher impairment charges related to real estate assets incurred in 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P95_S0	As of December 31, 2012, development projects in process totaled $4.2 billion, down $0.7 billion from year-end 2011.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P95_S1	The inventory of pipeline deals totaled $2.1 billion, up $0.9 billion from year-end 2011.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P96_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that we can satisfy our working capital requirements and funding of investments with internally generated cash flow and, as necessary, borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P96_S1	Our expected capital requirements for 2014 include up to approximately $185 million of anticipated net capital expenditures.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P96_S2	As of December 31, 2013, we had committed to fund $25.0 million of additional capital to unconsolidated subsidiaries within our Development Services business, which may be called at any time.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P96_S3	Additionally, as of December 31, 2013, we had aggregate commitments of $9.4 million to fund future co-investments in our Global Investment Management business, $8.1 million of which is expected to be funded in 2014.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P96_S4	In recent years, the global credit markets have remained tight, which could affect both the availability and cost of our funding sources in the future.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P96_S5	In 2013, we fortified our real estate outsourcing platform in Europe with the acquisition of London-based Norland for approximately $475 million, which was financed with cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P96_S6	During 2011, we required substantial amounts of debt financing to fund the REIM Acquisitions.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P96_S7	The acquisitions included substantially all of the ING REIM operations in Europe and Asia, as well as substantially all of CRES, its U.S.-based global real estate listed securities business, as well as certain CRES co-investments from ING and additional interests in other funds managed by ING REIM Europe and ING REIM Asia.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P96_S8	On July 1, 2011, we acquired CRES for $332.8 million and CRES co-investments from ING for an aggregate amount of $58.6 million, using borrowings from our term loan facility under our credit agreement to finance these transactions.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P96_S9	On October 3, 2011, we acquired ING REIM s operations in Asia for $45.3 million and three ING REIM Asia co-investments from ING for an aggregate amount of $13.9 million, using borrowings from our term loan facility under our credit agreement to finance these transactions.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P96_S10	On October 31, 2011, we completed the ING REIM Europe portion of the REIM Acquisitions, acquiring ING REIM s operations in Europe for $441.5 million and one co-investment from ING for $7.4 million, using borrowings from our term loan facility under our credit agreement, cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to finance these transactions.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P96_S11	During the year ended December 31, 2012, we also funded nine additional co-investments for an aggregate amount of $34.5 million related to ING REIM Europe.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P96_S12	We also conducted three debt offerings in recent years.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P97_S0	Absent extraordinary transactions such as these and the equity offerings we completed during the unprecedented global capital markets disruption in 2008 and 2009 as well as the debt offerings we completed in 2009, 2010 and March 2013, we historically have not sought external sources of financing and have relied on our internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital, capital expenditure and investment requirements.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P97_S1	In the absence of such extraordinary events, we anticipate that our cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future, but at a minimum for the next 12 months.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P98_S0	From time to time, we may again seek to take advantage of market opportunities to refinance existing debt securities with new debt securities at lower interest rates, with longer maturities or at better terms.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P99_S0	As evidenced above, from time to time we consider potential strategic acquisitions.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P99_S1	We believe that any future significant acquisitions that we may make could require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P99_S2	In the past, we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that we believed to be reasonable.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P99_S3	However, it is possible that we may not be able to find acquisition financing on favorable terms, or at all, in the future if we decide to make any further material acquisitions.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P100_S0	Our long-term liquidity needs, other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases, generally are comprised of three elements.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P101_S0	The first is the repayment of the outstanding and anticipated principal amounts of our long-term indebtedness.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P101_S1	We are unable to project with certainty whether our long-term cash flow from operations will be sufficient to repay our long-term debt when it comes due.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P101_S2	If our cash flow is insufficient, then we expect that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P101_S3	We cannot make any assurances that such refinancing or amendments would be available on attractive terms, if at all.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P102_S0	The second long-term liquidity need is the repayment of obligations under our pension plans in the United Kingdom.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P102_S1	Our subsidiaries based in the United Kingdom maintain two contributory defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in the plans.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P102_S2	With respect to these plans, our historical policy has been to contribute annually, an amount to fund pension cost as actuarially determined and as required by applicable laws and regulations.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P102_S3	Our contributions to these plans are invested and, if these investments do not perform in the future as well as we expect, we will be required to provide additional funding to cover any shortfall.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P102_S4	During 2007, we reached agreements with the active members of these plans to freeze future pension plan benefits.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P102_S5	In return, the active members became eligible to enroll in the CBRE Group Personal Pension plan, a defined contribution plan in the United Kingdom.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P102_S6	The underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans included in pension liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report was $68.0 million and $63.5 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P102_S7	We expect to contribute a total of $6.2 million to fund our pension plans for the year ending December 31, 2014.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P103_S0	The third long-term liquidity need is the payment of obligations related to acquisitions.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P103_S1	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had $86.9 million and $14.7 million, respectively, of deferred purchase consideration outstanding included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P103_S2	Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $745.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $454.0 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P103_S3	This variance was primarily due to a decrease in real estate held for sale and under development and higher bonus accruals in the current year.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P103_S4	In addition, improved operating performance and greater collections on receivables in the current year contributed to the variance.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P103_S5	These items were partially offset by higher bonus payments made in the current year.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P104_S0	Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $291.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $70.1 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P104_S1	The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2012 was primarily due to higher bonuses, commissions and income taxes paid and activities associated with securities acquired in our acquisition of CRES.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P104_S2	In addition, increases in receivables and real estate held for sale and under development in 2012 as well as higher tenant concessions received in 2011 also contributed to the variance.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P104_S3	These items were partially offset by improved operating performance and an increase in accounts payable in 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P105_S0	Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $465.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $267.3 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P105_S1	This variance was primarily driven by greater amounts paid for acquisitions in the current year.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P105_S2	This was partially offset by higher proceeds received from the sale of real estate held for investment in the current year and a decrease in cash in the prior year as a result of the deconsolidation of CBRE Clarion U.S., L.P. in 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P105_S3	Higher contributions to unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2012, greater distributions from unconsolidated subsidiaries in the current year and a decrease in restricted cash in the current year versus an increase in restricted cash in the prior year also mitigated the increase in cash used in investing activities.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P105_S4	Net cash used in investing activities totaled $197.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $282.6 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P105_S5	The decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2012 was primarily driven by a greater amount of cash paid for the REIM Acquisitions in 2011.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P105_S6	This was partially offset by higher net proceeds received from the disposition of real estate held for investment in 2011, a decrease in cash as a result of the deconsolidation of CBRE Clarion U.S., L.P. in 2012 and higher distributions from investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2011.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P105_S7	Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $866.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $765.6 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P105_S8	The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to our refinancing efforts during the year ended December 31, 2013, including the net repayment of $924.0 million of senior secured term loans and the redemption of $450.0 million of 11.625% senior subordinated notes, partially offset by the issuance of $800.0 million of 5.00% senior notes.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P105_S9	In addition, higher net repayments of notes payable on real estate within our Development Services segment in the current year and higher distributions to non-controlling interests in the current year also contributed to the increase.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P105_S10	Net cash used in financing activities totaled $100.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 versus net cash provided by financing activities of $711.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P105_S11	The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to $800.0 million of tranche C and D term loan facilities drawn in 2011 to finance the REIM Acquisitions and proceeds from the British pound sterling A-1 term loan facility received in 2011.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P105_S12	This was partially offset by higher net repayments of notes payable on real estate in 2011, greater distributions to non-controlling interests in 2011 as well as more financing costs paid in 2011.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P106_S0	The following is a summary of our various contractual obligations and other commitments as of December 31, 2013:
1138118_14_ITEM7_P107_S0	(1) See Note 13 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P107_S1	Figures do not include scheduled interest payments.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P107_S2	Assuming each debt obligation is held until maturity, we estimate that we will make the following interest payments (dollars in thousands): 2014 $81,824; 2015 to 2016 $154,694; 2017 to 2018 $146,221 and thereafter $227,017.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P107_S3	The interest payments on the variable rate debt have been calculated at the interest rate in effect at December 31, 2013.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P108_S0	(2) See Note 14 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P109_S0	(3) See Note 15 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P110_S0	(4) Because these obligations are related, either wholly or partially, to the future retirement of our employees and such retirement dates are not predictable, an undeterminable portion of this amount will be paid in years one through five.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P111_S0	(5) See Note 12 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P111_S1	Figures do not include scheduled interest payments.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P111_S2	The notes (primarily construction loans) have either fixed or variable interest rates, ranging from 2.42% to 6.04% at December 31, 2013.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P111_S3	In general, interest is drawn on the underlying loan and subsequently paid with proceeds received upon the sale of the real estate project.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P112_S0	(6) Represents deferred obligations related to previous acquisitions, which are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2013 set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P113_S0	(7) Due to the nature of guarantees, payments could be due at any time upon the occurrence of certain triggering events including default.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P113_S1	Accordingly, all guarantees are reflected as expiring in less than one year.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P114_S0	(8) Includes $9.4 million related to our Global Investment Management segment, $8.1 million of which is expected to be funded in 2014 and $25.0 million related to our Development Services segment (callable at any time).
1138118_14_ITEM7_P115_S0	(9) As of December 31, 2013, our current and non-current tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, totaled $97.9 million.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P115_S1	Of this amount, we can reasonably estimate that $32.4 million will require cash settlement in less than one year and $14.8 million will require cash settlement in one to three years.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P115_S2	We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions for the remaining $50.7 million.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P116_S0	(10) Represents outstanding reserves for claims under certain insurance programs, which are included in other current and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2013 set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P116_S1	Due to the nature of this item, payments could be due at any time upon the occurrence of certain events.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P116_S2	Accordingly, the entire balance has been reflected as expiring in less than one year.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P117_S0	Our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to pay the principal amount of our indebtedness and other obligations when due.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P117_S1	In addition, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or for other purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P117_S2	If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our debt, would increase.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P118_S0	Since 2001, we have maintained credit facilities with Credit Suisse Group AG, or CS, and other lenders to fund strategic acquisitions and to provide for our working capital needs.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P118_S1	On November 10, 2010, we entered into a credit agreement (as amended, the 2010 Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks led by CS, as administrative and collateral agent, to completely refinance our previous credit facilities.

1138118_14_ITEM7_P143_S0	In January 2008, CBRE Multifamily Capital, Inc., or CBRE MCI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBRE Capital Markets, Inc., entered into an agreement with Fannie Mae, under Fannie Mae s Delegated Underwriting and Servicing Lender Program, or DUS Program, to provide financing for multifamily housing with five or more units.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P143_S1	Under the DUS Program, CBRE MCI originates, underwrites, closes and services loans without prior approval by Fannie Mae, and in selected cases, is subject to sharing up to one-third of any losses on loans originated under the DUS Program.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P143_S2	CBRE MCI has funded loans subject to such loss sharing arrangements with unpaid principal balances of $7.8 billion at December 31, 2013.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P143_S3	Additionally, CBRE MCI has funded loans under the DUS Program that are not subject to loss sharing arrangements with unpaid principal balances of approximately $369.0 million at December 31, 2013.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P144_S0	CBRE MCI, under its agreement with Fannie Mae, must post cash reserves under formulas established by Fannie Mae to provide for sufficient capital in the event losses occur.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P144_S1	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, CBRE MCI had $16.6 million and $9.1 million, respectively, of cash deposited under this reserve arrangement, and had provided approximately $13.8 million and $10.6 million, respectively, of loan loss accruals.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P144_S2	Fannie Mae s recourse under the DUS Program is limited to the assets of CBRE MCI, which totaled approximately $367.4 million (including $226.4 million of warehouse receivables, a substantial majority of which are pledged against warehouse lines of credit and are therefore not available to Fannie Mae) at December 31, 2013.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P145_S0	An important part of the strategy for our Global Investment Management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P145_S1	These co-investments typically range from 2.0% to 5.0% of the equity in a particular fund.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P145_S2	As of December 31, 2013, we had aggregate commitments of $9.4 million to fund future co-investments, $8.1 million of which is expected to be funded in 2014.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P145_S3	In addition to required future capital contributions, some of the co-investment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets and the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P145_S4	Additionally, an important part of our Development Services business strategy is to invest in unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries as a principal (in most cases co-investing with our clients).
1138118_14_ITEM7_P145_S5	As of December 31, 2013, we had committed to fund $25.0 million of additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries, which may be called at any time.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P146_S0	Seasonality A significant portion of our revenue is seasonal, which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P147_S0	Historically, our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flow from operating activities tends to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P148_S0	fourth quarter due to the focus on completing sales, financing and leasing transactions prior to calendar year-end.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P148_S1	This has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first quarter, with revenue and profitability improving in each subsequent quarter.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P149_S0	Inflation Our commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by real estate market supply and demand, which may be affected by general economic conditions including inflation.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P149_S1	However, to date, we do not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon our operations.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P150_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements In March 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2013-05, Foreign Currency Matters (Topic 830): Parent s Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P150_S1	This ASU states that when a reporting entity (parent) ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business (other than a sale of in substance real estate or conveyance of oil and gas mineral rights) within a foreign entity, the parent is required to apply the guidance in Subtopic 830-30 to release any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P150_S2	Accordingly, the cumulative translation adjustment should be released into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P151_S0	ASU 2013-05 is effective prospectively for fiscal years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2013, with early adoption permitted.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P151_S1	We do not believe the adoption of this update will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P152_S0	In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P152_S1	This ASU states that an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward, except as follows: To the extent a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position or the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require the entity to use, and the entity does not intend to use, the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P152_S2	This ASU applies to all entities that have unrecognized tax benefits when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists at the reporting date.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P152_S3	This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013, with early adoption permitted.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P152_S4	This ASU should be applied prospectively to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist at the effective date, with retrospective application permitted.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P152_S5	We do not believe the adoption of this update will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P153_S0	Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our exposure to market risk consists of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations and changes in interest rates on debt obligations.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P153_S1	We manage such risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of our debt funding and by using derivative financial instruments.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P154_S0	We apply the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) (Topic 815) when accounting for derivative financial instruments.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P154_S1	In all cases, we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and, accordingly, do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P155_S0	Exchange Rates During the year ended December 31, 2013, approximately 39% of our business was transacted in local currencies of foreign countries, the majority of which includes the Euro, the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar, the Chinese yuan, the Hong Kong dollar, the Japanese yen, the Singapore dollar, the Australian dollar and the Indian rupee.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P155_S1	We attempt to manage our exposure primarily by balancing assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions in foreign currencies only at levels necessary for operating purposes.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P155_S2	Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported amounts of our total assets and liabilities, which are reflected in our financial statements as translated into U.S. dollars for each financial reporting period at the exchange rate in effect on the respective balance sheet dates, and our total revenue and expenses, which are reflected in our financial statements as translated into U.S. dollars for each financial reporting period at the monthly average exchange rate.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P155_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2013, foreign currency translation had a $73.4 million negative impact on our total revenue and a $60.3 million positive impact on our total costs of services and operating, administrative and other expenses.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P156_S0	We routinely monitor our exposure to currency exchange rate changes in connection with transactions and sometimes enter into foreign currency exchange option and forward contracts to limit our exposure to such transactions, as appropriate.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P156_S1	In the normal course of business, we also sometimes utilize derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange exposure resulting from intercompany loans, expected cash flow and earnings.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P156_S2	On March 22, 2013, we entered into three option agreements, including one to sell a notional amount of 9.5 million Euros, which expired on June 26, 2013, one to sell a notional amount of 4.5 million Euros, which expired on September 26, 2013 and one to sell a notional amount of 21.0 million Euros, which expired on December 27, 2013.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P156_S3	On September 4, 2013, we entered into two option agreements, including one to sell a notional amount of 6.1 million British pounds sterling, which expired on September 26, 2013 and one to sell a notional amount of 13.7 million British pounds sterling, which expired on December 27, 2013.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P156_S4	Included in the consolidated statement of operations set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report were losses of $1.8 million and $4.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, resulting from net losses on foreign currency exchange option agreements.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P156_S5	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we did not have any foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P157_S0	Interest Rates We manage our interest expense by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P157_S1	Excluding notes payable on real estate, our fixed and variable rate long-term debt at December 31, 2013 consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_14_ITEM7_P158_S0	(1) Consists of amounts due under our senior secured term loan facilities.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P159_S0	We utilize sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect of our variable rate debt.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P159_S1	If interest rates were to increase by 10.0% on our outstanding variable rate debt, excluding notes payable on real estate, at December 31, 2013, the net impact of the additional interest cost would be a decrease of $2.5 million on pre-tax income and a decrease of $2.5 million on cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P159_S2	The estimated fair value of our senior secured term loans was approximately $687.6 million at December 31, 2013.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P159_S3	Based on dealers quotes, the estimated fair values of our 5.00% senior notes and 6.625% senior notes were $769.4 million and $372.8 million, respectively, at December 31, 2013.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P160_S0	In March 2011, we entered into five interest rate swap agreements, all with effective dates in October 2011, and immediately designated them as cash flow hedges in accordance with Topic 815.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P160_S1	The purpose of these interest rate swap agreements is to hedge potential changes to our cash flows due to the variable interest nature of our senior secured term loan facilities.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P160_S2	The total notional amount of these interest rate swap agreements is $400.0 million, with $200.0 million expiring in October 2017 and $200.0 million expiring in September 2019.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P161_S0	There was no significant hedge ineffectiveness for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P161_S1	As of December 31, 2013, the fair values of these interest rate swap agreements were reflected as a $29.0 million liability and were included in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P161_S2	We also have $130.5 million of notes payable on real estate as of December 31, 2013.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P161_S3	These notes have interest rates ranging from 2.42% to 6.04% with maturity dates extending through 2023.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P161_S4	Interest costs relating to notes payable on real estate include both interest that is expensed and interest that is capitalized as part of the cost of real estate.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P161_S5	If interest rates were to increase by 10.0%, our total estimated interest cost related to notes payable would increase by approximately $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P162_S0	From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap and cap agreements in order to limit our interest expense related to our notes payable on real estate.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P162_S1	If any of these agreements are not designated as effective hedges, then they are marked to market each period with the change in fair value recognized in current period earnings.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P163_S0	The net impact on our earnings resulting from gains and/or losses on interest rate swap and cap agreements associated with notes payable on real estate has not been significant.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P164_S0	We also enter into loan commitments that relate to the origination or acquisition of commercial mortgage loans that will be held for resale.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P164_S1	FASB ASC Topic 815 requires that these commitments be recorded at their fair values as derivatives.
1138118_14_ITEM7_P164_S2	The net impact on our financial position and earnings resulting from these derivatives contracts has not been significant.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES All other schedules are omitted because they are either not applicable, not required or the information required is included in the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes thereto.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P1_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders CBRE Group, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CBRE Group, Inc. (the Company) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2013.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P1_S1	In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the related financial statement schedules.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P1_S2	We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1138118_14_ITEM8_P1_S3	The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting .
1138118_14_ITEM8_P1_S4	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P1_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1138118_14_ITEM8_P1_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P1_S7	Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P1_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P1_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P1_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P2_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P2_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P2_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P2_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P3_S0	CBRE Group, Inc. acquired London-based Norland Managed Services Ltd during 2013 ( Acquired Business ) as defined in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of CBRE Group, Inc s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, the Acquired Business s internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets of $680.2 million included in the consolidated financial statements of CBRE Group, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P3_S1	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of CBRE Group, Inc. also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the Acquired Business.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P4_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of CBRE Group, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P4_S1	Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P5_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P6_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.

1138118_14_ITEM8_P9_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P10_S0	Nature of Operations CBRE Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (which may be referred to in these financial statements as the company , we , us and our ), was incorporated on February 20, 2001.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P10_S1	We are the world s largest commercial real estate services and investment firm, based on 2013 revenue, with leading full-service operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P10_S2	We offer a full range of services to occupiers, owners, lenders and investors in office, retail, industrial, multifamily and other types of commercial real estate.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P10_S3	As of December 31, 2013, excluding independent affiliates, we operated in approximately 350 offices worldwide, with approximately 44,000 employees providing commercial real estate services under the CBRE brand name, investment management services under the CBRE Global Investors brand name and development services under the Trammell Crow brand name.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P10_S4	Our business is focused on several competencies, including commercial property and corporate facilities management, tenant/occupier and property/agency leasing, property sales, real estate investment management, valuation, commercial mortgage origination and servicing, capital markets (structured finance and debt) solutions, development services and proprietary research.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P10_S5	We generate revenue from management fees on a contractual and per-project basis, and from commissions on transactions.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P10_S6	Our contractual, fee-for-services businesses, which generally involve facilities management, property management, mortgage loan servicing and investment management, represented approximately 41% of our 2013 revenue.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P11_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majority-owned subsidiaries, as well as variable interest entities (VIEs) in which we are the primary beneficiary and other subsidiaries of which we have control.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P11_S1	The equity attributable to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries is shown separately in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P11_S2	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P12_S0	Variable Interest Entities As required by the Consolidations Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) (Topic 810), we consolidate all VIEs in which we are the entity s primary beneficiary.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P12_S1	A reporting entity is determined to be the primary beneficiary if it holds a controlling financial interest in the VIE.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P12_S2	(2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from such entity that could potentially be significant to such entity.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P12_S3	The entity which satisfies these criteria is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P13_S0	We determine if an entity is a VIE based on several factors, including whether the entity s total equity investment at risk upon inception is sufficient to finance the entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P13_S1	We make judgments regarding the sufficiency of the equity at risk based first on a qualitative analysis, then a quantitative analysis, if necessary.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P14_S0	We analyze any investments in VIEs to determine if we are the primary beneficiary.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P14_S1	We consider a variety of factors in identifying the entity that holds the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance including, but not limited to, the ability to direct financing, leasing, construction and other operating decisions and activities.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P14_S2	In addition, we consider the rights of other investors to participate in those decisions, to replace the manager and to sell or liquidate the entity.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P15_S0	We also have several co-investments in real estate investment funds which qualify for a deferral of the qualitative approach for analyzing potential VIEs.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P15_S1	We continue to analyze these investments under the former quantitative method incorporating various estimates, including estimated future cash flows, asset hold periods and discount rates, as well as estimates of the probabilities of various scenarios occurring.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P16_S0	If the entity is a VIE, we then determine whether we consolidate the entity as the primary beneficiary.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P16_S1	This determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary includes any impact of an upside economic interest in the form of a promote that we may have.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P17_S0	A promote is an interest built into the distribution structure of the entity based on the entity s achievement of certain return hurdles.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P18_S0	We consolidate any VIE of which we are the primary beneficiary (see Note 4) and disclose significant VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary, if any, as well as disclose our maximum exposure to loss related to VIEs that are not consolidated.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P18_S1	We determine whether an entity is a VIE and, if so, whether it should be consolidated by utilizing judgments and estimates that are inherently subjective.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P18_S2	If an entity is not a VIE, our determination of the appropriate accounting method with respect to our investments in limited partnerships, limited liability companies and other subsidiaries is based on voting control.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P18_S3	For our general partner interests, we are presumed to control (and therefore consolidate) the entity, unless the other limited partners have substantive rights that overcome this presumption of control.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P18_S4	These substantive rights allow the limited partners to remove the general partner with or without cause or to participate in significant decisions made in the ordinary course of the entity s business.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P18_S5	We account for our non-controlling general partner investments in these entities under the equity method.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P18_S6	This treatment also applies to our managing member interests in limited liability companies.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P18_S7	Our determination of the appropriate accounting method for all other investments in subsidiaries is based on the amount of influence we have (including our ownership interest) in the underlying entity.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P18_S8	Those other investments where we have the ability to exercise significant influence (but not control) over operating and financial policies of such subsidiaries (including certain subsidiaries where we have less than 20% ownership) are accounted for using the equity method.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P18_S9	We eliminate transactions with such equity method subsidiaries to the extent of our ownership in such subsidiaries.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P18_S10	Accordingly, our share of the earnings or losses of these equity method subsidiaries is included in consolidated net income.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P18_S11	All of our remaining investments are carried at cost.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P19_S0	Under either the equity or cost method, impairment losses are recognized upon evidence of other-than-temporary losses of value.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P20_S0	When testing for impairment on investments that are not actively traded on a public market, we generally use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our investments and/or look to comparable activities in the marketplace.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P20_S1	Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow approach.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P20_S2	These assumptions include net asset values, internal rates of return, discount and capitalization rates, interest rates and financing terms, rental rates, timing of leasing activity, estimates of lease terms and related concessions, etc.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P20_S3	When determining if impairment is other-than-temporary, we also look to the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been less than cost as well as the financial condition and near-term prospects of each investment.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P21_S0	Estimates, Risks and Uncertainties Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.), which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P22_S0	Such estimates include the value of goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets, accounts receivable, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, retirement and other post-employment benefits, among others.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P22_S1	These estimates and assumptions are based on management s best judgment, and are evaluated on an ongoing basis and adjusted, as needed, using historical experience and other factors, including consideration of the macroeconomic environment.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P22_S2	The after-effects of the recent global financial crisis, including highly volatile credit, equity and foreign currency markets and a slow and uneven global economic recovery, have increased the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P22_S3	As future events and their effects cannot be forecast with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P22_S4	Changes in those estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P23_S0	The fair value of our goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets is impacted by economic and capital market conditions as well as our stock price.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P23_S1	Property sales and leasing activity is affected by economic and employment growth, capital markets liquidity, credit availability and pricing, business and investor confidence, and inflation levels.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P23_S2	Adverse trends involving any or all of these factors could reduce transaction-based revenue as well as property values and sales and leasing volume.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P23_S3	Such adverse economic conditions could cause declines in the estimated future discounted cash flows expected for our reporting units.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P23_S4	A major or sustained decline in our future cash flows and/or the current economic conditions could result in impairment charges.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P24_S0	The recoverability of our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries has been impacted by the global financial crisis.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P24_S1	This was initially evident in sharply reduced property sales activity and decreasing property values throughout 2009.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P24_S2	As liquidity subsequently improved, transaction activity has revived, to varying degrees and at a different pace in various regions around the world, over the past four years from the low levels of 2008 and 2009, but has remained well below the volume experienced in 2006 and 2007.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P24_S3	Property values also have rebounded, but price appreciation has been most significant in top-tier assets and in the largest, most liquid markets.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P25_S0	The assumptions utilized in our recoverability analysis reflect our belief that a gradual recovery will continue, but that a return to capital markets turmoil and negative economic growth could result in impairment charges.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P26_S0	The recoverability of the carrying value of our investments in real estate is impacted by general conditions in the U.S. economy and commercial real estate market.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P26_S1	Market fundamentals in the primary property types that we develop or own weakened significantly in late 2008 and throughout 2009.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P26_S2	Market conditions have improved, to varying degrees and at a different pace in various regions globally, over the past four years.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P26_S3	Property sales have increased steadily as investor confidence and liquidity returned to the commercial real estate market.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P26_S4	However, if conditions in the broader economy, capital markets, local, regional or global commercial real estate markets decline sharply once again, we may be required to record impairment charges.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P27_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents generally consist of cash and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of less than three months.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P27_S1	Included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 is cash and cash equivalents of $32.4 million and $94.6 million, respectively, from consolidated funds and other entities, which is not available for general corporate use.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P27_S2	We also manage certain cash and cash equivalents as an agent for our investment and property and facilities management clients.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P27_S3	These amounts are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets (see Note 19).
1138118_14_ITEM8_P28_S0	Restricted Cash Included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 is restricted cash of $61.2 million and $73.7 million, respectively.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P28_S1	The balances primarily include restricted cash set aside to cover funding obligations as required by contracts executed by us in the normal course of business.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P29_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist principally of trade receivables and interest-bearing investments.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P29_S1	Users of real estate services account for a substantial portion of trade receivables and collateral is generally not required.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P29_S2	The risk associated with this concentration is limited due to the large number of users and their geographic dispersion.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P30_S0	We place substantially all of our interest-bearing investments with major financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P31_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P31_S1	Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment is computed primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging up to 15 years.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P32_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the term of their associated leases, excluding options to renew, since such leases generally do not carry prohibitive penalties for non-renewal.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P33_S0	We capitalize expenditures that materially increase the life of our assets and expense the costs of maintenance and repairs.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P33_S1	We review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P33_S2	If this review indicates that such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment is recognized in the period the changes occur and represents the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P34_S0	Certain costs related to the development or purchase of internal-use software are capitalized.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P34_S1	Internal computer software costs that are incurred in the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P34_S2	Direct consulting costs as well as payroll and related costs, which are incurred during the development stage of a project are generally capitalized and amortized over a three-year period (except for enterprise software development platforms, which range from five to ten years) when placed into production.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P35_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting, which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P35_S1	The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P35_S2	The majority of our goodwill balance has resulted from our acquisition of CBRE Services, Inc. (CBRE) in 2001 (the 2001 Acquisition), our acquisition of Insignia Financial Group, Inc. (Insignia) in 2003 (the Insignia Acquisition), our acquisition of the Trammell Crow Company in 2006 (the Trammell Crow Company Acquisition), our acquisition of substantially all of the ING Group N.V. (ING) Real Estate Investment Management (REIM) operations in Europe and Asia, as well as substantially all of Clarion Real Estate Securities (CRES) in 2011 (collectively referred to as the REIM Acquisitions) and our acquisition of Norland Managed Services Ltd (Norland) in 2013.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P35_S3	Other intangible assets that have indefinite estimated useful lives and are not being amortized include certain management contracts identified in the REIM Acquisitions, a trademark, which was separately identified as a result of the 2001 Acquisition, as well as a trade name separately identified as a result of the REIM Acquisitions.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P35_S4	The remaining other intangible assets primarily include customer relationships, loan servicing rights and management contracts, which are all being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging up to 20 years.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P35_S5	We are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P36_S0	The goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step process.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P37_S0	The first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P37_S1	We use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P38_S0	required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P38_S1	These assumptions include revenue growth rates, profit margin percentages, discount rates, etc.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P39_S0	If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered to not be impaired.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P39_S1	If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P40_S0	The second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P40_S1	The implied fair value of goodwill is determined similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination, by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one, over the estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P40_S2	Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business s fair value and the relative size of our goodwill, if different assumptions and estimates were used, it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P41_S0	Deferred Financing Costs Costs incurred in connection with financing activities are generally deferred and amortized over the terms of the related debt agreements ranging up to ten years.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P41_S1	Amortization of these costs is charged to interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P41_S2	Total deferred financing costs, net of accumulated amortization, included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were $42.3 million and $42.2 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P41_S3	During 2013, we completed a series of financing transactions, including the amendment and restatement of our credit agreement, the issuance of $800.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior notes due March 15, 2023 and the redemption of all of the 11.625% senior subordinated notes totaling $450.0 million.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P41_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2013, in connection with all of these financing activities, we incurred approximately $28.6 million of financing costs, of which $3.6 million was expensed.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P41_S5	In addition, we expensed $17.8 million of previously-deferred financing costs as well as a $26.2 million early extinguishment premium and $8.7 million of unamortized original issue discount associated with the 11.625% senior subordinated notes.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P41_S6	All of these write-offs were included in write-off of financing costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P41_S7	See Note 13 for additional information on activities associated with our debt.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P42_S0	We record commission revenue on real estate sales generally upon close of escrow or transfer of title, except when future contingencies exist.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P42_S1	Real estate commissions on leases are generally recorded in revenue when all obligations under the commission agreement are satisfied.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P43_S0	Terms and conditions of a commission agreement may include, but are not limited to, execution of a signed lease agreement and future contingencies including tenant occupancy, payment of a deposit or payment of a first month s rent (or a combination thereof).
1138118_14_ITEM8_P43_S1	As some of these conditions are outside of our control and are often not clearly defined, judgment must be exercised in determining when such required events have occurred in order to recognize revenue.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P44_S0	A typical commission agreement provides that we earn a portion of a lease commission upon the execution of the lease agreement by the tenant and landlord, with the remaining portion(s) of the lease commission earned at a later date, usually upon tenant occupancy or payment of rent.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P44_S1	The existence of any significant future contingencies results in the delay of recognition of corresponding revenue until such contingencies are satisfied.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P44_S2	For example, if we do not earn all or a portion of the lease commission until the tenant pays its first month s rent, and the lease agreement provides the tenant with a free rent period, we delay revenue recognition until rent is paid by the tenant.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P45_S0	Property management revenues are generally based upon percentages of the revenue or base rent generated by the entities managed or the square footage managed.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P45_S1	These fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related management agreements.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P46_S0	We account for certain reimbursements (primarily salaries and related charges) mainly related to our facilities and property management operations as revenue.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P46_S1	Reimbursement revenue is recognized when the underlying reimbursable costs are incurred.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P47_S0	Investment management fees are based predominantly upon a percentage of the equity deployed on behalf of our limited partners.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P47_S1	Fees related to our indirect investment management programs are based upon a percentage of the fair value of those investments.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P47_S2	These fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related investment management agreements.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P48_S0	Our Global Investment Management segment earns performance-based incentive fees with regard to many of its investments.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P48_S1	Such revenue is recognized at the end of the measurement periods when the conditions of the applicable incentive fee arrangements have been satisfied and following the expiration of any potential claw back provision.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P48_S2	With many of these investments, our Global Investment Management professionals have participation interests in such incentive fees, which are commonly referred to as carried interest.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P48_S3	This carried interest expense is generally accrued for based upon the probability of such performance-based incentive fees being earned over the related vesting period.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P48_S4	In addition, our Global Investment Management segment also earns success-based transaction fees with regard to buying or selling properties on behalf of certain funds and separate accounts.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P48_S5	Such revenue is recognized at the completion of a successful transaction and is not subject to any claw back provision.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P49_S0	Appraisal fees are recorded after services have been rendered.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P49_S1	and we have no significant remaining obligations for performance in connection with the transaction, while loan servicing fees are recorded in revenue as monthly principal and interest payments are collected from mortgagors.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P49_S2	Other commissions, consulting fees and referral fees are recorded as revenue at the time the related services have been performed, unless significant future contingencies exist.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P50_S0	Development services and project management services generate fees from development and construction management projects.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P50_S1	Most development and construction management and project management assignments are subject to agreements that describe the calculation of fees and when we earn such fees.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P50_S2	The earnings terms of these agreements dictate when we recognize the related revenue.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P51_S0	Generally development fees are recognized based on the lower of the amount billed or the amount determined on a straight-line basis over the development period.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P52_S0	We may earn incentive fees for project management services based upon achievement of certain performance criteria as set forth in the project management services agreement.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P52_S1	We may earn incentive development fees by reaching specified timetable, leasing, budget or value creation targets, as defined in the relevant development services agreement.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P52_S2	Certain incentive development fees allow us to share in the fair value of the developed real estate asset above cost.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P52_S3	This sharing creates additional revenue potential to us with no exposure to loss other than opportunity cost.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P52_S4	We recognize such fees when the specified target is attained and fees are deemed collectible.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P53_S0	We record deferred income to the extent that cash payments have been received in accordance with the terms of underlying agreements, but such amounts have not yet met the criteria for revenue recognition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P53_S1	We recognize such revenues when the appropriate criteria are met.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P54_S0	In establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables, we make assumptions with respect to future collectability.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P54_S1	Our assumptions are based on an assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends, including the aging of receivables balances.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P54_S2	In addition to these assessments, in general, outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are more than 180 days overdue are evaluated for collectability and fully provided for if deemed uncollectible.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P55_S0	Historically, our credit losses have generally been insignificant.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P55_S1	However, estimating losses requires significant judgment, and conditions may change or new information may become known after any periodic evaluation.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P55_S2	As a result, actual credit losses may differ from our estimates.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P56_S0	Real Estate Classification and Impairment Evaluation We classify real estate in accordance with the criteria of the Property, Plant and Equipment Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 360) as follows: (i) real estate held for sale, which includes completed assets or land for sale in its present condition that meet all of Topic 360 s held for sale criteria, (ii) real estate under development (current), which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of within one year of the balance sheet date; (iii) real estate under development (non-current), which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of more than one year from the balance sheet date; or (iv) real estate held for investment, which consists of land on which development activities have not yet commenced and completed assets or land held for disposition that do not meet the held for sale criteria.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P56_S1	Any asset reclassified from real estate held for sale to real estate under development (current or non-current) or real estate held for investment is recorded individually at the lower of its fair value at the date of the reclassification or its carrying amount before it was classified as held for sale, adjusted (in the case of real estate held for investment) for any depreciation that would have been recognized had the asset been continuously classified as real estate held for investment.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P56_S2	Real estate held for sale is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P56_S3	If an asset s fair value less cost to sell, based on discounted future cash flows, management estimates or market comparisons, is less than its carrying amount, an allowance is recorded against the asset.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P56_S4	Real estate under development and real estate held for investment are carried at cost less depreciation, as applicable.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P56_S5	Buildings and improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, generally up to 39 years.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P56_S6	Tenant improvements included in real estate held for investment are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or terms of the respective leases.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P56_S7	Land improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, up to 15 years.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P56_S8	Real estate under development and real estate held for investment are evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset are less than the asset s carrying amount.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P56_S9	The amount of the impairment loss, if any, is calculated as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value, which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, management estimates or market comparisons.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P57_S0	Cost Capitalization and Allocation When acquiring, developing and constructing real estate assets, we capitalize recoverable costs.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P57_S1	Capitalization begins when the activities related to development have begun and ceases when activities are substantially complete and the asset is available for occupancy.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P57_S2	Recoverable costs capitalized include pursuit costs, or pre-acquisition/pre-construction costs, taxes and insurance, interest, development and construction costs and costs of incidental operations.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P58_S0	We do not capitalize any internal costs when acquiring, developing and constructing real estate assets.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P58_S1	We expense transaction costs for acquisitions that qualify as a business in accordance with the Business Combinations Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 805).
1138118_14_ITEM8_P58_S2	Pursuit costs capitalized in connection with a potential development project that we have determined not to pursue are written off in the period that determination is made.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P59_S0	At times, we purchase bulk land that we intend to sell or develop in phases.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P59_S1	The land basis allocated to each phase is based on the relative estimated fair value of the phases before construction.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P60_S0	attributed to a certain phase or the improvements benefit more than one phase, we allocate the costs between the phases based on their relative estimated sales values, where practicable, or other value methods as appropriate under the circumstances.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P60_S1	Relative allocations of the costs are revised as the sales value estimates are revised.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P61_S0	When acquiring real estate with existing buildings, we allocate the purchase price between land, land improvements, building and intangibles related to in-place leases, if any, based on their relative fair values.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P61_S1	The fair values of acquired land and buildings are determined based on an estimated discounted future cash flow model with lease-up assumptions as if the building was vacant upon acquisition.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P61_S2	The fair value of in-place leases includes the value of lease intangibles for above or below-market rents and tenant origination costs, determined on a lease by lease basis.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P61_S3	The capitalized values for both lease intangibles and tenant origination costs are amortized over the term of the underlying leases.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P61_S4	Amortization related to lease intangibles is recorded as either an increase to or a reduction of rental income and amortization for tenant origination costs is recorded to amortization expense.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P62_S0	Disposition of Real Estate Gains on disposition of real estate are recognized upon sale of the underlying project.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P62_S1	We evaluate each real estate sale transaction to determine if it qualifies for gain recognition under the full accrual method.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P62_S2	If the transaction does not meet the criteria for the full accrual method of profit recognition based on our assessment, we account for a sale based on an appropriate deferral method determined by the nature and extent of the buyer s investment and our continuing involvement.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P63_S0	Discontinued Operations Topic 360 extends the reporting of a discontinued operation to a component of an entity, and further requires that a component be classified as a discontinued operation if the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P64_S0	As defined in Topic 360, a component of an entity comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the rest of the entity.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P64_S1	Because each of our consolidated real estate assets is generally accounted for in a discrete subsidiary, many constitute a component of an entity under Topic 360, increasing the likelihood that the disposition of assets that we hold for sale in the ordinary course of business must be reported as a discontinued operation unless we have significant continuing involvement in the operations of the asset after its disposition.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P64_S2	Furthermore, operating profits and losses on such assets are required to be recognized and reported as operating profits and losses on discontinued operations in the periods in which they occur.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P65_S0	The costs of business promotion and advertising are expensed as incurred.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P65_S1	Business promotion and advertising costs of $49.4 million, $43.7 million and $42.5 million were included in operating, administrative and other expenses for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P66_S0	The financial statements of subsidiaries located outside the U.S. are generally measured using the local currency as the functional currency.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P66_S1	The assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date, and income and expenses are translated at the average monthly rate.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P66_S2	The resulting translation adjustments are included in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of equity.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P67_S0	Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the results of operations.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P67_S1	The aggregate transaction losses included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $12.6 million, $3.6 million and $0.4 million, respectively.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P68_S0	As required by FASB ASC Topic 815 Derivatives and Hedging , we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P68_S1	We do not net derivatives on our balance sheet.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P68_S2	The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P69_S0	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P69_S1	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P69_S2	Derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P70_S0	Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P71_S0	We may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of our risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or we elect not to apply hedge accounting.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P71_S1	In all cases, we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and, accordingly, do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P72_S0	Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income (loss).
1138118_14_ITEM8_P72_S1	In the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, accumulated other comprehensive loss consists of foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized gains (losses) on interest rate swaps and interest rate caps, unrealized holding gains on available for sale securities and other pension liability adjustments.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P72_S2	Foreign currency translation adjustments exclude any income tax effect given that earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries are deemed to be reinvested for an indefinite period of time (see Note 16).
1138118_14_ITEM8_P73_S0	Marketable Securities We account for investments in marketable debt and equity securities in accordance with the Investments Debt and Equity Securities Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 320).
1138118_14_ITEM8_P73_S1	We determine the appropriate classification of debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P74_S0	Marketable securities we acquire with the intent to generate a profit from short-term movements in market prices are classified as trading securities.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P74_S1	Debt securities are classified as held to maturity when we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P74_S2	Marketable equity and debt securities not classified as trading or held to maturity are classified as available for sale.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P75_S0	Trading securities are carried at their fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in net income.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P75_S1	Available for sale securities are carried at their fair value and any difference between cost and fair value is recorded as unrealized gain or loss, net of income taxes, and is reported as accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated statement of equity.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P76_S0	Premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the effective interest method.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P76_S1	Realized gains and losses and declines in value expected to be other-than-temporary on available for sale securities have not been significant.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P77_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P77_S1	Interest and dividends on securities classified as available for sale are included in interest income.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P78_S0	Warehouse Receivables Our wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE Capital Markets is a Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) approved Multifamily Program Plus Seller/Servicer and an approved Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) Aggregation and Negotiated Transaction Seller/Servicer.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P78_S1	In addition, CBRE Capital Markets wholly-owned subsidiary Multifamily Capital is an approved Fannie Mae Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS) Seller/Servicer and CBRE Capital Markets wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE HMF is a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) approved Non-Supervised Federal Housing Authority (FHA) Title II Mortgagee, an approved Multifamily Accelerated Processing (MAP) lender and an approved Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) issuer of mortgage-backed securities (MBS).
1138118_14_ITEM8_P79_S0	Under these arrangements, before loans are originated through proceeds from warehouse lines of credit, we obtain either a contractual loan purchase commitment from either Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae or a confirmed forward trade commitment for the issuance and purchase of a Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae MBS that will be secured by the loans.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P79_S1	The warehouse lines of credit are generally repaid within a one-month period when Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae buys the loans or upon settlement of the Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae MBS, while we retain the servicing rights.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P80_S0	Loans are funded at the prevailing market rates.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P81_S0	We elect the fair value option for all warehouse receivables.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P81_S1	At December 31, 2013 and 2012, all of the warehouse receivables included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were either under commitment to be purchased by Freddie Mac or had confirmed forward trade commitments for the issuance and purchase of Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae mortgage backed securities that will be secured by the underlying loans.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P82_S0	In connection with the origination and sale of mortgage loans with servicing rights retained, we record servicing assets or liabilities based on the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights on the date the loans are sold.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P82_S1	We also assume or purchase certain servicing assets.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P82_S2	Servicing assets are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value in other intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are amortized in proportion to and over the estimated period that net servicing income is expected to be received based on projections and timing of estimated future net cash flows.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P82_S3	Our recording of mortgage servicing rights at their fair value resulted in net gains, which have been reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P82_S4	The amount of mortgage servicing rights recognized during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 was as follows (dollars in thousands): Mortgage servicing rights do not actively trade in an open market with readily available observable prices; therefore, fair value is determined based on certain assumptions and judgments, including the estimation of the present value of future cash flows realized from servicing the underlying mortgage loans.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P83_S0	The assumptions used are subject to change based on management s judgments and estimates of changes in future cash flows and interest rates, among other things.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P83_S1	The key assumptions used during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 in measuring fair value were as follows:
1138118_14_ITEM8_P83_S2	The estimated fair value of our mortgage servicing rights was $203.6 million and $165.4 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P83_S3	We did not incur any impairment charges related to our servicing rights during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 or 2011.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P83_S4	Included in revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations are contractually specified servicing fees from loans serviced for others of $55.2 million, $40.0 million and $28.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively and late fees/ancillary income earned from loans serviced for others of $1.9 million, $0.8 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P84_S0	Accounting for Broker Draws As part of our recruitment efforts relative to new U.S. brokers, we offer a transitional broker draw arrangement.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P84_S1	Our broker draw arrangements generally last until such time as a broker s pipeline of business is sufficient to allow him or her to earn sustainable commissions.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P85_S0	This program is intended to provide the broker with a minimal amount of cash flow to allow adequate time for his or her training as well as time for him or her to develop business relationships.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P85_S1	Similar to traditional salaries, the broker draws are paid irrespective of the actual revenues generated by the broker.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P85_S2	Often these broker draws represent the only form of compensation received by the broker.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P85_S3	Furthermore, it is not our general policy to pursue collection of unearned broker draws paid under this arrangement.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P85_S4	As a result, we have concluded that broker draws are economically equivalent to salaries paid and accordingly charge them to compensation as incurred.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P86_S0	The broker is also entitled to earn a commission on completed revenue transactions.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P86_S1	This amount is calculated as the commission that would have been payable under our full commission program, less any amounts previously paid to the broker in the form of a draw.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P87_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We account for all employee awards under the fair value recognition provisions of the Compensation Stock Compensation Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 718).
1138118_14_ITEM8_P87_S1	Topic 718 requires the measurement of compensation cost at the grant date, based upon the estimated fair value of the award, and requires amortization of the related expense over the employee s requisite service period.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P87_S2	See Note 15 for additional information on our stock-based compensation plans.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P88_S0	Basic income per share attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. is computed by dividing net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P88_S1	The computation of diluted income per share attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. generally further assumes the dilutive effect of potential common shares, which include stock options and certain contingently issuable shares.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P88_S2	Contingently issuable shares consist of non-vested stock awards.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P89_S0	Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with the Accounting for Income Taxes Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 740).
1138118_14_ITEM8_P90_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P90_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P90_S2	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P91_S0	Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P92_S0	Self-Insurance Our wholly-owned captive insurance company, which is subject to applicable insurance rules and regulations, insures our exposure related to workers compensation insurance provided to employees and we purchase excess coverage from an unrelated insurance carrier.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P92_S1	We purchase general liability and automotive insurance through an unrelated insurance carrier.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P92_S2	The captive insurance company reinsures the related deductibles.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P92_S3	The captive insurance company also insures deductibles relating to professional indemnity claims.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P92_S4	Given the nature of these types of claims, it may take several years for resolution and determination of the cost of these claims.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P92_S5	We are required to estimate the cost of these claims in our financial statements.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P92_S6	The estimates that we utilize to record our potential losses on claims are inherently subjective, and actual claims could differ from amounts recorded, which could result in increased or decreased expense in future periods.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P92_S7	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, our reserves for claims under these insurance programs were $65.7 million and $48.4 million, respectively, which were included in other current and other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P92_S8	Of these amounts, $2.2 million and $11.9 million, respectively, represented our estimated current liabilities as of December 31, 2013 and 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P92_S9	Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Limited Life Subsidiaries As of December 31, 2013, the estimated settlement value of non-controlling interests in our consolidated limited life subsidiaries was $5.4 million, which approximates the carrying value, and which was included in non-controlling interests in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P92_S10	As of December 31, 2012, the estimated settlement value of non-controlling interests in our consolidated limited life subsidiaries was $68.4 million, as compared to the carrying value of $61.7 million, which was included in non-controlling interests in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P93_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements In March 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2013-05, Foreign Currency Matters (Topic 830): Parent s Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P93_S1	This ASU states that when a reporting entity (parent) ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business (other than a sale of in substance real estate or conveyance of oil and gas mineral rights) within a foreign entity, the parent is required to apply the guidance in Subtopic 830-30 to release any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P93_S2	Accordingly, the cumulative translation adjustment should be released into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P94_S0	beginning after December 15, 2013, with early adoption permitted.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P94_S1	We do not believe the adoption of this update will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P95_S0	In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P95_S1	This ASU states that an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward, except as follows: To the extent a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position or the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require the entity to use, and the entity does not intend to use, the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P95_S2	This ASU applies to all entities that have unrecognized tax benefits when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists at the reporting date.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P95_S3	This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013, with early adoption permitted.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P95_S4	This ASU should be applied prospectively to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist at the effective date, with retrospective application permitted.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P95_S5	We do not believe the adoption of this update will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P96_S0	Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2011 and 2012 financial statements to conform with the 2013 presentation.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P97_S0	In 2011, we acquired the majority of the real estate investment management business of Netherlands-based ING.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P97_S1	The acquisitions included substantially all of ING s REIM operations in Europe and Asia, as well as substantially all of CRES, its U.S.-based global real estate listed securities business (collectively referred to as ING REIM) along with certain CRES co-investments from ING and additional interests in other funds managed by ING REIM Europe and ING REIM Asia.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P97_S2	Upon completion of the acquisitions (collectively referred to as the REIM Acquisitions), ING REIM became part of our Global Investment Management segment (which conducts business through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, CBRE Global Investors, an independently operated business segment).
1138118_14_ITEM8_P97_S3	We completed the REIM Acquisitions in order to significantly enhance our ability to meet the needs of institutional investors across global markets with a full spectrum of investment programs and strategies.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P97_S4	We secured borrowings of $800.0 million of term loans to finance the REIM Acquisitions (see Note 13).
1138118_14_ITEM8_P97_S5	Of this amount, $400.0 million was drawn on June 30, 2011 to finance the CRES portion of the REIM Acquisitions, which closed on July 1, 2011.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P97_S6	On August 31, 2011, we drew down the remaining $400.0 million, part of which was used to finance the ING REIM Asia portion of the REIM Acquisitions, which closed on October 3, 2011, and the remainder, along with cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility, was used to finance the ING REIM Europe portion of the REIM Acquisitions, which closed on October 31, 2011.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P97_S7	The following represents a summary of the purchase price for the REIM Acquisitions (dollars in thousands):
1138118_14_ITEM8_P98_S0	In connection with our acquisition of CRES, we acquired CRES co-investments from ING in three funds (CRES Funds) for an aggregate purchase price of $58.6 million, which has been included above.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P98_S1	We determined that the CRES Funds were not VIEs and accordingly determined the method of accounting based upon voting control.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P98_S2	The limited partners/members of the CRES Funds lack substantive rights that would overcome our presumption of control.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P98_S3	Accordingly, we began consolidating the CRES Funds as of the acquisition date of July 1, 2011.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P98_S4	In connection with the REIM Acquisitions, we also acquired three ING REIM Asia co-investments from ING for an aggregate amount of $13.9 million on October 3, 2011 and several ING REIM Europe co-investments, including one for $7.4 million on October 31, 2011, and nine additional co-investments for an aggregate amount of $34.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P99_S0	In January 2012, one of the CRES Funds (CBRE Clarion U.S., L.P.) was converted to a registered mutual fund, the CBRE Clarion Long/Short Fund (the Fund).
1138118_14_ITEM8_P99_S1	As a result of this triggering event, we determined that the Fund became a VIE and that we were not the primary beneficiary.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P99_S2	Accordingly, in the first quarter of 2012, the Fund was deconsolidated from our consolidated financial statements and we recorded an investment in available for sale securities of $14.3 million.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P99_S3	No gain or loss was recognized in our consolidated statement of operations as a result of this deconsolidation.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P99_S4	We continue to act as the Fund s adviser, make investment decisions for the Fund and review, supervise and administer the Fund s investment program.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P100_S0	The consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 includes revenue, operating income and net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. of $84.6 million, $15.7 million and $9.1 million, respectively, attributable to the REIM Acquisitions.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P100_S1	This does not include direct transaction and integration costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2011 of $66.7 million in connection with the REIM Acquisitions.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P100_S2	Unaudited pro forma results, assuming the REIM Acquisitions had occurred as of January 1, 2011 for purposes of the 2011 pro forma disclosures, are presented below.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P100_S3	They include certain adjustments, including $17.2 million of increased amortization expense as a result of intangible assets acquired in the REIM Acquisitions, $19.2 million of additional interest expense as a result of debt incurred to finance the REIM Acquisitions, the removal of $73.0 million of direct costs incurred by us and ING related to the REIM Acquisitions, and the tax impact of the pro forma adjustments.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P100_S4	These unaudited pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of what operating results would have been had the REIM Acquisitions occurred on January 1, 2011 and may not be indicative of future operating results (dollars in thousands, except share data):
1138118_14_ITEM8_P101_S0	Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) A consolidated subsidiary (the Venture) in our Global Investment Management segment has sponsored investments by third-party investors in certain commercial properties through the formation of tenant-in-common limited liability companies and Delaware Statutory Trusts (collectively referred to as the Entities) that are owned by the third-party investors.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P101_S1	The Venture also has formed and is a member of a limited liability company for each property that serves as master tenant (Master Tenant).
1138118_14_ITEM8_P101_S2	Each Master Tenant leases the property from the Entities through a master lease agreement.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P101_S3	Pursuant to the master lease agreements, the Master Tenant has the power to direct the day-to-day asset management activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the Entities.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P101_S4	As a result, the Entities were deemed to be VIEs since the third-party investors holding the equity investment at risk in the Entities do not direct the day-to-day activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the properties held by the Entities.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P101_S5	The Venture has made and may continue to make voluntary contributions to each of these properties to support their operations beyond the cash flow generated by the properties themselves.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P101_S6	As of the most recent reconsideration date, such financial support has been significant enough that the Venture was deemed to be the primary beneficiary of each Entity.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P101_S7	No financial support was provided by the Venture to the Entities during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P101_S8	During both the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Venture funded $0.2 million of financial support to the Entities.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P101_S9	The Entities were initially consolidated by the Venture upon adoption of ASU 2009-17, Consolidations (Topic 810): Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved With Variable Interest Entities, on January 1, 2010.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P101_S10	The Entities assets and associated mortgage notes payable aggregated $251.0 million and $221.5 million, respectively, and were recorded based on their fair value at adoption.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P101_S11	We did not recognize a gain or loss on the initial consolidation of these Entities.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P101_S12	The assets of the Entities are the sole collateral for the mortgage notes payable and other liabilities of the Entities and as such, the creditors and equity investors of these Entities have no recourse to our assets held outside of these Entities.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P102_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2011, five of the original eight commercial properties were sold.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P102_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2012, an additional Entity was consolidated during the first quarter and subsequently sold in the fourth quarter.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P102_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2013, another one of the original eight commercial properties was sold.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P102_S3	Operating results relating to the Entities for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 include the following (dollars in thousands): Investments in real estate of $39.9 million and $58.8 million and nonrecourse mortgage notes payable of $41.7 million ($0.9 million of which is current) and $61.7 million ($1.3 million of which is current) are included in real estate assets held for investment and notes payable on real estate, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P102_S4	In addition, non-controlling deficits of $1.8 million and $2.7 million in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, are attributable to the Entities.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P103_S0	We hold variable interests in certain VIEs in our Global Investment Management and Development Services segments which are not consolidated as it was determined that we are not the primary beneficiary.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P103_S1	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, our maximum exposure to loss related to the VIE s which are not consolidated was as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_14_ITEM8_P104_S0	The Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 820) defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P104_S1	Topic 820 also establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P104_S2	This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P104_S3	The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:
1138118_14_ITEM8_P105_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P106_S0	Level 2 Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P107_S0	Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P107_S1	This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P107_S2	There were no significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P108_S0	The following tables present the fair value of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2013 and 2012:
1138118_14_ITEM8_P109_S0	Fair value measurements for our available for sale securities are obtained from independent pricing services which utilize observable market data that may include quoted market prices, dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. treasury yield curve, trading levels, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the instrument s terms and conditions.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P110_S0	The trading securities and securities sold, not yet purchased are primarily in the U.S. and are generally valued at the last reported sales price on the day of valuation or, if no sales occurred on the valuation date, at the mean of the bid and asked prices on such date.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P110_S1	The fair values of the warehouse receivables are calculated based on already locked in security buy prices.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P110_S2	At December 31, 2013 and 2012, all of the warehouse receivables included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were either under commitment to be purchased by Freddie Mac or had confirmed forward trade commitments for the issuance and purchase of Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae mortgage backed securities that will be secured by the underlying loans (See Note 2).
1138118_14_ITEM8_P110_S3	These assets are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as all inputs are readily observable.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P111_S0	The valuation of interest rate swaps is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P111_S1	This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P112_S0	The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P112_S1	The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate forward curves.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P113_S0	To comply with the provisions of Topic 820, we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P114_S0	In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we have considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P114_S1	In conjunction with our adoption of ASU 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs , we made an accounting policy election to measure the credit risk of our derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements on a net basis by counterparty portfolio.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P114_S2	Although we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by us and our counterparties.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P114_S3	However, as of December 31, 2013, we have determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P114_S4	As a result, we have determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P115_S0	The following tables are a summary of our available for sale securities (dollars in thousands):
1138118_14_ITEM8_P116_S0	The net carrying value and estimated fair value of debt securities at December 31, 2013, by contractual maturity, are shown below.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P117_S0	Actual repayment dates may differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay obligations.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P118_S0	We did not record any significant dividends or interest income related to marketable securities for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P118_S1	The portion of net gains and losses for the year ended December 31, 2013 relating to trading securities still held at December 31, 2013 is calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_14_ITEM8_P119_S0	The portion of net gains and losses for the year ended December 31, 2012 relating to trading securities still held at December 31, 2012 is calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_14_ITEM8_P120_S0	The portion of net gains and losses for the year ended December 31, 2011 relating to trading securities still held at December 31, 2011 is calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_14_ITEM8_P121_S0	The following non-recurring fair value measurements were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 (dollars in thousands):
1138118_14_ITEM8_P122_S0	The fair value measurements employed for our impairment evaluations were generally based on third-party information available in non-active markets (such as third-party appraisals and offers received from third parties) as well as a discounted cash flow approach and/or review of comparable activities in the market place.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P122_S1	Inputs used in these evaluations included risk-free rates of return, estimated risk premiums as well as other economic variables.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P123_S0	Other Intangible Assets During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a non-amortizable intangible asset impairment of $98.1 million in our Global Investment Management segment.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P123_S1	This non-cash write-off related to a decrease in value of our open-end funds, primarily in Europe.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P123_S2	These funds have experienced a decline in assets under management, as the business mix shifts toward separate accounts, consistent with market movements following the extended financial crisis in Europe, which has resulted in project sales and planned liquidations of certain funds.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P124_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded a non-amortizable intangible asset impairment of $19.8 million in our EMEA segment.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P124_S1	This non-cash write-off related to the discontinuation of the use of a trade name in the United Kingdom (U.K.).
1138118_14_ITEM8_P124_S2	All of our impairment charges related to non-amortizable intangible assets were included as a separate line item in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P124_S3	Property and Equipment During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded an asset impairment of $5.8 million in our Americas segment.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P124_S4	This non-cash write-off resulted from the decision to abandon certain modules of a software platform that were being developed in the U.S. as a result of a change in strategy.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P124_S5	This impairment charge was included within operating, administrative and other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P125_S0	Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded write-downs in our Global Investment Management of $4.1 million, of which $1.0 million were attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P125_S1	These write-downs were primarily driven by a decrease in the estimated holding period of certain assets.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P125_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded write-downs of $3.9 million, of which $0.6 million were attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P125_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2012, $3.8 million of the investment write-downs were reported in our Global Investment Management segment and $0.1 million were reported in our Development Services segment.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P125_S4	These write-downs were primarily driven by a decrease in the estimated holding period of certain assets and continued challenging market conditions.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P125_S5	During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded write-downs of $5.6 million, of which $0.1 million were attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P125_S6	During the year ended December 31, 2011, $5.5 million of the investment write-downs were reported in our Global Investment Management segment and $0.1 million were reported in our Development Services segment.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P125_S7	These write-downs were primarily driven by a decrease in the estimated holding period of certain assets.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P125_S8	All of our impairment charges related to investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries were included in equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P125_S9	When we performed our impairment analysis, the assumptions utilized reflected our outlook for the commercial real estate industry and the expected impact on our business.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P126_S0	Real Estate During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded impairment charges of $26.5 million on real estate held for investment.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P126_S1	Of this amount, $15.9 million was attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P126_S2	These impairment charges were driven by a decrease in the estimated holding period of certain assets and continued challenging market conditions.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P126_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded charges of $4.3 million, including provisions for losses on real estate held for sale and impairment charges on real estate held for investment.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P126_S4	Of this amount, $0.3 million was attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P127_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded provisions for losses on real estate held for sale of $2.6 million.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P127_S1	These charges reduced the carrying value of certain assets to their fair value, less cost to sell, primarily due to reduced selling prices resulting from a decrease in the estimated holding period of certain assets.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P127_S2	Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded impairment charges of $1.7 million related to real estate held for investment, which were attributable to continued challenging market conditions.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P127_S3	All of the abovementioned charges were reported in our Development Services segment, with the exception of a $9.3 million impairment charge reported in our Global Investment Management segment during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P127_S4	All of the abovementioned charges were included within operating, administrative and other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, with the exception of a $1.3 million provision for loss on real estate for the year ended December 31, 2011, which was included within activity from discontinued operations.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P128_S0	If conditions in the broader economy, commercial real estate industry, specific markets or product types in which we operate worsen, we may be required to evaluate additional projects or re-evaluate previously impaired projects for potential impairment.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P128_S1	These evaluations could result in additional impairment charges.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P129_S0	FASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P129_S1	Our financial instruments, excluding those included in the preceding fair value tables above, are as follows: Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash : These balances include cash and cash equivalents as well as restricted cash with maturities of less than three months.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P129_S2	The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P130_S0	Receivables, less Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: Due to their short-term nature, fair value approximates carrying value.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P130_S1	Warehouse Receivables: These balances are carried at fair value based on market prices at the balance sheet date.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P130_S2	Trading and Available for Sale Securities: These investments are carried at their fair value.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P130_S3	Securities Sold, not yet Purchased: These liabilities are carried at their fair value.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P130_S4	Short-Term Borrowings : The majority of this balance represents our warehouse lines of credit and our revolving credit facility outstanding for CBRE Capital Markets.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P130_S5	Due to the short-term nature and variable interest rates of these instruments, fair value approximates carrying value (see Note 13).
1138118_14_ITEM8_P131_S0	Senior Secured Term Loans : Based upon information from third-party banks, the estimated fair value of our senior secured term loans was approximately $687.6 million and $1.6 billion at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P131_S1	Their actual carrying value totaled $685.3 million and $1.6 billion at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively (see Note 13).
1138118_14_ITEM8_P132_S0	Interest Rate Swaps : These liabilities are carried at their fair value as calculated by using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative (see Note 6).
1138118_14_ITEM8_P132_S1	5.00% Senior Notes : Based on dealers quotes, the estimated fair value of our 5.00% senior notes was $769.4 million at December 31, 2013.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P132_S2	Their actual carrying value totaled $800.0 million at December 31, 2013 (see Note 13).
1138118_14_ITEM8_P133_S0	6.625% Senior Notes : Based on dealers quotes, the estimated fair value of our 6.625% senior notes was $372.8 million and $385.0 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P133_S1	Their actual carrying value totaled $350.0 million at both December 31, 2013 and 2012 (see Note 13).
1138118_14_ITEM8_P134_S0	11.625% Senior Subordinated Notes : Based on dealers quotes, the estimated fair value of our 11.625% senior subordinated notes was $488.8 million at December 31, 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P134_S1	Their actual carrying value totaled $440.5 million at December 31, 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P134_S2	We redeemed these notes in full on June 15, 2013 (see Note 13).
1138118_14_ITEM8_P134_S3	Notes Payable on Real Estate: As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the carrying value of our notes payable on real estate was $130.5 million and $326.0 million, respectively (see Note 12).
1138118_14_ITEM8_P135_S0	These borrowings generally have floating interest rates at spreads over a market rate index.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P136_S0	It is likely that some portion of our notes payable on real estate have fair values lower than actual carrying values.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P136_S1	Given our volume of notes payable and the cost involved in estimating their fair value, we determined it was not practicable to do so.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P136_S2	Additionally, only $4.0 million and $13.9 million of these notes payable were recourse to us as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P137_S0	Derivative Financial Instruments We are exposed to certain risks arising from both our business operations and economic conditions.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P137_S1	We manage economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of our debt funding and by using derivative financial instruments.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P137_S2	Specifically, we enter into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P137_S3	Our derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of our known or expected cash payments principally related to our borrowings.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P138_S0	We do not net derivatives on the balance sheet.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P138_S1	Our objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P138_S2	To accomplish this objective, we primarily use interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P139_S0	In March 2011, we entered into five interest rate swap agreements, all with effective dates in October 2011, and immediately designated them as cash flow hedges.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P139_S1	The purpose of these interest rate swap agreements is to hedge potential changes to our cash flows due to the variable interest nature of our senior secured term loan facilities.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P139_S2	The total notional amount of these interest rate swap agreements is $400.0 million, with $200.0 million expiring in October 2017 and $200.0 million expiring in September 2019.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P140_S0	The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P140_S1	There was no significant hedge ineffectiveness for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P141_S0	The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the balance sheet and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P141_S1	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, there was $29.0 million and $48.0 million, respectively, included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets related to these interest rate swaps, which will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on our senior secured term loan facilities.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P141_S2	During the next twelve months, we estimate that $11.7 million will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P141_S3	The following table presents the fair value of our interest rate swaps as well as their classification on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 (dollars in thousands):
1138118_14_ITEM8_P141_S4	The following table presents the effect of our interest rate swaps on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 (dollars in thousands):
1138118_14_ITEM8_P142_S0	The following table presents the effect of our interest rate swaps on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 (dollars in thousands):
1138118_14_ITEM8_P143_S0	The following table presents the effect of our interest rate swaps on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 (dollars in thousands):
1138118_14_ITEM8_P144_S0	We have agreements with some of our derivative counterparties that contain a provision where (1) if we default on any of our indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then we could also be declared in default on our derivative obligations; or (2) we could be declared in default on our derivative obligations if repayment of the underlying indebtedness is accelerated by the lender due to our default on the indebtedness.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P144_S1	As of December 31, 2013, the fair value of derivatives related to these agreements was a net liability position of $30.0 million, which includes accrued interest but excludes any adjustment for nonperformance risk.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P144_S2	As of December 31, 2013, we have not posted any collateral related to these agreements and had not breached any of the provisions discussed above.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P144_S3	Had we breached any of the provisions discussed above at December 31, 2013, we may have been required to settle our obligations under the agreements at their termination value of $30.1 million.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P145_S0	From time to time, we also enter into interest rate swap and cap agreements in order to limit our interest expense related to our notes payable on real estate.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P145_S1	If any of these agreements are not designated as effective hedges, then they are marked to market each period with the change in fair value recognized in current period earnings.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P146_S0	The net impact on our earnings resulting from gains and/or losses on interest rate swap and cap agreements associated with notes payable on real estate has not been significant.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P146_S1	We routinely monitor our exposure to currency exchange rate changes in connection with transactions and sometimes enter into foreign currency exchange option and forward contracts to limit our exposure to such transactions, as appropriate.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P146_S2	In the normal course of business, we also sometimes utilize derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange exposure resulting from intercompany loans, expected cash flow and earnings.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P147_S0	2012 and 2011, respectively, resulting from net losses on foreign currency exchange option and forward contracts.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P147_S1	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we did not have any foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P147_S2	We also enter into loan commitments that relate to the origination or acquisition of commercial mortgage loans that will be held for resale.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P147_S3	FASB ASC Topic 815 requires that these commitments be recorded at their fair values as derivatives.

1138118_14_ITEM8_P194_S0	Commitments and Contingencies We are a party to a number of pending or threatened lawsuits arising out of, or incident to, our ordinary course of business.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P194_S1	Our management believes that any losses in excess of the amounts accrued arising from such lawsuits are remote, but that litigation is inherently uncertain and there is the potential for a material adverse effect on our financial statements if one or more matters are resolved in a particular period in an amount in excess of that anticipated by management.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P195_S0	Our leases generally relate to office space that we occupy, have varying terms and expire through 2030.

1138118_14_ITEM8_P196_S0	Total minimum payments for noncancellable operating leases were not reduced by the minimum sublease rental income of $11.0 million due in the future under noncancellable subleases.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P197_S0	Substantially all leases require us to pay maintenance costs, insurance and property taxes.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P197_S1	The composition of total rental expense under noncancellable operating leases consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_14_ITEM8_P197_S2	We had outstanding letters of credit totaling $11.1 million as of December 31, 2013, excluding letters of credit for which we have outstanding liabilities already accrued on our consolidated balance sheet related to our subsidiaries outstanding reserves for claims under certain insurance programs as well as letters of credit related to operating leases.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P197_S3	These letters of credit are primarily executed by us in the ordinary course of business and expire at varying dates through December 2014.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P197_S4	We had guarantees totaling $14.3 million as of December 31, 2013, excluding guarantees related to pension liabilities, consolidated indebtedness and other obligations for which we have outstanding liabilities already accrued on our consolidated balance sheet, and operating leases.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P197_S5	The $14.3 million partly consists of guarantees related to our defined benefit pension plans in the U.K. (in excess of our outstanding pension liability of $68.0 million as of December 31, 2013), which are continuous guarantees that will not expire until all amounts have been paid out for our pension liabilities.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P197_S6	The remainder of the guarantees mainly represents guarantees of obligations of unconsolidated subsidiaries, which expire at varying dates through June 2017, as well as various guarantees of management contracts in our operations overseas, which expire at the end of each of the respective agreements.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P197_S7	In addition, as of December 31, 2013, we had numerous completion and budget guarantees relating to development projects.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P197_S8	These guarantees are made by us in the ordinary course of our Development Services business.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P197_S9	Each of these guarantees requires us to complete construction of the relevant project within a specified timeframe and/or within a specified budget, with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P197_S10	However, we generally have guaranteed maximum price contracts with reputable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P197_S11	These contracts are intended to pass the risk to such contractors.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P197_S12	While there can be no assurance, we do not expect to incur any material losses under these guarantees.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P198_S0	In January 2008, CBRE Multifamily Capital, Inc. (CBRE MCI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBRE Capital Markets, Inc., entered into an agreement with Fannie Mae, under Fannie Mae s DUS Lender Program (DUS Program), to provide financing for multifamily housing with five or more units.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P198_S1	Under the DUS Program, CBRE MCI originates, underwrites, closes and services loans without prior approval by Fannie Mae, and in selected cases, is subject to sharing up to one-third of any losses on loans originated under the DUS Program.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P198_S2	CBRE MCI has funded loans subject to such loss sharing arrangements with unpaid principal balances of $7.8 billion at December 31, 2013.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P198_S3	Additionally, CBRE MCI has funded loans under the DUS Program that are not subject to loss sharing arrangements with unpaid principal balances of approximately $369.0 million at December 31, 2013.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P199_S0	CBRE MCI, under its agreement with Fannie Mae, must post cash reserves under formulas established by Fannie Mae to provide for sufficient capital in the event losses occur.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P200_S0	and 2012, CBRE MCI had $16.6 million and $9.1 million, respectively, of cash deposited under this reserve arrangement, and had provided approximately $13.8 million and $10.6 million, respectively, of loan loss accruals.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P201_S0	Fannie Mae s recourse under the DUS Program is limited to the assets of CBRE MCI, which totaled approximately $367.4 million (including $226.4 million of warehouse receivables, a substantial majority of which are pledged against warehouse lines of credit and are therefore not available to Fannie Mae) at December 31, 2013.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P202_S0	An important part of the strategy for our Global Investment Management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P202_S1	These co-investments typically range from 2.0% to 5.0% of the equity in a particular fund.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P202_S2	As of December 31, 2013, we had aggregate commitments of $9.4 million to fund future co-investments.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P202_S3	Additionally, an important part of our Development Services business strategy is to invest in unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries as a principal (in most cases co-investing with our clients).
1138118_14_ITEM8_P202_S4	As of December 31, 2013, we had committed to fund $25.0 million of additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries.

1138118_14_ITEM8_P203_S1	Our 2004 stock incentive plan was adopted by our board of directors and approved by our stockholders on April 21, 2004, and was amended several times subsequently, including an amendment and restatement on June 2, 2008 and an amendment on December 3, 2008.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P203_S2	However, our 2004 stock incentive plan was terminated in May 2012 in connection with the adoption of our 2012 equity incentive plan, which is described below.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P203_S3	At termination, all unissued shares from the 2004 stock incentive plan were allocated to the 2012 equity incentive plan for potential future issuance.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P204_S0	The 2004 stock incentive plan authorized the grant of stock-based awards to our employees, directors or independent contractors.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P204_S1	A total of 20,785,218 shares of our Class A common stock initially were reserved for issuance under the 2004 stock incentive plan, which increased by 10,000,000 shares to a total of 30,785,218 shares in connection with the June 2, 2008 amendment and restatement.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P204_S2	For awards granted prior to June 2, 2008 under this plan, this share reserve was reduced by one share upon grant of an option or stock appreciation right, and was reduced by 2.25 shares upon issuance of stock pursuant to other stock-based awards.

1138118_14_ITEM8_P210_S2	A summary of the status of our outstanding stock options is presented in the tables below:
1138118_14_ITEM8_P211_S0	(1) The expected to vest options are the result of applying the pre-vesting forfeiture rate assumption to total outstanding options.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P212_S0	We estimate the fair value of our options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which takes into account assumptions such as the dividend yield, the risk-free interest rate, the expected stock price volatility and the expected life of the options.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P212_S1	The total estimated grant date fair value of stock options that vested during the year ended December 31, 2013 was $0.7 million.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P212_S2	The weighted average fair value of options granted by us was $13.49 for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P212_S3	The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, utilizing the following weighted average assumptions for the year ended December 31, 2011:
1138118_14_ITEM8_P212_S4	The dividend yield assumption is excluded from the calculation, as it is our present intention to retain all earnings.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P212_S5	The expected volatility is based on a combination of our historical stock price and implied volatility.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P212_S6	The selection of implied volatility data to estimate expected volatility is based upon the availability of actively traded options on our stock.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P212_S7	The risk-free interest rate is based upon the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the options.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P212_S8	The expected life of our stock options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is based on historical experience of similar options, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P213_S0	Option valuation models require the input of subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility and expected life.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P213_S1	Because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, we do not believe that the Black-Scholes model necessarily provides a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P214_S0	Options outstanding at December 31, 2013 and their related weighted average exercise price, intrinsic value and life information is presented below: At December 31, 2013, the aggregate intrinsic value and weighted average remaining contractual life for options vested and expected to vest were $14.7 million and 1.9 years, respectively.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P214_S1	Total compensation expense related to stock options was $0.4 million, $2.3 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P215_S0	The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $31.9 million, $16.4 million and $39.9 million, respectively.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P215_S1	We recorded cash received from stock option exercises of $5.8 million, $20.3 million and $7.1 million and related tax benefit of $9.9 million, $2.9 million and $14.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

1138118_14_ITEM8_P218_S3	In respect to the adjusted EPS performance-based stock units, the award amount was granted as a target number of non-vested stock units, with the actual number of shares to be later issued (if they vest) determined by measuring the extent by which actual adjusted EPS at the end of the performance period exceeds specified adjusted EPS performance levels.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P218_S4	The actual number of shares that a grant recipient will receive may range from 0% to 200% of the target number depending on adjusted EPS performance.

1138118_14_ITEM8_P220_S1	A summary of the status of our non-vested stock awards is presented in the table below:
1138118_14_ITEM8_P221_S0	Total compensation expense related to non-vested stock awards was $48.0 million, $49.4 million and $40.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

1138118_14_ITEM8_P223_S0	Our CBRE 401(k) Plan (401(k) Plan) is a defined contribution savings plan that allows participant deferrals under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P223_S1	Most of our non-union U.S. employees, other than qualified real estate agents having the status of independent contractors under section 3508 of the Internal Revenue Code, are eligible to participate in the plan.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P223_S2	The 401(k) Plan provides for participant contributions as well as a Company match.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P223_S3	A participant is allowed to contribute to the 401(k) Plan from 1% to 75% of his or her compensation, subject to limits imposed by applicable law.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P223_S4	Effective January 1, 2007, all participants hired post January 1, 2007 vest in company match contributions 20% per year for each plan year they work 1,000 hours.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P223_S5	All participants hired before January 1, 2007 are immediately vested in company match contributions.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P223_S6	For 2011, 2012 and 2013, we contributed a 50% match on the first 3% of annual compensation (up to $150,000 of compensation) deferred by each participant.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P223_S7	In connection with the 401(k) Plan, we charged to expense $15.5 million, $12.9 million and $10.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P224_S0	Participants are entitled to invest up to 25% of their 401(k) account balance in shares of our common stock.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P224_S1	As of December 31, 2013, approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock were held as investments by participants in our 401(k) Plan.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P225_S0	We have two contributory defined benefit pension plans in the U.K.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P225_S1	The London-based firm of Hillier Parker May Rowden, which we acquired in 1998, had a contributory defined benefit pension plan.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P225_S2	A subsidiary of Insignia, which we acquired in connection with the Insignia Acquisition in 2003, also had a contributory defined benefit pension plan in the U.K.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P225_S3	Our subsidiaries based in the U.K. maintain the plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in these plans.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P225_S4	With respect to these plans, our historical policy has been to contribute annually an amount to fund pension cost as actuarially determined and as required by applicable laws and regulations.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P225_S5	Effective July 1, 2007, we reached agreements with the active members of these plans to freeze future pension plan benefits.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P225_S6	In return, the active members became eligible to enroll in a defined contribution plan.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P226_S0	The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the benefit obligation, plan assets, plan s funded status and amounts recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets for both of our defined benefit pension plans (dollars in thousands):
1138118_14_ITEM8_P227_S0	The accumulated benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans was $400.2 million and $352.2 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P227_S1	Items not yet recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost were as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_14_ITEM8_P228_S0	The estimated net actuarial loss that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic pension cost in 2014 is $2.6 million.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P229_S0	Components of net periodic pension cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive loss consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_14_ITEM8_P230_S0	Weighted average assumptions used to determine our projected benefit obligation were as follows:
1138118_14_ITEM8_P230_S1	Weighted average assumptions used to determine our net periodic pension cost were as follows: We select a discount rate by reference to yields available at our balance sheet date on U.K. AA-rated corporate bonds.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P231_S0	The corporate bond yield curve is derived by taking a government bond yield curve, based on Bank of England data and adding an amount to reflect the yield spread on AA-rated bonds over government bonds.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P231_S1	This discount rate selected is the weighted average of the yields on the resulting bond yield curve, where the weighting is based on the expected cash flow from the weighted average duration of the pension plans.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P232_S0	We review historical rates of return for equity and fixed income securities, as well as current economic conditions, to determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P232_S1	The assumed rate of return for 2013 is based on 57.2% of the portfolio being invested in equities yielding a 7.6% return, 28.1% of the portfolio being invested in an absolute return strategy fund yielding a 7.1% return and 7.0% of assets being primarily invested in corporate and government debt securities yielding a 4.7% return.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P232_S2	Consideration is given to diversification and periodic rebalancing of the portfolio based on prevailing market conditions.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P233_S0	Our pension plan weighted average asset allocations by asset category were as follows:
1138118_14_ITEM8_P234_S0	Our pension trust assets are invested with a long-term focus to achieve a return on investment that is based on levels of liquidity and investment risk that the trustees, in consultation with management believe are prudent and reasonable.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P234_S1	The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income and index linked investments consisting primarily of government debt.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P234_S2	The equity investments are diversified across U.K. and non-U.K. equities, as well as value, growth, and medium and large capitalizations.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P234_S3	The portfolio s asset mix is reviewed regularly, and the portfolio is rebalanced based on existing market conditions.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P234_S4	Investment risk is measured and monitored on a regular basis through quarterly portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements and periodic asset/liability analyses.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P234_S5	The fair value of our pension assets are comprised of the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_14_ITEM8_P235_S0	(a) The assets in this category represent investments in foreign equity and bond funds.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P235_S1	Generally, these assets are valued using bid-market valuations provided by the funds investment managers.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P236_S0	(b) The assets in this category represent investments in an absolute return strategies fund.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P236_S1	Generally, these assets are valued at the net asset value as determined by the custodian of the fund.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P237_S0	identical instruments, discounted future cash flows, independent appraisals, and market-based comparable data.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P237_S1	As such, the assets in this category have been categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P238_S0	(c) The assets in this category include investments in a liability driven investment fund and investments in commercial real estate.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P238_S1	The liability driven investment fund is a single priced fund and the fair value of the underlying assets are priced by the fund s custodian based on observable market data and therefore categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P239_S0	The investments in commercial real estate represent a property unit trust that invests in commercial real estate properties in the U.K.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P239_S1	The fair values for these investments are based on inputs obtained from broker quotes that are indicative of value and cannot be corroborated by observable market data and therefore are categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P239_S2	A summary of our pension assets measured and recorded using significant unobservable inputs is as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_14_ITEM8_P240_S0	There were no significant transfers into or out of Level 3 during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P240_S1	We expect to contribute $6.2 million to our pension plans in 2014.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P241_S0	The following is a schedule by year of benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, that are expected to be paid (dollars in thousands):
1138118_14_ITEM8_P242_S0	We also have defined contribution plans for employees in the U.K.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P242_S1	Our contributions to these plans were approximately $10.9 million, $9.6 million and $8.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P243_S0	The components of income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes consisted of the following (dollars in thousands): Our tax provision (benefit) consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_14_ITEM8_P243_S1	The following is a reconciliation stated as a percentage of pre-tax income of the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate:
1138118_14_ITEM8_P244_S0	During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, we recorded a $10.5 million, $5.3 million and $15.5 million income tax benefit in connection with stock options exercised.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P244_S1	Of this income tax benefit, $9.9 million, $2.9 million and $14.9 million was charged directly to additional paid-in capital within the equity section of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P244_S2	Cumulative tax effects of temporary differences are shown below at December 31, 2013 and 2012 (dollars in thousands):
1138118_14_ITEM8_P245_S0	As of December 31, 2013, we had U.S. federal net operating losses (NOLs) of approximately $15.4 million, translating to a deferred tax asset before valuation allowance of $5.4 million, which will begin to expire in 2023.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P245_S1	As of December 31, 2013, there were also deferred tax assets before valuation allowances of approximately $3.2 million related to state NOLs as well as $36.4 million related to foreign NOLs.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P245_S2	The state and foreign NOLs both begin to expire in 2014.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P246_S0	The utilization of NOLs may be subject to certain limitations under U.S. federal, state and foreign laws.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P246_S1	In addition, as of December 31, 2013, we had $55.1 million of foreign income tax credits that can be utilized to offset U.S. federal income taxes on foreign-sourced earnings.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P246_S2	These credits will begin to expire in 2023.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P247_S0	Management determined that as of December 31, 2013, $98.6 million of deferred tax assets do not satisfy the recognition criteria set forth in Topic 740.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P247_S1	Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been recorded for this amount.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P247_S2	If released, the entire amount would result in a benefit to continuing operations.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P247_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2013, our valuation allowance increased by approximately $22.4 million.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P247_S4	This was primarily the result of the establishment of valuation allowances of $10.2 million related to U.S. foreign tax credits, $8.7 million related to non-U.S. net operating losses and other assets, $4.7 million related to U.S. net operating losses and other U.S. assets and $0.7 million related to foreign net operating loss adjustments.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P247_S5	These increases were partially offset by the utilization of $1.1 million of U.S. net operating losses and other U.S. assets and $0.8 million of non-U.S. net operating losses and other foreign assets.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P247_S6	Management believes it is more likely than not that future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets recorded net of these valuation allowances.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P248_S0	Based on $58.0 million repatriated in 2012, and an estimated $133.0 million to be repatriated in 2013 to the U.S., a $28.8 million tax benefit was recorded in 2012.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P248_S1	During 2013, we actually repatriated $196.2 million.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P248_S2	Additional tax benefit of $14.5 million was recorded in 2013.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P248_S3	We have not recorded a deferred tax liability for $1.1 billion of remaining undistributed earnings of subsidiaries located outside of the U.S.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P248_S4	Although tax liabilities might result from the payment of dividends out of such earnings, or as a result of a sale or liquidation of non-U.S. subsidiaries, these earnings are permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. and we do not have any plans to repatriate these earnings or to sell or liquidate any of these non-U.S. subsidiaries.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P248_S5	To the extent that we are able to repatriate the unremitted earnings in a tax efficient manner, or in the event of a change in our capital situation or investment strategy in which such funds become needed for funding our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds, net of foreign tax credits.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P249_S0	The determination of the tax liability upon repatriation is not practicable.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P249_S1	Cash and cash equivalents owned by non-U.S. subsidiaries totaled $325.0 million at December 31, 2013.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P249_S2	The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $95.7 million and $95.6 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P249_S3	The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect our effective tax rate, if recognized, is $50.8 million ($48.8 million, net of federal benefit received from state positions) and $51.5 million ($49.4 million, net of federal benefit received from state positions) as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P249_S4	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 is as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_14_ITEM8_P250_S0	We believe it is reasonably possible that between $58.2 million and $81.8 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits will be settled during the next twelve months due to filing amended returns and the conclusion of an advanced pricing agreement.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P250_S1	Our continuing practice is to recognize potential accrued interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters within income tax expense.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P250_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we accrued an additional $2.6 million, $3.3 million and $3.4 million, respectively, in interest associated with uncertain tax positions.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P250_S3	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we have recognized a liability for interest and penalties of $33.0 million ($25.9 million, net of related federal benefit received from interest expense) and $30.4 million ($24.1 million, net of related federal benefit received from interest expense), respectively.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P251_S0	We conduct business globally and, as a result, one or more of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and multiple state, local and foreign jurisdictions.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P251_S1	We are no longer subject to U.S. federal Internal Revenue Service audits for years prior to 2005.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P251_S2	With limited exception, our significant state and foreign tax jurisdictions are no longer subject to audit by the various tax authorities for tax years prior to 2007.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P252_S0	Our board of directors is authorized, subject to any limitations imposed by law, without the approval of our stockholders, to issue a total of 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, in one or more series, with each such series having rights and preferences including voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences, as our board of directors may determine.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P252_S1	Grant recipients under our various equity compensation plans may elect for us to repurchase shares awarded to them to satisfy minimum statutory federal, state and local tax withholding obligations arising from the vesting of their equity awards.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P252_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2013, 601,917 shares with an average price paid per share of $22.00 were repurchased relating thereto.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P253_S0	The following is a calculation of earnings per share (dollars in thousands, except share data):
1138118_14_ITEM8_P253_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, 72,580, 2,210,383 and 11,880, respectively, contingently issuable shares and options to purchase 51,426, 103,423 and 55,587 shares, respectively, of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P254_S0	The accompanying consolidated balance sheets do not include the net assets of escrow, agency and fiduciary funds, which are held by us on behalf of clients and which amounted to $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P255_S0	Discontinued Operations In the ordinary course of business, we dispose of real estate assets, or hold real estate assets for sale, that may be considered components of an entity in accordance with Topic 360.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P255_S1	If we do not have, or expect to have, significant continuing involvement with the operation of these real estate assets after disposition, we are required to recognize operating profits or losses and gains or losses on disposition of these assets as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations in the periods in which they occur.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P255_S2	Real estate operations and dispositions accounted for as discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were reported in our Global Investment Management and Development Services segments and totaled the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_14_ITEM8_P256_S0	Segments We report our operations through the following segments: (1) Americas, (2) EMEA, (3) Asia Pacific, (4) Global Investment Management and (5) Development Services.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P257_S0	The Americas segment is our largest segment of operations and provides a comprehensive range of services throughout the U.S. and in the largest regions of Canada and key markets in Latin America.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P257_S1	The primary services offered consist of the following: real estate services, mortgage loan origination and servicing, valuation services, asset services and occupier outsourcing.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P257_S2	Our EMEA and Asia Pacific segments provide services similar to the Americas business segment.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P257_S3	The EMEA segment has operations primarily in Europe, while the Asia Pacific segment has operations primarily in Asia, Australia and New Zealand.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P258_S0	Our Global Investment Management business provides investment management services to clients seeking to generate returns and diversification through direct and indirect investments in real estate in North America, Europe and Asia.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P258_S1	Our Development Services business consists of real estate development and investment activities primarily in the U.S. Summarized financial information by segment is as follows (dollars in thousands): EBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P258_S2	Our management believes EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P258_S3	Such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P259_S0	our management uses EBITDA as a measure to evaluate the operating performance of our various business segments and for other discretionary purposes, including as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive programs.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P259_S1	Additionally, we believe EBITDA is useful to investors to assist them in getting a more complete picture of our results from operations.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P259_S2	However, EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under GAAP and when analyzing our operating performance, readers should use EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P259_S3	Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P259_S4	Furthermore, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management s discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P259_S5	The amounts shown for EBITDA also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P260_S0	Net interest expense and write-off of financing costs have been expensed in the segment incurred.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P260_S1	Provision for (benefit of) income taxes has been allocated among our segments by using applicable U.S. and foreign effective tax rates.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P260_S2	EBITDA for our segments is calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_14_ITEM8_P261_S0	Identifiable assets by industry segment are those assets used in our operations in each segment.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P261_S1	Corporate identifiable assets include cash and cash equivalents available for general corporate use and net deferred tax assets.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P262_S0	The revenue shown in the table above is allocated based upon the country in which services are performed.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P262_S1	The long-lived assets shown in the table above are comprised of net property and equipment.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P262_S2	Related Party Transactions Included in prepaid expenses, other current assets and other long-term assets, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are loans to related parties, primarily employees other than our executive officers, of $98.2 million and $66.5 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P262_S3	The majority of these loans represent sign-on and retention bonuses issued or assumed in connection with acquisitions and prepaid commissions as well as prepaid retention and recruitment awards issued to employees.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P262_S4	These loans are at varying principal amounts, bear interest at rates up to 5.1% per annum and mature on various dates through 2023.

1138118_14_ITEM8_P263_S2	The principal elimination entries eliminate investments in consolidated subsidiaries and intercompany balances and transactions.
1138118_14_ITEM8_P264_S0	Although CBRE Capital Markets is included among our domestic subsidiaries that jointly and severally guarantee our 5.00% senior notes, 6.625% senior notes and our Credit Agreement, a substantial majority of warehouse receivables funded under BofA, TD Bank, JP Morgan, Capital One, the JP Morgan Master Repurchase Agreement and Fannie Mae ASAP lines of credit are pledged to BofA, TD Bank, JP Morgan, Capital One and Fannie Mae, and accordingly, are not included as collateral for these notes or our other outstanding debt.

1138118_14_ITEM8_P266_S0	(1) EPS is defined as earnings per share.
1138118_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Securities Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f), including maintenance of (i) records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets, and (ii) policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance that (a) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, (b) our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our Board of Directors and (c) we will prevent or timely detect unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1138118_14_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control.
1138118_14_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses of judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.
1138118_14_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper overriding of controls.
1138118_14_ITEM9A_P1_S3	As a result of such limitations, there is risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
1138118_14_ITEM9A_P1_S4	However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
1138118_14_ITEM9A_P1_S5	Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
1138118_14_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission.
1138118_14_ITEM9A_P2_S1	We acquired London-based Norland Managed Services Ltd during 2013 ( Acquired Business ) as defined in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, and we excluded from our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, the Acquired Business s internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets of $680.2 million included in our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2013.
1138118_14_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Based on our evaluation under the COSO framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2013.
1138118_14_ITEM9A_P2_S3	The effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.
1138118_14_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our policy for disclosure controls and procedures provides guidance on the evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures and is designed to ensure that all corporate disclosure is complete and accurate in all material respects and that all information required to be disclosed in the periodic reports submitted by us under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods and in the manner specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms.

1138118_14_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer in this evaluation.
1138118_14_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as required by the Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(c) as of the end of the period covered by this report.

1138118_14_ITEM15_P43_S0	CEO AWARDS The Company reserves the right to award to a Participant a supplemental discretionary bonus award in cases of exceptional and exceedingly deserving circumstances, the amount of which shall be determined in the Chief Executive Officer s sole discretion (subject to the ratification by the Board of Directors).
1138118_14_ITEM15_P43_S1	This supplemental award is referred to herein as a CEO Award .
1138118_14_ITEM15_P44_S0	9.1 Participants are eligible for an Award each Plan Year, based on (a) financial measures ( Financial Performance Targets ) for the Company, business unit or line of business, and (b) individual achievement of important Company or individual objectives in each Participant s area of responsibility ( Strategic Performance Measures ).
1138118_14_ITEM15_P45_S0	Each Participant will be assigned a Target Award by the Company in its sole discretion (generally based on a Participant s position and that position s potential contribution to the Company) by March 31 of each Plan Year.
1138118_14_ITEM15_P45_S1	For new hires or newly-eligible Participants (whether by transfer or promotion), the Target Award will be set within ninety (90) days of eligibility for the Plan.
1138118_14_ITEM15_P46_S0	(b) Target Awards will be determined based on Financial Performance Targets and Strategic Performance Measures established at or near the beginning of a Plan Year for each Participant (or for new hires or newly-eligible Participants (whether by transfer or promotion), established at or near the date of their eligibility to participate in the Plan).
1138118_14_ITEM15_P47_S0	At the Committee s direction, Strategic Performance Measures account for 20% to 40% (inclusive) of the Target Award (depending on the executive category) (the Strategic Performance Portion ), and the remainder is the Financial Performance Portion .
1138118_14_ITEM15_P47_S1	For example, if the Committee determines that an Award should be weighted 80% on financial measures and 20% on strategic measures, then that Participant s Financial Performance Portion would be 80%, and that Participant s Strategic Performance Portion would be 20%.
1138118_14_ITEM15_P48_S0	In the event that a Target Award amount or weighting of any component thereof is changed during a Plan Year, the payment of that Plan Year s Award will be pro-rated based on the number of full weeks that each respective Target Award (or such component s weighting) was in force, unless other written agreements supersede this provision.
1138118_14_ITEM15_P49_S0	9.3 Financial Performance Targets : Financial Performance Targets are approved by the Board of Directors at or near the beginning of each Plan Year.
1138118_14_ITEM15_P49_S1	Until otherwise designated by the Board of Directors, EBITDA is the metric utilized to set Financial Performance Targets for the Company, regions, business units and lines of business, as adjusted to eliminate the effects of charges for restructurings, discontinued operations, extraordinary items and other unusual or non-recurring items as well as the cumulative effect of tax or accounting changes.
1138118_14_ITEM15_P49_S2	The Company (with the approval of the Board of Directors) reserves the right to change the Financial Performance Target metric from time to time without the necessity of amending the Plan.
1138118_14_ITEM15_P50_S0	(a) Participants must have measurable Strategic Performance Measures set by the Company in writing by March 31 of each Plan Year in respect of that Plan Year, with the Company having the discretion (but not being required) to assign relative weights to each such Strategic Performance Measure.
1138118_14_ITEM15_P50_S1	If relative weights are not assigned, then each Strategic Performance Measure will be given an equal weighting.
1138118_14_ITEM15_P51_S0	(b) For new hires or newly-eligible Participants (whether by transfer or promotion), the Strategic Performance Measures must be set within ninety (90) days of eligibility for the Plan.
1138118_14_ITEM15_P52_S0	(c) Non-submission of Strategic Performance Measures to the Board of Directors will make the Participant ineligible for an Award.
1138118_14_ITEM15_P53_S0	Following the conclusion of the Plan Year, assuming the Discretionary Company Thresholds are satisfied, Awards are calculated as follows:
1138118_14_ITEM15_P54_S0	(a) Preliminary Award : Actual financial performance is compared to the Financial Performance Targets, and an Adjustment Factor is then determined as follows:
1138118_14_ITEM15_P55_S0	* The Adjustment Factor for financial performance achievement between 70% and 130% of the financial performance target will be linearly interpolated.
1138118_14_ITEM15_P55_S1	For example, achievement of 124.3% of the Financial Performance Target will result in an Adjustment Factor of 181.00%.
1138118_14_ITEM15_P55_S2	The Adjustment Factor is then multiplied by the dollar amount of the full Target Award.
1138118_14_ITEM15_P55_S3	This product is the Preliminary Award .
1138118_14_ITEM15_P56_S0	The Preliminary Award is then multiplied by the weighting of the Financial Performance Portion for the Participant.
1138118_14_ITEM15_P56_S1	This product becomes part of the Award for the Participant.
1138118_14_ITEM15_P57_S0	First , the Preliminary Award is multiplied by the weighting of the Strategic Performance Portion for the Participant to determine a base amount attributable to Strategic Performance Measures (the Strategic Base Amount ).
1138118_14_ITEM15_P57_S1	Second , following the end of the Plan Year, the Chief Executive Officer (or where the Participant is the Chief Executive Officer, the Committee) will score that Participant based on that Participant s performance against his or her Strategic Performance Measures, considered individually (and if so, by taking into account their relative weightings) or by giving a single score for all Strategic Performance Measures, as the Chief Executive Officer so determines.
1138118_14_ITEM15_P57_S2	The Participant s performance against the Strategic Performance Measures as so considered will be rated using a scorecard with a scale of 1 through 5 that has corresponding percentage grades 1 , and will take into account recommendations from the Participant s direct manager (as applicable).
1138118_14_ITEM15_P58_S0	1 The scorecard will be as follows:
1138118_14_ITEM15_P59_S0	* A composite score of 4.2 (e.g., because four strategic measures weighted at 20% each received a 4 but a fifth strategic measure also weighted at 20% received a 5 ) would be linearly interpolated to result in a 130.0% preliminary multiplier.
1138118_14_ITEM15_P60_S0	contain space for commentary regarding the Participant s performance if appropriate ( e.g ., describing special circumstances).
1138118_14_ITEM15_P60_S1	The information on the scorecard, taken as a whole, is then used to determine a preliminary multiplier against the Strategic Base Amount, which preliminary multiplier will range from zero to a maximum of 150%.
1138118_14_ITEM15_P60_S2	Third, once the preliminary multiplier is so determined, the Chief Executive Officer (or where the Participant is the Chief Executive Officer, the Committee) may (but is not required to) then further adjust such preliminary multiplier (but not to be less than zero or more than 150%) after taking into account, among other things, the Participant s performance and positioning relative to his or her peer group, seniority, experience, growth, development and accomplishments in respect of and outside the Strategic Performance Measures (including, if relevant, in respect of other objectives that became important Company or Participant priorities during the year).
1138118_14_ITEM15_P60_S3	The preliminary multiplier, as so further adjusted, then becomes the ultimate multiplier, and the product of this ultimate multiplier and the Strategic Base Amount becomes part of the Award for the Participant.
1138118_14_ITEM15_P61_S0	(d) Sum of Resultant Products; Subject to Overall Cap : The resultant parts in the ultimate sentences of Sections 9.5(b) and 9.5(c) are then added together to arrive at an Award for the Participant (but subject to the other terms contained in the Plan, including Section 9.5(e)), not to exceed the overall cap in Section 7 hereof.
1138118_14_ITEM15_P62_S0	(e) Role of CEO and Board of Directors .
1138118_14_ITEM15_P62_S1	The final Award recommendation will be made by the Chief Executive Officer and approved by the Board of Directors.
1138118_14_ITEM15_P63_S0	(f) Subject to Discretionary Company Thresholds .
1138118_14_ITEM15_P63_S1	Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Discretionary Company Thresholds in Section 5 are not met, no Award (or portion thereof) will be earned or paid under the Plan.

1138118_14_ITEM15_P65_S0	The Plan does not constitute a contract of employment (express or implied) and cannot be relied upon as such.

1138118_14_ITEM15_P98_S0	The foregoing certification is being furnished solely pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 1350 and is not being filed as part of the Report or as a separate disclosure document.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P0_S0	CBRE Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, (which may be referred to in this Form 10-K as the company , we , us and our ), is the world s largest commercial real estate services and investment firm, based on 2014 revenue, with leading full-service operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P0_S1	We offer a full range of services to occupiers, owners, lenders and investors in office, retail, industrial, multifamily and other types of commercial real estate.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P0_S2	As of December 31, 2014, excluding independent affiliates, we operated in over 370 offices worldwide, with more than 52,000 employees providing commercial real estate services under the CBRE brand name, investment management services under the CBRE Global Investors brand name and development services under the Trammell Crow brand name.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P0_S3	Our business is focused on several competencies, including commercial property and corporate facilities management, tenant/occupier and property/agency leasing, capital markets solutions (property sales, commercial mortgage origination and servicing, and debt/structured finance), real estate investment management, valuation, development services and proprietary research.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P0_S4	We generate revenues from management fees on a contractual and per-project basis, and from commissions on transactions.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P0_S5	Our contractual, fee-for-services businesses, which generally involve property and facilities management, mortgage loan servicing and investment management, represented approximately 46% of our 2014 revenue.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P0_S6	In addition, our appraisal/valuation and leasing services have contractual elements and work for clients in these service lines is often recurring in nature.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P0_S7	Our revenue mix has shifted in recent years toward more contractual revenue as property occupiers and investors increasingly prefer to purchase integrated, account-based services from firms that have the capabilities to meet their needs across diverse disciplines and in local markets nationally and globally.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P0_S8	We believe we are well-positioned to capture a growing share of the business being awarded as a result of this trend.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P0_S9	In 2014, we generated revenue from a well-balanced, highly diversified base of clients, including approximately 85 of the Fortune 100 companies.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P0_S10	In 2014, we were the highest ranked commercial real estate services company among the Fortune Most Admired Companies, and we ranked seventh among all companies on the Barron s 500, which evaluates companies on growth and financial performance.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P0_S11	We have been the only commercial real estate services and investment firm included in the S P 500 since 2006, and in the Fortune 500 since 2008.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P0_S12	Additionally, the International Association of Outsourcing Professionals (IAOP) has included us among the top 100 global outsourcing companies across all industries for nine consecutive years.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P0_S13	In 2014, the IAOP ranked us as a top three service provider among all outsourcing companies globally and as the highest ranked commercial real estate services company for the fifth year in a row.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P1_S0	CBRE History CBRE marked its 108 th year of continuous operations in 2014, tracing our origins to a company founded in San Francisco in the aftermath of the 1906 earthquake.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P1_S1	Since then, we have grown into the largest global commercial real estate services and investment firm (in terms of 2014 revenue) through organic growth and a series of strategic acquisitions, including the December 2006 purchase of Trammell Crow Company and the 2011 acquisition of substantially all of ING Group N.V. s Real Estate Investment Management (REIM) operations in Europe and Asia and its U.S.-based global real estate listed securities business (collectively referred to as the REIM Acquisitions).
1138118_15_ITEM1_P1_S2	In 2013, we fortified our real estate outsourcing platform in Europe with the acquisition of London-based Norland Managed Services Ltd (Norland).
1138118_15_ITEM1_P1_S3	Norland is a premier provider of building technical engineering services that enables us to self-perform these services in Europe and adds to our expertise in the highly specialized critical environments market.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	with which we had previous affiliate relationships.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P2_S1	These in-fill acquisitions are an integral part of our growth strategy and we completed 11 such acquisitions during 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	Our Regions of Operation and Principal Services CBRE Group, Inc. is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its indirect subsidiaries.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P3_S1	CBRE Services, Inc., our direct wholly-owned subsidiary, is also generally a holding company and is the primary obligor or issuer with respect to most of our long-term indebtedness.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P3_S2	We report our operations through the following segments: (1) Americas, (2) Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, (3) Asia Pacific, (4) Global Investment Management and (5) Development Services.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P3_S3	Information regarding revenue and operating income or loss, attributable to each of our segments, is included in Segment Operations within the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section and within Note 20 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by reference.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P3_S4	Information concerning the identifiable assets of each of our business segments is also set forth in Note 20 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	The Americas The Americas is our largest reporting segment, comprised of operations throughout the United States and Canada as well as key markets in Latin America.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P4_S1	Our operations are largely wholly-owned, but also include independent affiliates to whom we license the CBRE and CB Richard Ellis names in their local markets in return for payments of annual or quarterly royalty fees to us and an agreement to cross-refer business between us and the affiliate.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P4_S2	Most of our operations are conducted through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE, Inc.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P4_S3	Our mortgage loan origination, sales and servicing operations are conducted exclusively through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary operating under the name CBRE Capital Markets, Inc., or Capital Markets, and its subsidiaries.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P4_S4	Our operations in Canada are conducted through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE Limited.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P4_S5	Both CBRE Capital Markets and CBRE Limited are subsidiaries of CBRE, Inc.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our Americas segment accounted for 57.5% of our 2014 revenue, 62.7% of our 2013 revenue and 63.0% of our 2012 revenue.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	Our advisory services businesses offer occupier/tenant and investor/owner services that meet the full spectrum of marketplace needs, including (1) real estate services, (2) capital markets and (3) valuation.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P6_S1	Our advisory services business line accounted for 32.5% of our 2014 consolidated worldwide revenue, 34.8% of our 2013 consolidated worldwide revenue and 35.0% of our 2012 consolidated worldwide revenue.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P6_S2	Within advisory services, our major service lines are the following:
1138118_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	We provide strategic advice and execution to owners, investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with leasing, disposition and acquisition of property.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P7_S1	Our many years of strong local market presence have allowed us to develop significant repeat business from existing clients, including approximately 67% of our revenues from existing U.S. real estate sales and leasing clients in 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P7_S2	This includes referrals from other parts of our business.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P7_S3	Our real estate services professionals are particularly adept at aligning real estate strategies with client business objectives, serving as advisors as well as transaction executors.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	real estate services in most top U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau), including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix and San Francisco.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	Our real estate services professionals are compensated primarily through commission-based programs, which are payable upon completion of an assignment.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P9_S1	Therefore, as compensation is our largest expense, this cost structure gives us flexibility to mitigate the negative effect on our operating margins during difficult market conditions.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	Due to the low barriers to entry and significant competition for quality employees, we strive to retain top professionals through an attractive compensation program tied to productivity.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P10_S1	We believe we invest in greater support resources than most other firms, including professional development and training, market research and information, technology, branding and marketing.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P10_S2	We also foster an entrepreneurial culture that emphasizes client service and rewards performance.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P10_S3	We further strengthen our relationships with our real estate services clients by offering proprietary research to them through CBRE Research and CBRE Econometric Advisors, or CBRE-EA, our commercial real estate market information and forecasting groups.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	We offer clients fully integrated investment sales and debt/structured financing services under the CBRE Capital Markets brand.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P11_S1	The tight integration of these services fosters collaboration between our investment sales and debt/structured financing professionals, helping to meet the marketplace demand for comprehensive capital markets solutions.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P11_S2	During 2014, we concluded approximately $105.5 billion of capital markets transactions in the Americas, including $72.1 billion of investment sales transactions and $33.4 billion of mortgage loan originations and sales.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P11_S3	We believe our Investment Properties business, which includes office, industrial, retail, multifamily and hotel properties, is the leading investment sales property advisor in the United States, with a market share of approximately 16% in 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	Our mortgage brokerage business originates, sells and services commercial mortgage loans primarily through relationships established with investment banking firms, national banks, credit companies, insurance companies, pension funds and government agencies.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P12_S1	In the United States, our mortgage loan origination volume in 2014 was $26.7 billion, representing an increase of approximately 15% from 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P12_S2	Approximately $8.7 billion of loans in 2014 were originated for U.S. federal government-sponsored entities, most of which were financed through our revolving credit lines dedicated exclusively for this purpose.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P12_S3	We substantially mitigate the principal risk associated with loans financed through these credit lines prior to closing by either obtaining a contractual purchase commitment from the government-sponsored entity or confirming a forward-trade commitment for the issuance and purchase of a mortgage-backed security that will be secured by the loan.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P12_S4	We advised on the sale of approximately $5.8 billion of mortgages on behalf of financial institutions in 2014, compared with $2.5 billion in 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P12_S5	In 2014, GEMSA Loan Services, a joint venture between CBRE Capital Markets and GE Capital Real Estate, serviced approximately $118.1 billion of mortgage loans, $85.2 billion of which related to the servicing rights of CBRE Capital Markets.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	We provide valuation services that include market value appraisals, litigation support, discounted cash flow analyses, feasibility and fairness opinions and property condition and environmental consulting.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P13_S1	Our valuation business has developed proprietary systems for data management, analysis and valuation report preparation, which we believe provides us with an advantage over our competitors.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P13_S2	We believe that our valuation business is one of the largest in the industry.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P13_S3	During 2014, we completed over 48,000 valuation, appraisal and advisory assignments in the Americas.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	Two of our service offerings seek to capitalize on the outsourcing trend: (1) occupier outsourcing, which we provide through our Global Corporate Services business line, and (2) property management, which we provide through our Asset Services business line.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P14_S1	Agreements with our outsourcing clients that are occupiers of space are typically long-term arrangements with penalties for early termination.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P14_S2	Our management agreements with our property management clients, which are owners/investors in real estate, may be terminated by either party with notice generally ranging between 30 to 90 days; however, we have developed long-term relationships with many of these clients and we work closely with them to implement their specific goals and objectives and to preserve and expand upon these relationships.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P14_S3	As of December 31, 2014, we managed approximately 1.8 billion square feet of commercial space for property owners and occupiers in the Americas, which we believe represents one of the largest portfolios in the region.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P14_S4	Our outsourcing services business line accounted for 25.0% of our 2014 consolidated worldwide revenue, 27.9% of our 2013 consolidated worldwide revenue and 28.0% of our 2012 consolidated worldwide revenue.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	Through our Global Corporate Services business line, we provide a comprehensive suite of services to occupiers of real estate, including portfolio and transaction management, project management, facilities management and strategic consulting.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P15_S1	We are capitalizing significantly from the increasing preference of occupiers to purchase these services on an integrated, bundled basis, relying on one firm to meet their needs across geographic markets and service disciplines.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P15_S2	We enter into multi-year, multi-service outsourcing contracts with our clients, but also provide services on a one-off assignment or a short-term contract basis.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P15_S3	The long-term, contractual nature of these relationships enables us to devise and execute real estate strategies that support our clients overall business strategies.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P15_S4	Our clients include leading global corporations, health care providers and public sector entities with large, geographically-diverse real estate portfolios.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	Facilities management involves the day-to-day management of client-occupied space and includes headquarter buildings, regional offices, administrative offices, data centers and other critical facilities, and manufacturing and distribution facilities.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P16_S1	We identify best practices, implement technology solutions and leverage our resources to control clients facilities costs and enhance the workplace environment.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	Contracts for facilities management services are typically structured so we receive reimbursement of client-dedicated personnel costs and associated overhead expenses plus a monthly fee, and in some cases, annual incentives if agreed-upon performance targets are satisfied.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	Project management services are typically provided on a portfolio-wide or programmatic basis.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P18_S1	Revenues for project management generally include fixed management fees, variable fees, and incentive fees if certain agreed-upon performance targets are met.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P18_S2	Revenues for project management may also include reimbursement of payroll and related costs for personnel providing the services.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P18_S3	In general, portfolio and transaction services contribute revenue on a transaction basis; project management and facilities management contribute contractual, or per-project, revenue and strategic consulting services contribute both transaction and contractual revenue.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	Through our Asset Services business line, we provide property management services on a contractual basis for owners/investors in office, industrial and retail properties.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P19_S1	These services include construction management, marketing, leasing, building engineering, accounting and financial services.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P19_S2	We provide these services through an extensive network of real estate experts in major markets throughout the United States.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P19_S3	These local specialists are supported by a strategic accounts team whose function is to help ensure quality service and to maintain and expand relationships with large institutional clients, including buyers, sellers and landlords who need to lease, buy, sell and/or finance space.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P19_S4	We believe our contractual relationships with these clients put us in an advantageous position to provide other services to them, including refinancing, disposition and appraisal.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	We typically receive monthly management fees for the asset services we provide based upon a specified percentage of the monthly rental income or rental receipts generated from the property under management, or in certain cases, the greater of such percentage fee or a minimum agreed-upon fee.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P20_S1	We are also normally reimbursed for our administrative and payroll costs, as well as certain out-of-pocket expenses, directly attributable to the properties under management.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) Our Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, reporting segment operates in 41 countries with services primarily furnished through a number of indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P21_S1	The largest operations are located in France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P21_S2	Our operations in these countries generally provide a full range of services to the commercial property sector.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P21_S3	Additionally, we provide some residential property services, focused on the prime and super-prime segments of the market, primarily in the United Kingdom.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P21_S4	Within EMEA, our services are organized along similar lines as in the Americas, including leasing brokerage, property sales, valuation services, asset management services and facilities management, among others.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P21_S5	In addition, the acquisition of Norland in December 2013 enables us to self-perform building technical engineering services in Europe.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P21_S6	Our EMEA segment accounted for 25.9% of our 2014 revenue, 16.9% of our 2013 revenue and 15.8% of our 2012 revenue.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	In France, we believe we are a market leader in Paris and also have operations in Aix en Provence, Bagnolet, Bordeaux, Lille, Lyon, Marseille, Montreuil, Montrouge, Saint Denis and Toulouse.

1138118_15_ITEM1_P27_S2	In some strategies, CBRE Global Investors and its investment teams co-invest with its limited partners.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P27_S3	Our Global Investment Management segment accounted for 5.2% of our 2014 revenue, 7.5% of our 2013 revenue and 7.4% of our 2012 revenue.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	CBRE Global Investors offerings are organized into four primary categories, which include direct real estate investments through separate accounts and sponsored funds as well as indirect real estate investments through listed securities and multi manager investment programs.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P28_S1	These offerings cover the full range of risk strategies from core/core+ to opportunistic.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P28_S2	Operationally, dedicated investment teams execute each investment program within these categories, with the team s compensation being driven largely by the investment performance of its particular strategy/fund.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	This organizational structure is designed to align the interests of team members with those of the firm and its investor clients/partners and to enhance accountability and performance.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P29_S1	Dedicated teams are supported by shared resources such as accounting, finance, legal, information technology, investor services and research.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	CBRE Global Investors has an in-house team of research professionals who focus on investment strategy, underwriting and forecasting, based in part on market data from our advisory services group.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P30_S1	CBRE Global Investors closed approximately $6.8 billion and $4.2 billion of new acquisitions in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P30_S2	It liquidated $6.7 billion and $8.9 billion of investments in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P30_S3	Assets under management have increased from $15.1 billion at December 31, 2004 to $90.6 billion at December 31, 2014, representing an approximately 20% compound annual growth rate.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P30_S4	This includes growth as a result of the REIM Acquisitions.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	Previously, CBRE Global Investors has had a portfolio of consolidated real estate held for investment consisting of multifamily/residential properties located in the United States.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P31_S1	Included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were rental revenues (which are included in revenue) and expenses (which are included in operating, administrative and other expenses) relating to operational real estate properties, excluding those reported as discontinued operations in 2013 and 2012, of $3.6 million and $2.6 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014, $9.8 million and $5.3 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $20.2 million and $18.4 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	Development Services Operations in our Development Services reporting segment are conducted through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Trammell Crow Company, LLC and certain of its subsidiaries, providing development services primarily in the United States to users of and investors in commercial real estate, as well as for its own account.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P32_S1	Trammell Crow Company pursues opportunistic, risk-mitigated development and investment in commercial real estate across a wide spectrum of property types, including: industrial, office and retail properties; healthcare facilities of all types (medical office buildings, hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers); and residential/mixed-use projects.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P32_S2	Our Development Services segment accounted for 0.7% of our 2014 revenue, 0.7% of our 2013 revenue and 1.2% of our 2012 revenue.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	Trammell Crow Company acts as the manager of development projects, providing services that are vital in all stages of the process, including: (i) site identification, due diligence and acquisition; (ii) evaluating project feasibility, budgeting, scheduling and cash flow analysis; (iii) procurement of approvals and permits, including zoning and other entitlements; (iv) project finance advisory services; (v) coordination of project design and engineering; (vi) construction bidding and management as well as tenant finish coordination; and (vii) project close-out and tenant move coordination.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	Development activity in which Trammell Crow Company has an ownership interest is conducted through subsidiaries that are consolidated or unconsolidated for financial reporting purposes, depending primarily on the extent and nature of our ownership interest.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P34_S1	As of December 31, 2014, our portfolio of consolidated real estate consisted of land, industrial and office properties that are geographically dispersed throughout the United States.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P34_S2	Included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were rental revenues (which are included in revenue) and expenses (which are included in operating, administrative and other expenses) relating to these operational real estate properties, excluding those reported as discontinued operations in 2013 and 2012, of $10.7 million and $4.2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014, $14.5 million and $6.4 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $35.4 million and $17.1 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	At December 31, 2014, Trammell Crow Company had $5.4 billion of development projects in process.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P35_S1	Additionally, the inventory of pipeline deals (prospective projects we believe have a greater than 50% chance of closing or where land has been acquired and the projected construction start date is more than twelve months out) was $4.0 billion at December 31, 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	Competition We compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate industry, including commercial property and corporate facilities management, occupier and property/agency leasing, property sales, valuation, real estate investment management, commercial mortgage origination and servicing, capital markets (structured finance and debt) solutions, development services and proprietary research.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P36_S1	Each business discipline is highly competitive on an international, national, regional and local level.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P36_S2	Although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2014 revenue, our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographic markets, property types and services.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P36_S3	Depending on the geography, property type or service, we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers that compete with us on a global, national, regional or local basis or within a market segment; outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have recently expanded their offerings; in-house corporate real estate departments and property owners/developers that self-perform real estate services; investment banking firms, investment managers and developers that compete with us to raise and place investment capital; and accounting/consulting firms that advise on real estate strategies.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P36_S4	Some of these firms may have greater financial resources than we do.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	Despite recent consolidation, the commercial real estate services industry remains highly fragmented and competitive.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P37_S1	Although many of our competitors are substantially smaller than us, some of them are larger on a local or regional basis or have a stronger position in a market segment or service offering.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P37_S2	In addition, it is also possible that two or more of our competitors could combine to create a much larger and more formidable global competitor.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P37_S3	Among our primary competitors are other large national and global firms, such as Cushman Wakefield, JLL (also known as Jones Lang LaSalle), FirstService Corporation (the publicly traded parent of Colliers International), Savills (which acquired U.S.-based service provider Studley, Inc. in 2014) and DTZ (which was acquired in 2014 by an investment consortium led by TPG Capital and merged with Cassidy Turley, a U.S.-based real-estate services firm, forming a new competitor entity), and Newmark Grubb Knight Frank; market-segment specialists, such as HFF and Eastdil Secured; and large global firms with business lines that compete with our outsourcing business.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	Seasonality A significant portion of our revenue is seasonal, which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P39_S0	Historically, our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flow from operating activities tend to be lowest in the first quarter, and highest in the fourth quarter of each year.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P39_S1	Earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth quarter due to the focus on completing sales, financing and leasing transactions prior to calendar year-end.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P40_S0	Employees At December 31, 2014, excluding our independent affiliates, we had more than 52,000 employees worldwide, approximately 43% of which represent costs that are fully reimbursed by clients and are mostly in our outsourcing services lines of business.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P40_S1	At December 31, 2014, 1,222 of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements, most of whom are on-site employees in our asset services business in California, Illinois, New Jersey and New York.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	We hold various trademarks and trade names worldwide, which include the CBRE name as well as our prior CB Richard Ellis name.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P41_S1	Although we believe our intellectual property plays a role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve, we do not believe we would be materially, adversely affected by expiration or termination of our trademarks or trade names or the loss of any of our other intellectual property rights other than the CBRE, CB Richard Ellis and Trammell Crow names.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	With respect to the CBRE and CB Richard Ellis names, we maintain trademark registrations for these service marks in jurisdictions where we conduct significant business.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P42_S1	We hold a license to use the Trammell Crow trade name pursuant to a license agreement with CF98, L.P., an affiliate of Crow Realty Investors, L.P., d/b/a Crow Holdings, which may be revoked if we fail to satisfy usage and quality control covenants under the license agreement.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	In addition to trade names, we have developed proprietary technologies for the provision of complex services and analysis through our global outsourcing business and for preparing and developing valuation reports for our clients through our valuation business.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P43_S1	We also offer proprietary research to clients through our CBRE-EA research unit and we offer proprietary investment analysis and structures through CBRE Global Investors.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	We have not generally registered these items of intellectual property in any jurisdiction.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P44_S1	While we may seek to secure our rights under applicable intellectual property protection laws in these and any other proprietary assets that we use in our business, we do not believe any of these other items of intellectual property are material to our business in the aggregate.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P45_S0	Environmental Matters Federal, state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business impose environmental liabilities, controls, disclosure rules and zoning restrictions that affect the ownership, management, development, use or sale of commercial real estate.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P45_S1	Certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability on current or previous real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating, cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property, including contamination resulting from above-ground or underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos or lead at a property.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P45_S2	If contamination occurs or is present during our role as a property or facility manager or developer, we could be held liable for such costs as a current operator of a property, regardless of the legality of the acts or omissions that caused the contamination and without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P45_S3	The operator of a site also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from exposure to hazardous substances or environmental contamination at a site, including liabilities arising from exposure to asbestos-containing materials.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	Under certain laws and common law principles, any failure by us to disclose environmental contamination at a property could subject us to liability to a buyer or lessee of the property.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P46_S1	Further, federal, state and local governments in the countries in which we do business have enacted various laws, regulations, and treaties governing environmental and climate change, particularly for greenhouse gases, which seek to tax, penalize or limit their release.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P46_S2	Such regulations could lead to increased operational or compliance costs over time.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	While we are aware of the presence or the potential presence of regulated substances in the soil or groundwater at or near several properties owned, operated or managed by us that may have resulted from historical or ongoing activities on those properties, we are not aware of any material noncompliance with the environmental laws or regulations currently applicable to us, and we are not the subject of any material claim for liability with respect to contamination at any location.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P47_S1	However, these laws and regulations may discourage sales and leasing activities and mortgage lending with respect to some properties, which may adversely affect both the commercial real estate services industry and us in general.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P47_S2	Environmental contamination or other environmental liabilities may also negatively affect the value of commercial real estate assets held by entities that are managed by our investment management and development services businesses, which could adversely affect the results of operations of these business lines.

1138118_15_ITEM1_P49_S3	Information contained on our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or our other filings with the SEC.
1138118_15_ITEM1_P49_S4	We assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless we are required to do so by law.

1138118_15_ITEM1_P49_S6	The SEC also maintains an Internet site ( www.sec.gov ) that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	documents we file with the SEC are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report and other public statements we make.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Based on the information currently known to us, we believe that the matters discussed below identify the material risk factors affecting our business.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P0_S2	However, the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial (but that later become material) may also adversely affect our business.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P0_S4	The success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and, accordingly, our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by economic slowdowns, liquidity crises, fiscal uncertainty and possible subsequent downturns in commercial real estate asset values, property sales and leasing activities in one or more of the geographies or industry sectors that we or our clients serve.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	asset prices, liquidity problems and limited availability of credit, made worse in certain areas by increased unemployment or limited economic growth.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	It is uncertain how long these effects will last, or whether economic and financial trends in those areas, particularly in Europe, will worsen or improve.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The current economic situation may be exacerbated if additional negative geo-political or economic developments, natural disasters or other disruptions were to arise.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Periods of economic weakness or recession, significantly rising interest rates, fiscal uncertainty, declining employment levels, declining demand for commercial real estate, falling real estate values, disruption to the global capital or credit markets or the public perception that any of these events may occur, may negatively affect the performance of some or all of our business lines.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Our business is significantly affected by generally prevailing economic conditions in the principal markets where we operate, which can result in a general decline in real estate acquisition, disposition and leasing activity, as well as a general decline in the value of commercial real estate and in rents, which in turn reduces revenue from property management fees and commissions derived from property sales, leasing, valuation and financing, as well as revenues associated with development or investment management activities.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Our Capital Markets business could also suffer from any political or economic disruption that affects interest rates or liquidity.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P2_S4	In addition, we could experience a reduction in the amount of fees we earn in our Global Investment Management business if our assets under management decrease or those assets fail to perform as anticipated.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P2_S5	These economic conditions could also lead to a decline in property sales prices as well as a decline in funds invested in existing commercial real estate assets and properties planned for development.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our development and investment strategy often entails making relatively modest co-investments alongside our investor clients.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our ability to conduct these activities depends in part on the supply of investment capital for commercial real estate and related assets.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P3_S2	During an economic downturn, investment capital is usually constrained and it may take longer for us to dispose of real estate investments or selling prices may be lower than originally anticipated.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P3_S3	As a result, the value of our commercial real estate investments may be reduced, and we could realize losses or diminished profitability.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P3_S4	In addition, economic downturns may reduce the amount of loan originations and related servicing by our commercial mortgage brokerage business.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Performance of our asset services line of business partially depends upon the performance of the properties we manage because our fees are generally based on a percentage of aggregate rent collections from these properties.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The performance of these properties may be affected by many factors which are partially or completely outside of our control, including: (i) real estate and financial market conditions prevailing generally and locally; (ii) our ability to attract and retain creditworthy tenants, particularly during economic downturns; and (iii) the magnitude of defaults by tenants under their respective leases, which may increase during distressed conditions.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	For example, during 2008 and 2009, credit became severely constrained and prohibitively expensive, and real estate market activity contracted sharply in most markets around the world as a result of the global financial crisis and the deep economic recession.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P4_S3	These adverse macro conditions affected commercial real estate services companies like ours by significantly hampering transaction activity and lowering real estate valuations.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Similar to other commercial real estate services firms, our transaction volumes fell during 2008 and most of 2009, and as a result, our stock price declined significantly.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P4_S5	If the economic and market conditions that prevailed in 2008 and 2009 were to return, our business performance and profitability could again deteriorate.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P4_S6	Certain geographies within the Americas, as well as certain sectors of the constituency that we serve, have been negatively affected by the recent weakened performance of the U.S. oil and gas industry, which may in turn diminish the performance of our various development, investment, leasing and other businesses in those geographies as well as reduce the demand for our services by our clients in such areas or who are affected by that industry.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P4_S7	In addition, the economic situation in Europe remains unstable, arising from the various austerity policies and continuing credit restrictions.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P4_S8	If the nascent recovery in certain European economies does not gain traction, or if conditions remain unstable or worsen, our revenues may be adversely affected.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Economic uncertainty as well as significant changes and volatility in the financial markets and business environment, and in the global political, security and competitive landscape, make it increasingly difficult for us to predict our revenue and earnings into the future.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	As a result, any revenue or earnings guidance or outlook, which we have given or might give, may be overtaken by events, or may otherwise turn out to be inaccurate.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Though we endeavor to give reasonable estimates of future revenue and earnings at the time we give such guidance based on then-current conditions, there is a significant risk that such guidance or outlook will turn out to be, or to have been, incorrect.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Adverse developments in the credit markets may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our Global Investment Management, Development Services and Capital Markets (including investment property sales and debt and structured financing services) businesses are sensitive to credit cost and availability as well as marketplace liquidity.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Additionally, the revenues in all of our businesses are dependent to some extent on the overall volume of activity (and pricing) in the commercial real estate market.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business of providing advisory services to owners, investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with the leasing, disposition and acquisition of property.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	If our clients are unable to procure credit on favorable terms, there may be fewer completed leasing transactions, dispositions and acquisitions of property.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In addition, if purchasers of commercial real estate are not able to procure favorable financing resulting in the lack of disposition opportunities for our funds and projects, our Global Investment Management and Development Services businesses will be unable to generate incentive fees, and we may also experience losses of co-invested equity capital if the disruption causes a permanent decline in the value of investments made.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our international operations subject us to social, political and economic risks of doing business in foreign countries.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the United States and as a result, we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	During 2014, we generated approximately 44% of our revenue from operations outside the United States.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P8_S3	With the REIM Acquisitions, the footprint of our Global Investment Management business significantly expanded, particularly in Europe and Asia, and with the acquisition of Norland, our Global Corporate Services business has expanded significantly in Europe.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Additional circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations include, but are not limited to, the following factors:
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in countries such as China and Thailand.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We maintain anti-corruption and anti-money laundering compliance programs and programs designed to enable us to comply with applicable government economic sanctions, embargoes and other import/export controls throughout the company.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P9_S2	But, coordinating our activities to deal with the broad range of complex legal and regulatory environments in which we operate presents significant challenges.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P9_S3	We may not be successful in complying with regulations in all situations and violations may result in criminal or civil sanctions, including material monetary fines, penalties, equitable remedies (including disgorgement), and other costs against us or our employees, and may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P9_S4	We have committed additional resources to expand our worldwide sales and marketing activities, to globalize our service offerings and products in selected markets and to develop local sales and support channels.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P9_S5	If we are unable to successfully implement these plans, maintain adequate long-term strategies that successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P9_S6	In addition, we have penetrated, and seek to continue to enter into, emerging markets to further expand our global platform.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P9_S7	However, we may not be successful in effectively evaluating and monitoring the key business, operational, legal and compliance risks specific to those markets.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P9_S8	The political and cultural risks present in emerging countries could also harm our ability to successfully execute our operations or manage our businesses there.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P9_S9	Our revenue and earnings may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P9_S10	Our revenue from non-U.S. operations is denominated primarily in the local currency where the associated revenue was earned.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P9_S11	During 2014, approximately 44% of our revenue was transacted in foreign currencies, the majority of which included the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Euro, Indian rupee, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our Global Investment Management business has a significant amount of Euro-denominated assets under management as well as associated revenue and earnings in Europe, which continues to experience economic stagnation that may result in further deterioration in the value of the Euro against the U.S. dollar.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may result in corresponding fluctuations in our assets under management, revenue and earnings.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Over time, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P10_S4	In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Selectively, our management uses currency hedging instruments, including foreign currency forward and option contracts.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P10_S6	There can be no assurance that these hedging instruments will be available when needed.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P10_S7	Additionally, economic risks associated with these hedging instruments include unexpected fluctuations in inflation rates, which affect cash flow, unexpected changes in the underlying net asset position, and hedge counterparty credit risk.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our growth has benefited significantly from acquisitions, which may not perform as expected and similar opportunities may not be available in the future.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	A significant component of our growth has occurred through acquisitions, including our acquisition of Norland in 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions, which may not be available to us, as well as sufficient liquidity and credit to fund these acquisitions.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We may incur significant additional debt from time to time to finance any such acquisitions, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our then-existing indebtedness.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P12_S2	If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our then-existing debt, would increase.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Acquisitions involve risks that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired may prove incorrect.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Future acquisitions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transaction-related expenses, which include severance, lease termination, transaction and deferred financing costs, among others.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We have had, and may continue to experience, challenges in integrating operations and information technology systems acquired from other companies.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	This could result in the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of our key employees or clients or those of the acquired operations.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P14_S2	The integration process itself may be disruptive to our business and the acquired company s businesses as it requires coordination of geographically diverse organizations and implementation of new accounting and information technology systems.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We believe that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on operating and net income.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Acquisitions also frequently involve significant costs related to integrating information technology, accounting and management services and rationalizing personnel levels.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	The anticipated benefits of the Norland acquisition and other acquisitions we make may not be realized as we contemplated.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P15_S3	We completed the Norland acquisition as well as other acquisitions with the expectation that such acquisitions would result in various benefits, including, among others, enhanced revenues, a strengthened market position, cross-selling opportunities and operating efficiencies.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P15_S4	We are also likely to have similar expectations for future acquisitions.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Achieving the anticipated benefits of the Norland acquisition and other acquisitions will be subject to a number of uncertainties, including the realization of accretive benefits in the timeframe anticipated.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management s time and energy, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P15_S7	Our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees (including those acquired through acquisitions).
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P15_S8	Our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees, including Robert E. Sulentic, our President and Chief Executive Officer.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P15_S9	Mr. Sulentic and certain other key employees are not parties to employment agreements with us.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P15_S10	We also are highly dependent upon the retention of our property sales and leasing professionals, who generate a significant amount of our revenues, as well as other revenue producing professionals.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P15_S11	The departure of any of our key employees (including those acquired through acquisitions), or the loss of a significant number of key revenue producers, if we are unable to quickly hire and integrate qualified replacements, could cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to suffer.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P15_S12	Competition for these personnel is significant and we may not be able to successfully recruit, integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P15_S13	In addition, the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified support personnel in all areas of our business.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P15_S14	We use equity incentives to help retain and incentivize many of our key personnel.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P15_S15	Any significant decline in, or failure to grow, our stock price may result in an increased risk of loss of these key personnel.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P15_S16	If we are unable to attract and retain these qualified personnel, our growth may be limited and our business and operating results could suffer.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P15_S17	Our joint venture activities and affiliate program involve unique risks that are often outside of our control and that, if realized, could harm our business.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P15_S18	We have utilized joint ventures for commercial investment, select local brokerage and other affiliations both in the United States and internationally, and we may acquire interests in other joint ventures in the future.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	our affiliate program, we enter into contractual relationships with local brokerage, property management or other operations pursuant to which we license to that operation our name and make available certain of our resources, in exchange for a royalty or economic participation in that operation s revenue, profits or transactional activity.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	In many of these joint ventures and affiliations, we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures or affiliates, and other participants or operators of affiliates may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P16_S2	In addition, the other participants and operators may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P16_S3	If a joint venture participant or affiliate acts contrary to our interest, it could harm our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Our revenue, net income and cash flow generated by our Global Investment Management business can vary significantly as a result of market developments.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P16_S5	The revenue, net income and cash flow generated by our Global Investment Management business can be variable, primarily due to the fact that management, transaction and incentive fees can vary as a result of market movements from one period to another.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P16_S6	The pace at which the real estate markets worldwide turned from positive to negative starting in 2007 and continuing into 2009 is an example of the market volatility to which we are subject and over which we have no control.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The underlying market conditions, decisions regarding the acquisition and disposition of fund and separate account assets, and the specifics of client mandates will cause the amount of asset management, transaction and incentive fees to vary from one product to another.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	A substantial part of our fees are based upon the value of the assets we manage, and if asset values deteriorate, our asset management fees will decline as a result.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Our acquisition and disposition fees can decline as a result of delays in the deployment of capital or limited market liquidity.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P17_S3	We also earn incentive fees tied to portfolio performance, which fees may decline if there is a downturn in real estate markets and we fail to meet benchmarks or return hurdles.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Finally, during periods of economic weakness, recession or stagnation, existing and prospective clients in our Global Investment Management business may be less able or willing to commit new funds to real estate investments, which are inherently less liquid than many competing investment classes, thereby inhibiting the ability of our Global Investment Management business to raise new funds.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Additionally, investors with open commitments to provide additional investment capital could become less able or willing to honor their financial commitments and/or seek to renegotiate the terms of their commitments or the fees that they are obligated to pay.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P17_S6	To the extent that clients in our Global Investment Management business seek to avoid paying fees they are obligated to pay, or seek to avoid deploying capital that has been committed, we could experience a decrease in collection of fees and interruptions to our client relationships and business.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P17_S7	Our real estate investment and co-investment activities in our Global Investment Management as well as Development Services businesses subject us to real estate investment risks which could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flow.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P17_S8	An important part of the strategy for our Global Investment Management business involves co-investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients, and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P17_S9	As of December 31, 2014, we had committed $19.0 million to fund future co-investments in our Global Investment Management business, $12.7 million of which is expected to be funded during 2015.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P17_S10	In addition to required future capital contributions, some of the co-investment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P17_S11	The failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments, including damage to our reputation with our co-investment partners and clients, as well as the necessity of obtaining alternative funding from other sources that may be on disadvantageous terms for us and the other co-investors.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P17_S12	Participating as a co-investor is an important part of our Global Investment Management business, which might suffer if we were unable to make these investments.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	entities holding direct or indirect interests in co-investments, we may provide this capital in many instances in further support of the co-investment.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Selective investment in real estate projects is an important part of our Development Services business strategy, and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	As of December 31, 2014, we had 16 consolidated real estate projects with invested equity of $8.3 million.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	In addition, at December 31, 2014, we were involved as a principal (in most cases, co-investing with our clients) in approximately 60 unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries with invested equity of $110.5 million and had committed additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries of $25.5 million.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P19_S3	We also guaranteed outstanding notes payable of these unconsolidated subsidiaries of $10.1 million.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	During the ordinary course of our Development Services business, we provide numerous completion and budget guarantees requiring us to complete the relevant project within a specified timeframe and/or within a specified budget, with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	While we generally have guaranteed maximum price contracts with reputable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees (which are intended to pass most of the risk to such contractors), there can be no assurance that we will not have to perform under any such guarantees.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	If we are required to perform under a significant number of such guarantees, it could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Because the disposition of a single significant investment can affect our financial performance in any period, our real estate investment activities could increase fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flow.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P20_S4	In many cases, we have limited control over the timing of the disposition of these investments and the recognition of any related gain or loss, or incentive participation fee.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Poor performance of the investment programs that our Global Investment Management business manages would cause a decline in our revenue, net income and cash flow and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future programs.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P20_S6	In the event that any of the investment programs that our Global Investment Management business manages were to perform poorly, our revenue, net income and cash flow could decline because the value of the assets we manage would decrease, which would result in a reduction in some of our management fees, and our investment returns would decrease, resulting in a reduction in the incentive compensation we earn.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P20_S7	Moreover, we could experience losses on co-investments of our own capital in such programs as a result of poor performance.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P20_S8	Investors and potential investors in our programs continually assess our performance, and our ability to raise capital for existing and future programs and maintaining our current fee structure will depend on our continued satisfactory performance.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P20_S9	Our leverage and debt service obligations could harm our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P20_S10	We are leveraged and have debt service obligations.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P20_S11	As of December 31, 2014, our total debt, excluding notes payable on real estate (which are generally nonrecourse to us) and warehouse lines of credit (which are recourse only to our wholly-owned subsidiary, CBRE Capital Markets, and are secured by our related warehouse receivables), was approximately $1.9 billion.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P20_S12	For the year ended December 31, 2014, our interest expense was approximately $112.0 million.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P20_S13	On January 9, 2015, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement, which replaced our prior credit agreement.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P20_S14	The amended and restated credit agreement provides for a $2.6 billion revolving credit facility and a $500.0 million tranche A term loan facility, with the term facility fully drawn on the closing date of the new facility.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of, or other amounts due in respect of, our indebtedness.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or for other purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our debt, would increase.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P22_S2	If we are required to seek an amendment to our credit agreement to accomondate further leverage, our debt service obligations may be substantially increased.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Our debt could have other important consequences, which include, but are not limited to, the following:
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	our level of debt may restrict us from raising additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and other general corporate requirements.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	From time to time, Moody s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard Poor s Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., rate our significant outstanding debt.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P23_S2	These ratings and any downgrades thereof may affect our ability to borrow under any new agreements in the future, as well as the interest rates and other terms of any future borrowings, and could also cause a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock in addition to our outstanding debt instruments.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We cannot be certain that our earnings will be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	If we do not have sufficient earnings, we may be required to seek to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or sell more securities, none of which we can guarantee that we will be able to do and which, if accomplished, may adversely affect our stock price.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Our debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us, and in the event of a default, all of our borrowings would become immediately due and payable.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Our debt instruments, including our credit agreement, impose, and the terms of any future debt may impose, operating and other restrictions on us and many of our subsidiaries.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P24_S4	These restrictions affect, and in many respects limit or prohibit, our ability to:
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	finance ongoing operations, strategic acquisitions, investments or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest, including:
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our credit agreement currently requires us to maintain a minimum coverage ratio of EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) to total interest expense of 2.00x and a maximum leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) of 4.25x as of the end of each fiscal quarter.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot give assurance that we will be able to meet those ratios when required.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P26_S2	For example, we experienced a decline in EBITDA during the economic downturn in 2008 to 2009, which negatively affected our minimum coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Our coverage ratio of EBITDA to total interest expense was 12.34x for the year ended December 31, 2014 and our leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to EBITDA was 1.02x as of December 31, 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P26_S4	We continue to monitor our projected compliance with these financial ratios and other terms of our credit agreement.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P26_S5	A breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our debt instruments.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P26_S6	If any such default occurs, the lenders under our credit agreement may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P26_S7	The lenders under our credit agreement also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P26_S8	If we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due, the lenders under our credit agreement will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt, which collateral is described in the immediately following risk factor.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P26_S9	If the debt under our credit agreement were to be accelerated, we cannot give assurance that this collateral would be sufficient to repay our debt.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P26_S10	In addition, such a breach under our credit agreement could trigger a cross default or cross acceleration under our other debt instruments, including the notes under our indentures.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P26_S11	If we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under our credit agreement, the lenders under such credit agreement could foreclose on, and acquire control of, substantially all of our assets.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P26_S12	Our credit agreement is jointly and severally guaranteed by us and substantially all of our material domestic subsidiaries.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P26_S13	Borrowings under our credit agreement are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the capital stock of the U.S. subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, in each case, held by CBRE Services, Inc. and the U.S. guarantor subsidiaries.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P26_S14	In addition, in connection with any amendment to our credit agreement, we may need to grant additional collateral to the lenders.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P26_S15	If we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due, the lenders under our credit agreement will have the right to proceed against this pledged capital stock and take control of substantially all of our assets.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P26_S16	We have limited restrictions on the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur, which may intensify the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our indebtedness.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P26_S17	Subject to the maximum amounts of indebtedness permitted by our credit agreement covenants, we are not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur in connection with the financing of our development activities, and we may in the future incur such indebtedness in order to decrease the amount of equity we invest in these activities.

1138118_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	If we experience defaults by multiple clients or counterparties, it could adversely affect our business.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	We could be adversely affected by the actions, deteriorating financial condition and results of operations of certain of our clients or counterparties if that led to losses or defaults by one or more of them, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Any of our clients may experience a downturn in their business that may weaken their results of operations and financial condition.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P28_S3	As a result, a client may fail to make payments when due, become insolvent or declare bankruptcy.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Any client bankruptcy or insolvency, or the failure of any client to make payments when due, could result in losses to our company.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P28_S5	A client bankruptcy would delay or preclude full collection of amounts owed to us.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P28_S6	Additionally, certain occupier outsourcing and property management client agreements require that we advance payroll and other vendor costs on behalf of clients.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P28_S7	If such a client were to file bankruptcy or otherwise fail, we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for those costs or for the severance obligations we would incur as a result of the loss of the client.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P28_S8	The bankruptcy or insolvency of a significant counterparty (which may include co-brokers, lenders, insurance companies, hedging counterparties, service providers or other organizations with which we do business), or the failure of any significant counterparty to perform its contractual commitments, may result in disruption to our business or material losses to our company.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P28_S9	If the assets in our defined benefit pension plans are not sufficient to meet the plans obligations, we may be required to make cash contributions to it and our liquidity may be adversely affected.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our subsidiaries based in the United Kingdom maintain two contributory defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in the plans.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P29_S1	With respect to these plans, our historical policy has been to contribute annually, an amount to fund pension cost as actuarially determined and as required by applicable laws and regulations.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Our contributions to these plans are invested and, if these investments do not perform in the future as well as we expect, we will be required to provide additional funding to cover any shortfall.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P29_S3	The underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans included in pension liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, which are incorporated herein by reference, was $92.9 million and $68.0 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P29_S4	If the assets in our defined benefit pension plans continue to be insufficient to meet the plans obligations, we may be required to make substantial cash contributions preventing the use of such cash for other purposes and adversely affecting our liquidity.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P29_S5	Failure to maintain and execute information technology strategies and ensure that our employees adapt to changes in technology could materially and adversely affect our ability to remain competitive in the market.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our business relies heavily on information technology to deliver services that meet the needs of our clients.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	If we are unable to effectively execute our information technology strategies or adopt new technologies and processes relevant to our service platform, our ability to deliver high-quality services may be materially impaired.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P30_S2	In addition, we make significant investments in new systems and tools to achieve competitive advantages and efficiencies.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Implementation of such investments in information technology could exceed estimated budgets and we may experience challenges that prevent new strategies or technologies from being realized according to anticipated schedules.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P30_S4	If we are unable to maintain current information technology and processes or encounter delays, or fail to exploit new technologies, then the execution of our business plans may be disrupted.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P30_S5	Similarly, our employees require effective tools and techniques to perform functions integral to our business.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P30_S6	Failure to successfully provide such tools and systems, or ensure that employees have properly adopted them, could materially and adversely impact our ability to achieve positive business outcomes.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Failure to maintain the security of our information and technology networks, including personally identifiable and client information, intellectual property and proprietary business information could significantly adversely affect us.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Security breaches and other disruptions of our information and technology networks could compromise our information and intellectual property and expose us to liability, reputational harm and significant remediation costs, which could cause material harm to our business and financial results.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and intellectual property, and that of our clients and personally identifiable information of our employees and contractors, in our data centers and on our networks.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P32_S1	The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information are critical to our operations.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by third parties or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P32_S3	A significant actual or potential theft, loss, corruption, exposure, fraudulent use or misuse of client, employee or other personally identifiable or proprietary business data, whether by third parties or as a result of employee malfeasance or otherwise, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or intellectual property or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could result in significant remediation and other costs, fines, litigation or regulatory actions against us.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P32_S4	Such an event could additionally disrupt our operations and the services we provide to clients, damage our reputation, result in the loss of a competitive advantage, impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial data and cause a loss of confidence in our services and financial reporting, which could adversely affect our business, revenues, competitive position and investor confidence.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P32_S5	Additionally, we increasingly rely on third-party data storage providers, including cloud storage solution providers, resulting in less direct control over our data.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P32_S6	Such third parties are also vulnerable to security breaches and compromised security systems, for which we may not be indemnified and which could materially adversely affect us and our reputation.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P32_S7	Interruption or failure of our information technology, communications systems or data services could impair our ability to provide our services effectively, which could damage our reputation and materially harm our operating results.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P32_S8	Our business requires the continued operation of information technology and communication systems and network infrastructure.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P32_S9	Our ability to conduct our global business may be materially adversely affected by disruptions to these systems or infrastructure.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P32_S10	Our information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or disruption from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, system malfunctions, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and floods, acts of war or terrorism, employee errors or malfeasance, or other events which are beyond our control.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P32_S11	In addition, the operation and maintenance of these systems and networks is in some cases dependent on third-party technologies, systems and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P32_S12	Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays and loss, corruption or exposure of critical data or intellectual property and may also disrupt our ability to provide services to or interact with our clients, and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication or travel.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P32_S13	Furthermore, any such event could result in substantial recovery and remediation costs and liability to customers, business partners and other third parties.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P32_S14	We have disaster recovery plans and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events, but our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient and cannot account for all eventualities, and a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations, and as a result, our future operating results could be materially adversely affected.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P32_S15	The infrastructure disruptions we describe above may also disrupt our ability to manage real estate for clients or may adversely affect the value of real estate investments we make on behalf of clients.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The buildings we manage for clients, which include some of the world s largest office properties and retail centers, are used by numerous people daily.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P33_S1	As a result, fires, earthquakes, floods, other natural disasters, defects and terrorist attacks can result in significant loss of life, and, to the extent we are held to have been negligent in connection with our management of the affected properties, we could incur significant financial liabilities and reputational harm.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Our business relies heavily on the use of commercial real estate data.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P34_S1	A portion of this data is purchased or licensed from third-party providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P34_S2	A disruption of our ability to provide data to our professionals and/or our clients or an inadvertent exposure of proprietary data could damage our reputation and competitive position, and our operating results could be adversely affected.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P34_S3	A significant portion of our operations are concentrated in California and our business could be harmed if there was an economic downturn in the California real estate markets.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P34_S4	During 2014, approximately 10% of our revenue was generated from transactions originating in California.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	As a result of the geographic concentration in California, economic downturns in the California commercial real estate market, particularly in the local economies in Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties, could harm our results of operations and disproportionately affect our business as compared to competitors who have less or different geographic concentrations.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We have numerous local and global competitors across all of our business lines and the geographies that we serve, and further industry consolidation could lead to significant future competition.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P35_S2	We compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate services and investment industry, including commercial property and corporate facilities management, occupier and property/agency leasing, property sales, valuation, real estate investment management, commercial mortgage origination and servicing, capital markets (structured finance and debt) solutions, development services and proprietary research.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2014 revenue, our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies, property types and services and business lines.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P35_S4	Depending on the geography, property type or service or business line, we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers and investment firms, including outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have expanded their offerings, in-house corporate real estate departments, developers, institutional lenders, insurance companies, investment banking firms, investment managers and accounting and consulting firms.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P35_S5	Some of these firms may have greater financial resources allocated to a particular geography, property type or service or business line than we have allocated that geography, property type, service or business line.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P35_S6	In addition, future changes in laws could lead to the entry of other new competitors, such as financial institutions.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Although many of our existing competitors are local or regional firms that are smaller than we are, some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P36_S1	We are further subject to competition from large national and multi-national firms that have similar service and investment competencies to ours, and it is possible that further industry consolidation could lead to much larger and more formidable competitors globally or in the particular geographies, property types, service or business lines that we serve.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P36_S2	There is no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively, to maintain current fee levels or margins, or maintain or increase our market share.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Our goodwill and other intangible assets could become further impaired, which may require us to take significant non-cash charges against earnings.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Under current accounting guidelines, we must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P36_S5	Any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of such analysis would result in a non-cash charge against earnings, and such charge could materially adversely affect our reported results of operations, stockholders equity and our stock price.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P36_S6	For example, during the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a non-amortizable intangible asset impairment of $98.1 million in our Global Investment Management segment.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P36_S7	This non-cash write-off was related to a decrease in value of our open-end funds, primarily in Europe.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P36_S8	A significant and sustained decline in our future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the economic environment, slower growth rates or if our stock price falls below our net book value per share for a sustained period, could result in the need to perform additional impairment analysis in future periods.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P36_S9	If we were to conclude that a future write-down of goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary, then we would record such additional charges, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We operate in many jurisdictions with complex and varied tax regimes.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Changes in tax rules or the outcome of tax assessments and audits could adversely affect our results.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We operate in many jurisdictions with complex and varied tax regimes, and are subject to different forms of taxation resulting in a variable effective tax rate.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P38_S1	In addition, from time to time we engage in transactions across different tax jurisdictions.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Due to the different tax laws in the many jurisdictions where we operate, we are often required to make subjective determinations.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P39_S1	The tax authorities in the various jurisdictions where we carry on business may not agree with the determinations that are made by us with respect to the application of tax law.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Such disagreements could result in disputes and, ultimately, in the payment of additional funds to the government authorities in the jurisdictions where we carry on business, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P39_S3	In addition, changes in tax rules or the outcome of tax assessments and audits could have an adverse effect on our results in any particular quarter.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our estimate of tax related assets, liabilities, recoveries and expenses incorporates assumptions.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P40_S1	These assumptions include, but are not limited to, the tax laws in various jurisdictions, the effect of tax treaties between jurisdictions, taxable income projections, and the benefits of various restructuring plans.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P40_S2	To the extent that such assumptions differ from actual results, we may have to record additional income tax expenses and liabilities.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P40_S3	We are subject to the possibility of loss contingencies arising out of tax claims, assessments related to uncertain tax positions and provisions for specifically identified income tax exposures.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P40_S4	There are currently tax audits ongoing in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P40_S5	There can be no assurance that we will be successful in resolving potential tax claims that arise from these audits.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P40_S6	Although we have recorded provisions on the basis of the best current understanding, we could be required to book additional provisions in future periods for amounts that cannot be assessed at this stage.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P40_S7	Our failure to do so and/or the need to increase our provisions for such claims could have an adverse effect on our financial position.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P40_S8	We are subject to substantial litigation risks and may face significant liabilities and/or damage to our professional reputation as a result of litigation allegations and negative publicity.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P40_S9	As a licensed real estate broker, our licensed employees and we are subject to regulatory due diligence, disclosure and standard-of-care obligations.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P40_S10	Failure to fulfill these obligations could subject us or our employees to litigation from parties who purchased, sold or leased properties that we or they brokered or managed.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P40_S11	We could become subject to claims by participants in real estate sales, as well as building owners and companies for whom we provide management services, alleging that we did not fulfill our regulatory and fiduciary obligations.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	In addition, in our property management business, we hire and supervise third-party contractors to provide construction services for our managed properties.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P41_S1	While our role is limited to that of an agent for the owner, we may be subject to claims for construction defects or other similar actions.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P41_S2	The advice and services we render in our financial and valuation advisory businesses, the investment decisions we make in our Global Investment Management business and the activities of our investment banking and investment management professionals for or on behalf of our clients may subject them and us to the risk of third-party litigation.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Such litigation may arise from client or investor dissatisfaction with the performance of our programs, differences between actual values and appraised values, and a variety of other litigation claims, including allegations that we improperly exercised judgment, discretion, control or influence over client investments or that we breached fiduciary duties to clients.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P41_S4	For example, in our valuation and appraisal business, if market dynamics lead to a reduction in the market value of properties we have previously appraised, we may be subject to a higher risk of claims, including conflicts of interest claims, based on the circumstances of valuations previously issued.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our valuation and appraisal services involve transactions where the value of the transaction is much greater than the fees we generate.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P42_S1	As a result, the consequences of errors that lead to damages might be disproportionately large in relation to the fees generated in the event our contractual protections or our insurance coverage are inadequate to protect us fully.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	To the extent investors in our programs suffer losses resulting from fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or other similar misconduct, investors may have remedies against us, our investment programs or funds or our employees under federal securities laws and applicable state laws.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Moreover, we are exposed to risks of litigation or investigation by investors and regulators relating to allegations of our having engaged in transactions involving conflicts of interest that were not properly addressed.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P43_S2	We maintain commercial insurance in amounts we believe are appropriate to mitigate litigation risk.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P43_S3	But, in the event of a substantial loss, our commercial insurance coverage and/or self-insurance reserve levels might not be sufficient to pay the full damages, the scope of available coverage may not cover certain types of claims, or such insurance may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P43_S4	Further, the value of otherwise valid claims we hold under insurance policies could become uncollectible in the event of the covering insurance companies insolvency.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P43_S5	Any of these events could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P43_S6	We depend on our business relationships and our reputation for integrity and high-caliber professional services to attract and retain clients across our overall business, as well as investors for our Global Investment Management business.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P43_S7	As a result, allegations by private litigants or regulators of conflicts of interest or improper conduct by us, whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us, as well as negative publicity and press speculation about us or our investment activities, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and damage our business prospects both in our Global Investment Management business and our other businesses.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P43_S8	In addition, if any lawsuits were brought against us and resulted in a finding of substantial legal liability, it could materially, adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us, which could materially impact our business.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P43_S9	A failure to appropriately deal with actual or perceived conflicts of interest could adversely affect our businesses.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P43_S10	Our company has a global platform with different business lines and a broad client base and is therefore subject to numerous potential, actual or perceived conflicts of interests in the provision of services to our existing and potential clients.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P43_S11	For example, conflicts may arise from our position as broker to both owners and tenants in commercial real estate lease transactions.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P43_S12	We have adopted various policies, controls and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts, but these policies and procedures may not be adequate and may not be adhered to by our employees.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P43_S13	Appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged and cause us to lose existing clients or fail to gain new clients if we fail, or appear to fail, to identify, disclose and manage potential conflicts of interest, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P43_S14	In addition, it is possible that in some jurisdictions regulations could be changed to limit our ability to act for parties where conflicts exist even with informed consent, which could limit our market share in those markets.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	There can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P44_S1	If we fail to maintain and protect our intellectual property, or infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, our business could be harmed and we could incur financial penalties.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Our business depends, in part, on our ability to identify and protect proprietary information and other intellectual property (such as our service marks, client lists and information, business methods and research).
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Existing laws, or the application of those laws, of some countries in which we operate may offer only limited protections for our intellectual property rights.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P44_S4	We rely on a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality policies, non-disclosure and other contractual arrangements, and on copyright, trademark and other intellectual property laws to protect our intellectual property rights.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P44_S5	Our inability to detect unauthorized use or take appropriate or timely steps to enforce our rights may have an adverse effect on our business.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We cannot be sure that the intellectual property that we may use in the course of operating our business or the services we offer to clients does not infringe on the rights of third parties, and we may have infringement claims asserted against us or against our clients.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P45_S1	These claims may harm our reputation, cost us money and prevent us from offering some services.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Confidential intellectual property is increasingly stored or carried on mobile devices, such as laptop computers, which makes inadvertent disclosure more of a risk in the event the mobile devices are lost or stolen and the information has not been adequately safeguarded or encrypted.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected by new laws or regulations or by changes in existing laws or regulations or the application thereof.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P47_S1	If we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us, including in our role as a real estate broker, registered investment advisor, mortgage broker, property/facility manager or developer, we may incur significant financial penalties.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P47_S2	We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations specific to the services we perform in our business.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions and the provision of property management and valuation services require us and our employees to maintain applicable licenses in each U.S. state and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we perform these services.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P47_S4	If we and our employees fail to maintain our licenses or conduct these activities without a license, or violate any of the regulations covering our licenses, we may be required to pay fines (including treble damages in certain states) or return commissions received or have our licenses suspended or revoked.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P47_S5	A number of our services, including the services provided by our indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, CBRE Capital Markets and CBRE Global Investors, are subject to regulation by the SEC, FINRA or other self-regulatory organizations and state securities regulators and compliance failures or regulatory action could adversely affect our business.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P47_S6	We could be subject to disciplinary or other actions in the future due to claimed noncompliance with these regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P47_S7	We are also subject to laws of broader applicability, such as tax, securities, environmental and employment laws, including the Fair Labor Standards Act, occupational health and safety regulations and state wage-and-hour laws.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P47_S8	Failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of significant fines by governmental authorities, awards of damages to private litigants and significant amounts paid in legal fees or settlements of these matters.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P48_S0	As the size and scope of our business has increased significantly during the past several years, both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with numerous licensing and other regulatory requirements and the possible loss resulting from non-compliance have increased.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P48_S1	The global economic crisis has resulted in increased government and legislative activities, including the introduction of new legislation and changes to rules and regulations, which we expect will continue into the future.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P48_S2	New or revised legislation or regulations applicable to our business, both within and outside of the United States, as well as changes in administrations or enforcement priorities may have an adverse effect on our business, including increasing the costs of regulatory compliance or preventing us from providing certain types of services in certain jurisdictions or in connection with certain transactions or clients.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P48_S3	We are unable to predict how any of these new laws, rules, regulations and proposals will be implemented or in what form, or whether any additional or similar changes to laws or regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, will occur in the future.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P48_S4	Any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We may be subject to environmental liability as a result of our role as a property or facility manager or developer of real estate.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Various laws and regulations impose liability on real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating, cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P51_S0	our role as a property or facility manager or developer, we could be held liable as an operator for such costs.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P51_S1	This liability may be imposed without regard to the legality of the original actions and without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P51_S2	If we fail to disclose environmental issues, we could also be liable to a buyer or lessee of a property.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P51_S3	If we incur any such liability, our business could suffer significantly as it could be difficult for us to develop or sell such properties, or borrow funds using such properties as collateral.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P51_S4	In the event of a substantial liability, our insurance coverage might be insufficient to pay the full damages, or the scope of available coverage may not cover certain of these liabilities.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P51_S5	Additionally, liabilities incurred to comply with more stringent future environmental requirements could adversely affect any or all of our lines of business.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P52_S0	This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P52_S1	The words anticipate, believe, could, should, propose, continue, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, predict, project, will and similar terms and phrases are used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to identify forward-looking statements.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Except for historical information contained herein, the matters addressed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking statements.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P53_S0	These statements relate to analyses and other information based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P53_S1	These statements also relate to our future prospects, developments and business strategies.
1138118_15_ITEM1A_P53_S2	These forward-looking statements are made based on our management s expectations and beliefs concerning future events affecting us and are subject to uncertainties and factors relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control.

1138118_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	of December 31, 2014: Some of our offices that contain employees of our Global Investment Management or our Development Services segments also contain employees of our other business segments.
1138118_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	Often, the employees of these segments occupy separate suites in the same building in order to operate the businesses independently with standalone offices.
1138118_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	We have provided above office totals by geographic region and not listed all of our Global Investment Management and Development Services offices to avoid double counting.
1138118_15_ITEM2_P1_S1	In general, these leased offices are fully utilized.
1138118_15_ITEM2_P2_S0	The most significant terms of the leasing arrangements for our offices are the length of the lease and the rent.
1138118_15_ITEM2_P2_S1	Our leases have terms varying in duration.
1138118_15_ITEM2_P2_S2	The rent payable under our office leases varies significantly from location to location as a result of differences in prevailing commercial real estate rates in different geographic locations.
1138118_15_ITEM2_P3_S0	Our management believes that no single office lease is material to our business, results of operations or financial condition.
1138118_15_ITEM2_P3_S1	In addition, we believe there is adequate alternative office space available at acceptable rental rates to meet our needs, although adverse movements in rental rates in some markets may negatively affect our profits in those markets when we enter into new leases.
1138118_15_ITEM2_P3_S2	We do not own any of these offices, which is consistent with our strategy to lease instead of own.
1138118_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	management believes that any losses in excess of the amounts accrued arising from such lawsuits are unlikely to be significant, but that litigation is inherently uncertain and there is the potential for a material adverse effect on our financial statements if one or more matters are resolved in a particular period in an amount materially in excess of that anticipated by management.
1138118_15_ITEM5_P0_S0	the last two fiscal years, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange, are set forth below for the periods indicated.
1138118_15_ITEM5_P1_S0	The closing share price for our Class A common stock on December 31, 2014, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange, was $34.25.
1138118_15_ITEM5_P1_S1	As of February 13, 2015, there were 258 stockholders of record of our Class A common stock.
1138118_15_ITEM5_P1_S2	We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on any class of our common stock since our inception on February 20, 2001, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.
1138118_15_ITEM5_P1_S3	We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance future growth and possibly reduce debt.
1138118_15_ITEM5_P1_S4	Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors that the board of directors deems relevant.
1138118_15_ITEM5_P1_S5	In addition, our ability to declare and pay cash dividends is restricted by the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility and senior secured term loan facilities.

1138118_15_ITEM6_P2_S0	(1) In 2011, we acquired the majority of the real estate investment management business of Netherlands-based ING Group N.V. (ING).
1138118_15_ITEM6_P2_S1	The acquisitions included substantially all of ING s Real Estate Investment Management (REIM) operations in Europe and Asia as well as substantially all of Clarion Real Estate Securities (CRES), its U.S.-based global real estate listed securities business (collectively referred to as ING REIM) along with certain CRES co-investments from ING and additional interests in other funds managed by ING REIM Europe and ING REIM Asia.
1138118_15_ITEM6_P2_S2	On July 1, 2011, we completed the acquisition of CRES for $332.8 million and CRES co-investments from ING for an aggregate amount of $58.6 million.
1138118_15_ITEM6_P2_S3	On October 3, 2011, we completed the acquisition of ING REIM Asia for $45.3 million and three ING REIM Asia co-investments from ING for an aggregate amount of $13.9 million.
1138118_15_ITEM6_P2_S4	On October 31, 2011, we completed the acquisition of ING REIM Europe for $441.5 million and one co-investment from ING for $7.4 million.
1138118_15_ITEM6_P2_S5	During the year ended December 31, 2012, we also funded nine additional co-investments for an aggregate amount of $34.5 million related to ING REIM Europe.
1138118_15_ITEM6_P2_S6	The results for the year ended December 31, 2011 include the operations of CRES, ING REIM Asia and ING REIM Europe from July 1, 2011, October 3, 2011 and October 31, 2011, respectively, the dates each respective business was acquired.
1138118_15_ITEM6_P3_S0	(2) EPS represents earnings per share.
1138118_15_ITEM6_P3_S1	See Earnings Per Share information in Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_15_ITEM6_P4_S0	EBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.
1138118_15_ITEM6_P4_S1	Our management believes EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions.
1138118_15_ITEM6_P4_S2	Such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.
1138118_15_ITEM6_P4_S3	As a result, our management uses EBITDA as a measure to evaluate the operating performance of our various business segments and for other discretionary purposes, including as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive programs.
1138118_15_ITEM6_P4_S4	Additionally, we believe EBITDA is useful to investors to assist them in getting a more complete picture of our results of operations.
1138118_15_ITEM6_P4_S5	However, EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under GAAP and when analyzing our operating performance, readers should use EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP.
1138118_15_ITEM6_P4_S6	Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
1138118_15_ITEM6_P4_S7	Furthermore, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management s discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.
1138118_15_ITEM6_P4_S8	The amounts shown for EBITDA also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
1138118_15_ITEM6_P5_S0	EBITDA is calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_15_ITEM6_P6_S0	(4) Notes payable on real estate disclosed here includes the current and long-term portions of notes payable on real estate as well as notes payable included in liabilities related to real estate and other assets held for sale.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	We are the world s largest commercial real estate services and investment firm, based on 2014 revenue, with leading full-service operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P0_S1	We offer a full range of services to occupiers, owners, lenders and investors in office, retail, industrial, multifamily and other types of commercial real estate.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P0_S2	As of December 31, 2014, excluding independent affiliates, we operated in over 370 offices worldwide, with more than 52,000 employees providing commercial real estate services under the CBRE brand name, investment management services under the CBRE Global Investors brand name and development services under the Trammell Crow brand name.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P0_S3	Our business is focused on several competencies, including commercial property and corporate facilities management, tenant/occupier and property/agency leasing, capital markets solutions (property sales, commercial mortgage origination and servicing, and debt/structured finance) real estate investment management, valuation, development services and proprietary research.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P0_S4	We generate revenue from management fees on a contractual and per-project basis, and from commissions on transactions.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P0_S5	In 2014, we were the highest ranked commercial real estate services company among the Fortune Most Admired Companies, and we ranked seventh among all companies on the Barron s 500, which evaluates companies on growth and financial performance.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P0_S6	We have been the only commercial real estate services and investment firm included in the S P 500 since 2006, and in the Fortune 500 since 2008.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P0_S7	Additionally, the International Association of Outsourcing Professionals (IAOP) has included us among the top 100 global outsourcing companies across all industries for nine consecutive years.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P0_S8	In 2014, the IAOP ranked us as a top three service provider among all outsourcing companies globally and as the highest ranked commercial real estate services company for the fifth consecutive year.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	When you read our financial statements and the information included in this section, you should consider that we have experienced, and continue to experience, several material trends and uncertainties that have affected our financial condition and results of operations that make it challenging to predict our future performance based on our historical results.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	We believe that the following material trends and uncertainties are crucial to an understanding of the variability in our historical earnings and cash flows and the potential for continued variability in the future: Macroeconomic Conditions Economic trends and government policies affect global and regional commercial real estate markets as well as our operations directly.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P1_S2	These include: overall economic activity and employment growth, interest rate levels, the cost and availability of credit and the impact of tax and regulatory policies.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P1_S3	Periods of economic weakness or recession, significantly rising interest rates, fiscal uncertainty, declining employment levels, decreasing demand for commercial real estate, falling real estate values, disruption to the global capital or credit markets, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, will negatively affect the performance of some of our business lines.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P1_S4	Compensation is our largest expense and the sales and leasing professionals in our advisory services business generally are paid on a commission and bonus basis that correlates with their revenue production.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P1_S5	As a result, the negative effect of difficult market conditions on our operating margins is partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P1_S6	In addition, when negative economic conditions are particularly severe, we have moved decisively to lower operating expenses to improve financial performance, and then have restored certain expenses as economic conditions improved.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P1_S7	Nevertheless, adverse global and regional economic trends could be significant risks to the performance of our operations and our financial condition.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	Commercial real estate markets have recovered over the past five years in step with the steady improvement in global economic activity, most particularly in the United States.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	and higher rents, as well as the availability of low-cost credit and increased capital flows into commercial real estate.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	U.S. leasing markets have also recovered, with falling vacancies, higher rents and increased transaction activity.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	European economies began to emerge from recession in 2013, with most countries there returning to positive, albeit very modest, economic growth.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	Reflecting the macro environment, property sales have increased significantly over the past two years, with higher volumes occurring across much of Europe in 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P4_S2	Leasing markets outside of the United Kingdom have been slower to recover, but did show some improvement in 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P4_S3	In Asia Pacific, leasing activity picked up in 2014, but strong construction activity limits future rent growth.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	Investment markets have generally been stronger than leasing markets, and while investment levels have varied across the region, some countries like Australia and Japan have been notably strong.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	Real estate investment management and property development activity has generally improved since 2010 as the real estate credit markets recovered and capital flows into commercial real estate have been strong.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P5_S2	The performance of our global sales, leasing, investment management and development services operations depends on sustained economic growth, strong job creation, stable, healthy global credit markets and continued improved business and investor sentiment.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P5_S3	Effects of Acquisitions Our management historically has made significant use of strategic acquisitions to add new service competencies, to increase our scale within existing competencies and to expand our presence in various geographic regions around the world.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P5_S4	In 2013, we fortified our real estate outsourcing platform in Europe within our EMEA segment with the acquisition of London-based Norland Managed Services Ltd (Norland) for approximately $474 million, which figure includes approximately $40 million deferred purchase price paid in 2014 (the Norland Acquisition).
1138118_15_ITEM7_P5_S5	Norland is a premier provider of building technical engineering services that enables us to self-perform these services in Europe and adds to our expertise in the highly specialized critical environments market.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P5_S6	Strategic in-fill acquisitions have also played a key role in expanding our geographic coverage and broadening and strengthening our service offerings.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P5_S7	The companies we acquired have generally been quality regional or specialty firms that complement our existing platform within a region, or affiliates in which, in some cases, we held a small equity interest.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P5_S8	During 2014, we completed 11 in-fill acquisitions, including our former affiliate companies in Thailand, Greenville, South Carolina, Louisville, Kentucky and Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Oklahoma, a commercial real estate service provider in Chicago, a New York-based valuation and advisory business, a technical real estate consulting firm based in Germany, a consulting and advisory firm in the U.S. hotels sector, a shopping center management, leasing and consulting company in Switzerland and project management companies in Germany and Australia.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P5_S9	During 2013, we completed ten in-fill acquisitions, including a firm serving the London prime residential real estate market, a regional commercial real estate services firm based in San Francisco, a retail real estate services firm in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region, a facility consulting and project advisory firm based in Virginia serving the healthcare industry, and two property management specialist firms, one in the Czech Republic and Slovakia and one in Belgium.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P5_S10	In January 2015, we acquired a Texas-based commercial real estate firm specializing in retail services.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	Although our management believes that strategic acquisitions can significantly decrease the cost, time and commitment of management resources necessary to attain a meaningful competitive position within targeted markets or to expand our presence within our current markets, in general, most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating and net income, both as a result of transaction-related expenditures, which include severance, lease termination, transaction and deferred financing costs, among others, and the charges and costs of integrating the acquired business and its financial and accounting systems into our own.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	acquisition structures often include deferred and/or contingent purchase price payments in future periods that are subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	As of December 31, 2014, we have accrued for deferred consideration totaling $125.2 million, which was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	International Operations As we increase our international operations through either acquisitions or organic growth, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	Our Global Investment Management business has a significant amount of Euro-denominated assets under management, or AUM, as well as associated revenue and earnings in Europe, which has recently seen more pronounced (and adverse) movement in the value of the Euro against the U.S. dollar.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P8_S2	Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have resulted and may continue to result in corresponding fluctuations in our AUM, revenue and earnings.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P8_S3	Our management team generally seeks to mitigate our exposure by balancing assets and liabilities that are denominated in the same currency.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P8_S4	Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported amounts of our total assets and liabilities, which are reflected in our financial statements as translated into U.S. dollars for each financial reporting period at the exchange rate in effect on the respective balance sheet dates, and our total revenue and expenses, which are reflected in our financial statements as translated into U.S. dollars for each financial reporting period at the monthly average exchange rate.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P8_S5	During the year ended December 31, 2014, foreign currency translation had a $53.5 million negative impact on our total revenue and a $49.5 million positive impact on our total cost of services and operating, administrative and other expenses.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P8_S6	In addition, from time to time we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to attempt to mitigate some of our exposure to exchange rate changes related to particular transactions and to hedge risks associated with the translation of certain foreign currencies into U.S. dollars.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P8_S7	During the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately 44% of our business was transacted in local currencies of foreign countries, the majority of which includes the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Euro, Indian rupee, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P8_S8	Although we operate globally, we report our results in U.S. dollars.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P8_S9	As a result, the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar may positively or negatively impact our reported results.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	The following table sets forth our revenue derived from our most significant currencies (dollars in thousands):
1138118_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	We estimate that had the British pound sterling-to-U.S. dollar exchange rates been 10% higher during the year ended December 31, 2014, the net impact would have been an increase in pre-tax income of $9.3 million.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	This hypothetical calculation estimates the impact of translating results into U.S. dollars and does not include an estimate of the impact a 10% change in the U.S. dollar against other currencies would have had on our foreign operations.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	Due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	Our international operations also are subject to, among other things, political instability and changing regulatory environments, which may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P11_S3	Our management routinely monitors these risks and related costs and evaluates the appropriate amount of resources to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P11_S4	We are leveraged and have debt service obligations.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P11_S5	As of December 31, 2014, our total debt excluding our notes payable on real estate (which are generally nonrecourse to us) and warehouse lines of credit (which are recourse only to our wholly-owned subsidiary, CBRE Capital Markets, Inc., or CBRE Capital Markets, and are secured by our related warehouse receivables) was approximately $1.9 billion.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P11_S6	Our level of indebtedness and the operating and financial restrictions in our debt agreements place some constraints on the operation of our business.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P11_S7	Although our management believes that long-term indebtedness has been an important lever in the development of our business, including facilitating the acquisition of the majority of the real estate investment management business of Netherlands-based ING Group N.V. (the REIM Acquisitions) and the Norland Acquisition, the cash flow necessary to service this debt is not available for other general corporate purposes, which may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in the commercial real estate services industry.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P11_S8	Our management seeks to mitigate this exposure both through the refinancing of debt when available on attractive terms and through selective repayment and retirement of indebtedness.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P11_S9	For example, during 2014, we completed three financing transactions, and in January 2015 we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P11_S10	The 2014 transactions included the issuance in September 2014 and December 2014 of $300.0 million and $125.0 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due March 15, 2025 and the redemption in October 2014 of all of the then outstanding 6.625% senior notes (aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million).
1138118_15_ITEM7_P11_S11	During the year ended December 31, 2014, in connection with these financing activities, we incurred approximately $4.7 million of financing costs.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P11_S12	In addition, we expensed $5.7 million of previously-deferred financing costs as well as a $17.4 million early extinguishment premium.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that management believes to be reasonable.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P12_S2	Actual results may differ from those estimates.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P12_S3	We believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
1138118_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	Revenue Recognition In order for us to recognize revenue, there are four basic criteria that must be met:
1138118_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	Our revenue recognition policies are consistent with these criteria.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	The judgments involved in revenue recognition include understanding the complex terms of agreements and determining the appropriate time to recognize revenue for each transaction based on such terms.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	Each transaction is evaluated to determine: (i) at what point in time revenue is earned, (ii) whether contingencies exist that impact the timing of recognition of revenue and (iii) how and when such contingencies will be resolved.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P15_S2	The timing of revenue recognition could vary if different judgments were made.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P15_S3	Our revenues subject to the most judgment are brokerage commission revenue and incentive-based management and development fees.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P15_S4	We record commission revenue on real estate sales generally upon close of escrow or transfer of title, except when future contingencies exist.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P15_S5	Real estate commissions on leases are generally recorded in revenue when all obligations under the commission agreement are satisfied.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	Terms and conditions of a commission agreement may include, but are not limited to, execution of a signed lease agreement and future contingencies including tenant occupancy, payment of a deposit or payment of a first month s rent (or a combination thereof).
1138118_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	As some of these conditions are outside of our control and are often not clearly defined, judgment must be exercised in determining when such required events have occurred in order to recognize revenue.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	A typical commission agreement provides that we earn a portion of a lease commission upon the execution of the lease agreement by the tenant and landlord, with the remaining portion(s) of the lease commission earned at a later date, usually upon tenant occupancy or payment of rent.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	The existence of any significant future contingencies results in the delay of recognition of corresponding revenue until such contingencies are satisfied.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P17_S2	For example, if we do not earn all or a portion of the lease commission until the tenant pays its first month s rent, and the lease agreement provides the tenant with a free rent period, we delay revenue recognition until rent is paid by the tenant.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	Property and facilities management revenues are generally based upon percentages of the revenue or base rent generated by the entities managed or the square footage managed.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	These fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related management agreements.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	Investment management fees are based predominantly upon a percentage of the equity deployed on behalf of our limited partners.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	Fees related to our indirect investment management programs are based upon a percentage of the fair value of those investments.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P19_S2	These fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related investment management agreements.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P19_S3	Our Global Investment Management segment also earns performance-based incentive fees with regard to many of its investments.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P19_S4	Such revenue is recognized at the end of the measurement periods when the conditions of the applicable incentive fee arrangements have been satisfied and following the expiration of any potential claw back provision.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P19_S5	With many of these investments, our Global Investment Management professionals have participation interests in such incentive fees, which are commonly referred to as carried interest.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P19_S6	This carried interest expense is generally accrued for based upon the probability of such performance-based incentive fees being earned over the related vesting period.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P19_S7	In addition, our Global Investment Management segment also earns success-based transaction fees with regard to buying or selling properties on behalf of certain funds and separate accounts.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P19_S8	Such revenue is recognized at the completion of a successful transaction and is not subject to any claw back provision.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	We earn development and incentive development fees in our Development Services segment.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	Development fees are generally based on a percentage of a defined cost measure and are recognized at the lower of the amount billed or the amount determined on a straight-line basis over the development period.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P20_S2	Incentive development fees are recognized when quantitative criteria have been met (such as specified leasing or budget targets) or, for those incentive fees based on qualitative criteria, upon approval of the fee by our clients.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	development fees allow us to share in the fair value of the developed real estate asset above cost.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	This sharing creates additional revenue potential to us with no exposure to loss other than opportunity cost.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P21_S2	Our incentive development fee revenue is recognized to the extent that future performance contingencies have been resolved.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P21_S3	The unique nature and complexity of each incentive fee requires us to use varying levels of judgment in determining the timing of revenue recognition.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	In establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables, we make assumptions with respect to future collectability.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	Our assumptions are based on an assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends, including the aging of receivables balances.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P22_S2	In addition to these assessments, in general, outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are more than 180 days overdue are evaluated for collectability and fully provided for if deemed uncollectible.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	Historically, our credit losses have generally been insignificant.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	However, estimating losses requires significant judgment, and conditions may change or new information may become known after any periodic evaluation.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P23_S2	As a result, actual credit losses may differ from our estimates.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majority-owned subsidiaries, as well as variable interest entities, or VIEs, in which we are the primary beneficiary and other subsidiaries we control.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	The equity attributable to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries is shown separately in our consolidated balance sheets included elsewhere in this report.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P24_S2	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	Variable Interest Entities As required by the Consolidations Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, or Topic 810, we consolidate all VIEs in which we are the entity s primary beneficiary.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	A reporting entity is determined to be the primary beneficiary if it holds a controlling financial interest in the VIE.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P25_S2	(2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from such entity that could potentially be significant to such entity.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P25_S3	The entity which satisfies these criteria is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	We determine if an entity is a VIE based on several factors, including whether the entity s total equity investment at risk upon inception is sufficient to finance the entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	We make judgments regarding the sufficiency of the equity at risk based first on a qualitative analysis, then a quantitative analysis, if necessary.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	We analyze any investments in VIEs to determine if we are the primary beneficiary.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	We consider a variety of factors in identifying the entity that holds the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance including, but not limited to, the ability to direct financing, leasing, construction and other operating decisions and activities.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P27_S2	In addition, we consider the rights of other investors to participate in those decisions, to replace the manager and to sell or liquidate the entity.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P27_S3	We also have several co-investments in real estate investment funds which qualify for a deferral of the qualitative approach for analyzing potential VIEs.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P27_S4	We continue to analyze these investments under the former quantitative method incorporating various estimates, including estimated future cash flows, asset hold periods and discount rates, as well as estimates of the probabilities of various scenarios occurring.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	If the entity is a VIE, we then determine whether we consolidate the entity as the primary beneficiary.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	This determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary includes any impact of an upside economic interest in the form of a promote that we may have.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	A promote is an interest built into the distribution structure of the entity based on the entity s achievement of certain return hurdles.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	We consolidate any VIE of which we are the primary beneficiary (see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report) and disclose significant VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary, if any, as well as disclose our maximum exposure to loss related to VIEs that are not consolidated.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	We determine whether an entity is a VIE and, if so, whether it should be consolidated by utilizing judgments and estimates that are inherently subjective.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P30_S2	If an entity is not a VIE, our determination of the appropriate accounting method with respect to our investments in limited partnerships, limited liability companies and other subsidiaries is based on voting control.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P30_S3	For our general partner interests, we are presumed to control (and therefore consolidate) the entity, unless the other limited partners have substantive rights that overcome this presumption of control.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P30_S4	These substantive rights allow the limited partners to remove the general partner with or without cause or to participate in significant decisions made in the ordinary course of the entity s business.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P30_S5	We account for our non-controlling general partner investments in these entities under the equity method.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P30_S6	This treatment also applies to our managing member interests in limited liability companies.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P30_S7	Other Investments Our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, but do not control, or entities which are variable interest entities in which we are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for under the equity method.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P30_S8	Accordingly, our share of the earnings from these equity-method basis companies is included in consolidated net income.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P30_S9	All other investments held on a long-term basis are valued at cost less any impairment in value.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	Our determination of the appropriate accounting treatment for an investment in a subsidiary requires judgment of several factors, including the size and nature of our ownership interest and the other owners substantive rights to make decisions for the entity.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	If we were to make different judgments or conclusions as to the level of our control or influence, it could result in a different accounting treatment.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P31_S2	Accounting for an investment as either consolidated or using the equity method generally would have no impact on our net income or stockholders equity in any accounting period, but a different treatment would impact individual income statement and balance sheet items, as consolidation would effectively gross up our income statement and balance sheet.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P31_S3	If our evaluation of an investment accounted for using the cost method was different, it could result in our being required to account for an investment by consolidation or by the equity method.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	Under the cost method, the investor only records its share of the underlying entity s earnings to the extent that it receives dividends from the investee; when the dividends received by the investor exceed the investor s share of the investee s earnings subsequent to the date of the investor s investment, the investor records a reduction in the basis of its investment.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	Under the cost method, the investor does not record its share of losses of the investee.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P32_S2	Conversely, under either consolidation or equity method accounting, the investor effectively records its share of the underlying entity s net income or loss, or its guarantees of the underlying entity s debt.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	Impairment Evaluation Under either the equity or cost method, impairment losses are recognized upon evidence of other-than-temporary losses of value.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	When testing for impairment on investments that are not actively traded on a public market, we generally use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our investments and/or look to comparable activities in the marketplace.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P34_S1	Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow approach.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P34_S2	These assumptions include net asset values, internal rates of return, discount and capitalization rates, interest rates and financing terms, rental rates, timing of leasing activity, estimates of lease terms and related concessions, etc.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P34_S3	When determining if impairment is other-than-temporary, we also look to the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been less than cost as well as the financial condition and near-term prospects of each investment.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting, which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	In determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, we use a variety of valuation methods including present value, depreciated replacement cost, market values (where available) and selling prices less costs to dispose.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	We are responsible for determining the valuation of assets and liabilities and for the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	Assumptions must often be made in determining fair values, particularly where observable market values do not exist.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	Assumptions may include discount rates, growth rates, cost of capital, royalty rates, tax rates and remaining useful lives.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P38_S2	These assumptions can have a significant impact on the value of identifiable assets and accordingly can impact the value of goodwill recorded.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P38_S3	Different assumptions could result in different values being attributed to assets and liabilities.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P38_S4	Since these values impact the amount of annual depreciation and amortization expense, different assumptions could also impact our statement of operations and could impact the results of future impairment reviews.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	The majority of our goodwill balance has resulted from our acquisition of CBRE Services, Inc, or CBRE, in 2001 (the 2001 Acquisition), our acquisition of Insignia Financial Group, Inc., or Insignia, in 2003 (the Insignia Acquisition), the Trammell Crow Company Acquisition in 2006, the REIM Acquisitions in 2011 and the Norland Acquisition in 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	Other intangible assets that have indefinite estimated useful lives and are not being amortized include certain management contracts identified in the REIM Acquisitions, a trademark, which was separately identified as a result of the 2001 Acquisition, and a trade name separately identified as a result of the REIM Acquisitions.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P39_S2	The remaining other intangible assets primarily include customer relationships, management contracts and loan servicing rights, which are all being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging up to 20 years.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P39_S3	We are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	The goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step process.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	The first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	We use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P41_S2	Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P41_S3	These assumptions include revenue growth rates, profit margin percentages, discount rates, etc.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered to not be impaired.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	The second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P43_S1	The implied fair value of goodwill is determined similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination, by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one, over the estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P43_S2	Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business s fair value and the relative size of our goodwill, if different assumptions and estimates were used, it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	Our annual assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives has historically been completed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	When we performed our required annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we determined that no impairment existed as the estimated fair value of our reporting units was in excess of their carrying value.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P44_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a non-amortizable intangible asset impairment of $98.1 million in our Global Investment Management segment.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	in value of our open-end funds, primarily in Europe.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded a non-amortizable intangible asset impairment of $19.8 million in our EMEA segment related to the discontinuation of the use of a trade name in the United Kingdom.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P45_S2	See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with the Accounting for Income Taxes , Topic of the FASB ASC, or Topic 740.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P47_S2	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	Accounting for tax positions requires judgments, including estimating reserves for potential uncertainties.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	We also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P49_S2	We do not record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that we believe will be realized in future periods.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P49_S3	While we believe the resulting tax balances as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with Topic 740, as applicable, the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P49_S4	See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information regarding income taxes.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	Our foreign subsidiaries have accumulated $1.3 billion of undistributed earnings for which we have not recorded a deferred tax liability.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	Although tax liabilities might result from dividends being paid out of these earnings, or as a result of a sale or liquidation of non-U.S. subsidiaries, these earnings are permanently reinvested outside of the United States and we do not have any plans to repatriate them or to sell or liquidate any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P50_S2	To the extent that we are able to repatriate earnings in a tax efficient manner, or in the event of a change in our capital situation or investment strategy in which such funds become needed for funding our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds, net of foreign tax credits.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P50_S3	Determining our tax liability upon repatriation is not practicable.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P50_S4	Cash and cash equivalents owned by non-U.S. subsidiaries totaled $287.4 million at December 31, 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P50_S5	In 2012 and 2013, we repatriated $58.0 million and $196.2 million, respectively.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P50_S6	In anticipation of these repatriations, tax benefits of $28.8 million were recorded in 2012.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P50_S7	Additional tax benefits associated with the release of valuation allowances of $14.5 million and $4.9 million were recorded in 2013 and 2014, respectively.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	The following table sets forth items derived from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012:
1138118_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	EBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, while amounts shown for EBITDA, as adjusted, remove the impact of certain cash and non-cash charges related to acquisitions and cost containment expenses, as well as certain carried interest incentive compensation (reversal) expense.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P52_S1	Our management believes that both of these measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculations of EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, generally eliminate the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	As a result, our management uses these measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes, including as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive programs.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P53_S1	Additionally, we believe EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, are useful to investors to assist them in getting a more complete picture of our results of operations.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P53_S2	However, EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, are not recognized measurements under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and when analyzing our operating performance, readers should use EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P53_S3	Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P53_S4	Furthermore, EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for our management s discretionary use, as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P53_S5	The amounts shown for EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P53_S6	EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted for selected charges are calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013 We reported consolidated net income of $484.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 on revenue of $9.0 billion as compared to consolidated net income of $316.5 million on revenue of $7.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P54_S1	Our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $1.9 billion, or 26.0%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P54_S2	This increase was in part due to contributions from the Norland Acquisition.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P54_S3	However, the revenue increase also reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher worldwide property, facilities and project management fees (excluding the impact of the Norland Acquisition, up 15.8%), increased sales (up 19.7%) and leasing (up 16.2%) activity.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	Foreign currency translation had a $53.5 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily driven by weakness in the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, Canadian dollar, Indian rupee and Japanese yen, partially offset by strength in the British pound sterling, during the year ended December 31, 2014 versus the year ended December 31, 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P55_S1	Our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by $1.4 billion, or 33.9%, during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P55_S2	This increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our global property and facilities management businesses, particularly due to the Norland Acquisition.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P55_S3	In addition, as previously mentioned, our sales professionals generally are paid on a commission basis, which substantially correlates with our transaction revenue performance.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P55_S4	Accordingly, the increase in sales and lease transaction revenue led to a corresponding increase in commission accruals.

1138118_15_ITEM7_P56_S2	Excluding activity associated with Norland, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 59.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 58.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P56_S3	Our operating, administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis increased by $334.7 million, or 15.9%, during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P56_S4	The increase was partly driven by costs associated with the Norland Acquisition.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P56_S5	Also contributing to the variance were higher worldwide payroll-related costs (including bonuses), increased consulting costs, and an asset impairment charge of $8.6 million incurred in our Americas segment during the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P56_S6	Foreign currency translation had a $14.2 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2014.

1138118_15_ITEM7_P56_S10	This increase was primarily attributable to higher amortization expense relative to intangibles acquired in the Norland Acquisition and in-fill acquisitions completed in 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P56_S11	A rise in depreciation expense during the year ended December 31, 2014 driven by technology-related capital expenditures also contributed to the increase.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P56_S12	Our non-amortizable intangible asset impairment on a consolidated basis was $98.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, which represented non-cash write-offs related to a decrease in value of our open-end funds in our Global Investment Management segment, primarily in Europe.

1138118_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	The increase over the prior-year period is largely due to our adoption of Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity effective January 1, 2014 and as a result, no longer reporting discontinued operations in the ordinary course of our business.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P57_S2	Prior to January 1, 2014, if in the ordinary course of business we disposed of real estate assets, or held real estate assets for sale, that were considered components of an entity in accordance with Topic 360, and if we did not have, or expect to have, significant continuing involvement with the operation of these real estate assets after disposition, we were required to recognize operating profits or losses and gains or losses on disposition of these assets as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations in the periods in which they occurred.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P57_S3	Our equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis increased by $37.3 million, or 57.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P57_S4	This increase was primarily driven by higher equity earnings associated with gains on property sales within our Development Services segment and a gain on the sale of an equity investment in Canada within our Americas segment during the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P57_S5	Our other income on a consolidated basis was relatively consistent at $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.

1138118_15_ITEM7_P57_S8	During the latter part of 2014, we completed three financing transactions, including the issuance in September 2014 and December 2014 of $300.0 million and $125.0 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due March 15, 2025 and the redemption in October 2014 of all of the then outstanding 6.625% senior notes (aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million).
1138118_15_ITEM7_P57_S9	Additionally, in January 2015 we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with more favorable interest rate spreads than under our prior credit agreement.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P57_S10	Our write-off of financing costs on a consolidated basis was $23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $56.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P57_S11	The write-off in 2014 related to costs associated with the redemption in full of our 6.625% senior notes, including a $17.4 million early extinguishment premium and the write-off of $5.7 million of previously deferred financing costs.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P57_S12	The write-off in 2013 primarily related to costs associated with the redemption in full of our 11.625% senior subordinated notes, including a $26.2 million early extinguishment premium and the write-off of $16.1 million of unamortized original issue discount and previously deferred financing costs.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P57_S13	In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2013, we wrote-off $10.4 million of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with a previous credit agreement and incurred fees of $3.6 million in connection with its replacement credit agreement and 5.00% senior notes.

1138118_15_ITEM7_P57_S15	This increase was driven by the significant growth in pre-tax income during the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P57_S16	Our effective tax rate from continuing operations, after adjusting pre-tax income to remove the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, decreased to 35.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 37.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P57_S17	This decrease was largely due to a favorable change in our mix, with 71% of our earnings, after removing the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, from the United States in 2013 as compared to 68% in 2014, partially due to the Norland Acquisition.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P57_S18	Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2014, we reversed accrued taxes, interest and penalties related to settled positions, which had a positive impact on the current year effective tax rate.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P57_S19	These favorable items were partially offset by a reduction in foreign income tax credit benefits.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	Our consolidated income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, was $27.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	This income was reported in our Development Services and Global Investment Management segments and mostly related to gains from property sales, which were largely attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	As previously mentioned, on January 1, 2014, we adopted ASU 2014-08 and as a result, no longer anticipate reporting discontinued operations in the ordinary course of our business.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P59_S1	Our net income attributable to non-controlling interests on a consolidated basis was $29.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $32.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.

1138118_15_ITEM7_P59_S4	Our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by $670.7 million, or 10.3%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P59_S5	This increase was primarily driven by higher worldwide sales (up 23.9%), property, facilities and project management (up 11.3%) and leasing (up 8.6%) activity.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P59_S6	Carried interest revenue earned in our Global Investment Management segment also contributed to the positive variance.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P59_S7	These items were partially offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $73.4 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P59_S8	The negative impact of foreign currency was primarily driven by weakness in the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Indian rupee and Japanese yen, partially offset by strength in the Euro, during the year ended December 31, 2013 versus the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	Our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by $446.9 million, or 11.9%, during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012.

1138118_15_ITEM7_P60_S2	Accordingly, the increase in sales and lease transaction revenue led to a corresponding increase in commission accruals.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P60_S3	The increase in cost of services was also due to higher salaries and related costs associated with our global property, facilities and project management contracts as well as higher bonuses in the United States and the United Kingdom due to increased headcount and improved operating performance.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P60_S4	Foreign currency translation had a $41.9 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended December 31, 2013.

1138118_15_ITEM7_P60_S6	In addition, higher producer recruitment costs during the year ended December 31, 2013 increased this ratio.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P60_S7	Our operating, administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis increased by $101.4 million, or 5.1%, during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012.

1138118_15_ITEM7_P60_S9	These increases were partially offset by $32.3 million of impairment charges incurred during the year ended December 31, 2012 that did not recur during the year ended December 31, 2013 and $25.1 million of lower transaction and integration costs attributable to acquisitions.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P60_S10	Foreign currency translation had an $18.4 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2013.

1138118_15_ITEM7_P60_S12	Excluding such costs, operating expenses were 29.1% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013 versus 29.6% for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	ended December 31, 2013 was achieved despite incremental investments in our operating platform, and outside insurance costs, reflecting the operating leverage inherent in our business and proactive cost savings initiatives.

1138118_15_ITEM7_P61_S2	An increase in depreciation expense during the year ended December 31, 2013 driven by technology-related capital expenditures and an increase in amortization expense related to mortgage servicing rights during the year ended December 31, 2013, were partially mitigated by $9.6 million of intangible amortization expense related to ING REIM incentive fees in the year ended December 31, 2012, which did not recur during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P61_S3	Our non-amortizable intangible asset impairment on a consolidated basis was $98.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to $19.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.

1138118_15_ITEM7_P61_S10	This activity was partially offset by the impact of $4.3 million of income associated with the sale of a cost method investment in our EMEA segment, which did not recur during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P61_S11	Our consolidated interest income was $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.

1138118_15_ITEM7_P68_S3	Higher payroll-related costs (including bonuses), which resulted from improved operating performance, as well as increased consulting costs, also contributed to the increase for the year ended December, 31, 2014.

1138118_15_ITEM7_P69_S1	Contributions from the acquisition of our former affiliate company in Thailand in June 2014 also added to the increase during the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P69_S2	The increase was partially offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $43.7 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily driven by weakness in the Australian dollar, Japanese yen and Indian rupee when converting to U.S. dollars during the year ended December 31, 2014 versus the year ended December 31, 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P69_S3	Cost of services increased by $50.2 million, or 9.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, driven by increased commission expense resulting from higher sales and lease transaction revenue as well as a concentration of commissions among higher producing professionals in Australia and Japan.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P69_S4	Higher salaries and related costs associated with our property and facilities management contracts also contributed to an increase in cost of services during the year ended December 31, 2014.

1138118_15_ITEM7_P69_S11	Lower asset management fees, which reflect the sale of assets in 2013 to harvest gains for fund investors (which generated the carried interest in 2013), lower fees on some AUM in EMEA, and our exiting the management of a private REIT, also contributed to the decline during the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P69_S12	These reductions were partially offset by higher acquisitions fees during the year ended December 31, 2014 as well as foreign currency translation, which had a $4.5 million positive impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P69_S13	Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $21.6 million, or 6.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to higher carried interest expense incurred in the current year.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P69_S14	Foreign currency translation also had a $2.7 million negative impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P69_S15	These increases were partially offset by lower costs due to the sale of assets and internalization of the management of the private REIT discussed above.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	This business transitioned from gain-harvesting in 2013 to capital-deployment in 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P70_S1	Total AUM as of December 31, 2014 rose to $90.6 billion.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P70_S2	A rollforward of our AUM by product type for the year ended December 31, 2014 is as follows (dollars in billions):
1138118_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	AUM generally refers to the properties and other assets with respect to which we provide (or participate in) oversight, investment management services and other advice, and which generally consist of real estate properties or loans, securities portfolios and investments in operating companies and joint ventures.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P71_S1	Our AUM is intended principally to reflect the extent of our presence in the real estate market, not the basis for determining our management fees.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P71_S2	Our material assets under management consist of:
1138118_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	a) the total fair market value of the real estate properties and other assets either wholly-owned or held by joint ventures and other entities in which our sponsored funds or investment vehicles and client accounts have invested or to which they have provided financing.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P72_S1	Committed (but unfunded) capital from investors in our sponsored funds is not included in this component of our AUM.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P72_S2	The value of development properties is included at estimated completion cost.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	b) the net asset value of our managed securities portfolios, including investments (which may be comprised of committed but uncalled capital) in private real estate funds under our fund of funds program.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P73_S1	Our calculation of AUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	Development Services Revenue increased by $11.9 million, or 22.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to higher development fees during the year ended December 31, 2014 due to an increase in new projects started.

1138118_15_ITEM7_P76_S0	The pullback in multi-housing lending from Government-Sponsored Entities, or GSEs, had an adverse impact on our performance, particularly in the second half of 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P77_S0	Foreign currency translation had a $20.7 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily driven by weakness in the Brazilian real and Canadian dollar when converting to U.S. dollars during the year ended December 31, 2013 versus the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P77_S1	Cost of services increased by $304.1 million, or 11.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to increased commission expense resulting from higher sales and lease transaction revenue.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P77_S2	Also contributing to the variance was higher salaries and related costs associated with our property, facilities and project management contracts and higher bonuses due to increased headcount and improved operating performance.

1138118_15_ITEM7_P77_S5	Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $78.6 million, or 8.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P77_S6	The increase was primarily driven by strategic investments made during the year ended December 31, 2013, including increased headcount, as well as higher insurance, legal, consulting, marketing and travel costs.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P77_S7	Foreign currency translation had a $6.0 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2013.

1138118_15_ITEM7_P77_S9	The increase was broad based, as every major business line showed growth, led by property sales and property, facilities and project management.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P77_S10	Notable strength was evident in France, Spain and the United Kingdom.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P77_S11	Foreign currency translation had a $9.5 million positive impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily driven by strength in the Euro, partially offset by weakness in the British pound sterling, when converting to U.S. dollars during the year ended December 31, 2013 versus the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P77_S12	Cost of services increased by $97.0 million, or 15.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily due to an increase in bonuses in the United Kingdom due to improved operating performance.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P77_S13	Higher salaries and related costs associated with our property, facilities and project management contracts and higher payroll-related costs due to increased headcount also contributed to the variance.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P77_S14	Foreign currency translation had a $6.2 million negative impact on cost of services during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P77_S15	Cost of services as a percentage of revenue decreased to 59.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013 from 60.5% for the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily driven by an increase in transaction revenue in certain countries that have a significant fixed compensation structure.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P77_S16	Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $66.5 million, or 18.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P77_S17	The increase was primarily driven by higher payroll-related costs, which resulted from increased headcount and improved operating performance, as well as an increase in insurance, marketing and travel costs.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P77_S18	Also contributing to the increase were higher transaction and integration costs related to acquisitions, primarily associated with the acquisition of Norland.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P78_S0	Foreign currency translation had a $2.8 million negative impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P78_S1	Asia Pacific Revenue increased by $55.6 million, or 6.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P79_S0	Australia, China, India and Japan, was partially muted by foreign currency translation, which had a $63.9 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily driven by weakness in the Australian dollar, Japanese yen and Indian rupee when converting to U.S. dollars during the year ended December 31, 2013 versus the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	Cost of services increased by $45.8 million, or 9.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012, driven by increased commission expense resulting from higher sales transaction revenue and higher payroll-related costs due to increased headcount.

1138118_15_ITEM7_P80_S4	Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $20.7 million, or 9.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012.

1138118_15_ITEM7_P80_S10	This decrease was primarily driven by $36.9 million of lower transaction and integration costs associated with the REIM Acquisitions incurred during the year ended December 31, 2013 as well as the impact of $9.3 million of impairment charges incurred during the year ended December 31, 2012, which did not recur during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P80_S11	These items were partially offset by higher bonuses, which resulted from improved operating performance during the year ended December 31, 2013.

1138118_15_ITEM7_P80_S14	A rollforward of our AUM by product type for the year ended December 31, 2013 is as follows (dollars in billions):
1138118_15_ITEM7_P81_S0	Development Services Revenue decreased by $25.6 million, or 32.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily attributable to lower rental revenue as a result of property dispositions.

1138118_15_ITEM7_P81_S2	This decrease was primarily driven by the impact of a $17.2 million impairment charge related to real estate assets incurred during the year ended December 31, 2012, which did not recur during the year ended December 31, 2013, as well as lower property operating expenses as a result of the property dispositions noted above in this segment s revenue discussion.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P82_S0	As of December 31, 2013, development projects in process totaled $4.9 billion, up 16.7% from year-end 2012.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P82_S1	The inventory of pipeline deals totaled $1.5 billion, down 28.6% from year-end 2012.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that we can satisfy our working capital requirements and funding of investments with internally generated cash flow and, as necessary, borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P83_S1	Our expected capital requirements for 2015 include up to approximately $180 million of anticipated net capital expenditures.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P83_S2	As of December 31, 2014, we had committed to fund $25.5 million of additional capital to unconsolidated subsidiaries within our Development Services business, which we may be required to fund at any time.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P83_S3	Additionally, as of December 31, 2014, we had aggregate commitments of $19.0 million to fund future co-investments in our Global Investment Management business, $12.7 million of which is expected to be funded in 2015.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P83_S4	In December 2013, we fortified our real estate outsourcing platform in Europe with the acquisition of Norland for approximately $474 million, which was financed with cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P83_S5	We also completed three financing transactions in recent years.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P83_S6	These occurred in March 2013, September 2014 and December 2014, respectively, where we took advantage of market conditions to refinance our debt.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P83_S7	In addition, in January 2015, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement providing for a $500 million tranche A term loan facility (in addition to a $2.6 billion revolving credit facility).
1138118_15_ITEM7_P83_S8	We historically have not sought external sources of financing and have relied on our internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital, capital expenditure and investment requirements.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P83_S9	In the absence of extraordinary events, we anticipate that our cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future, but at a minimum for the next 12 months.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P83_S10	From time to time, we may again seek to take advantage of market opportunities to refinance existing debt securities with new debt securities at interest rates, maturities and terms we would deem attractive.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	As evidenced above, from time to time, we consider potential strategic acquisitions.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P84_S1	We believe that any future significant acquisitions that we may make could require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P84_S2	In the past, we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that we believed to be reasonable.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P84_S3	However, it is possible that we may not be able to find acquisition financing on favorable terms, or at all, in the future if we decide to make any further material acquisitions.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	Our long-term liquidity needs, other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases, generally are comprised of three elements.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P86_S0	The first is the repayment of the outstanding and anticipated principal amounts of our long-term indebtedness.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P86_S1	We are unable to project with certainty whether our long-term cash flow from operations will be sufficient to repay our long-term debt when it comes due.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P86_S2	If our cash flow is insufficient, then we expect that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P86_S3	We cannot make any assurances that such refinancing or amendments would be available on attractive terms, if at all.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	The second long-term liquidity need is the repayment of obligations under our pension plans in the United Kingdom.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P87_S1	Our subsidiaries based in the United Kingdom maintain two contributory defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in the plans.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P87_S2	With respect to these plans, our historical policy has been to contribute annually, an amount to fund pension cost as actuarially determined and as required by applicable laws and regulations.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P87_S3	Our contributions to these plans are invested and, if these investments do not perform in the future as well as we expect, we will be required to provide additional funding to cover any shortfall.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P87_S4	During 2007, we reached agreements with the active members of these plans to freeze future pension plan benefits.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P87_S5	In return, the active members became eligible to enroll in the CBRE Group Personal Pension plan, a defined contribution plan in the United Kingdom.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P87_S6	The underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans included in pension liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report was $92.9 million and $68.0 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P87_S7	We expect to contribute a total of $6.1 million to fund our pension plans for the year ending December 31, 2015.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	The third long-term liquidity need is the payment of obligations related to acquisitions.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P88_S1	Our acquisition structures often include deferred and/or contingent purchase price payments in future periods that are subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P88_S2	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had accrued for $125.2 million and $86.9 million, respectively, of deferred purchase consideration, which was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P88_S3	Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $661.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $83.3 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P88_S4	This variance was primarily due to an increase in receivables during the year ended December 31, 2014 and greater sales of real estate held for sale and under development during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P88_S5	In addition, higher bonuses, income taxes and commissions paid during the year ended December 31, 2014 also contributed to the decrease.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P88_S6	These items were partially offset by an increase in bonus accruals and improved operating performance during the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P88_S7	Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $745.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $454.0 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P88_S8	This variance was primarily due to a decrease in real estate held for sale and under development and higher bonus accruals during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P88_S9	In addition, improved operating performance and greater collections on receivables during the year ended December 31, 2013 contributed to the variance.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P88_S10	These items were partially offset by higher bonus payments made during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P89_S0	Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $151.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $313.4 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P89_S1	This decrease was primarily driven by greater amounts paid for acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2013 (including the Norland Acquisition) and lower proceeds received from the sale of real estate held for investment during the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P89_S2	Net cash used in investing activities totaled $465.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $267.3 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P89_S3	This variance was primarily driven by greater amounts paid for acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P90_S0	Higher contributions to unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2012, greater distributions from unconsolidated subsidiaries during the year ended December 31, 2013 and a decrease in restricted cash during the year ended December 31, 2013 versus an increase in restricted cash during the year ended December 31, 2012 also mitigated the increase in cash used in investing activities.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P90_S1	Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $232.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $634.2 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P90_S2	This variance was primarily due to our refinancing efforts during the year ended December 31, 2013, including the net repayment of $924.0 million of senior secured term loans and the redemption of $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 11.625% senior subordinated notes, partially offset by the issuance of $800.0 million of 5.00% senior notes.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P90_S3	Proceeds from the issuance of the 5.25% senior notes due in 2025 during the year ended December 31, 2014 and higher net repayments of notes payable on real estate within our Development Services segment and higher distributions to non-controlling interests during the year ended December 31, 2013 also contributed to the variance.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P90_S4	These items were partially offset by the redemption of $350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.625% senior notes in 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P90_S5	Net cash used in financing activities totaled $866.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $765.6 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P90_S6	The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to our refinancing efforts during the year ended December 31, 2013, including the net repayment of $924.0 million of senior secured term loans and the redemption of $450.0 million of 11.625% senior subordinated notes, partially offset by the issuance of $800.0 million of 5.00% senior notes.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P90_S7	In addition, higher net repayments of notes payable on real estate within our Development Services segment and higher distributions to non-controlling interests during the year ended December 31, 2013 also contributed to the increase.

1138118_15_ITEM7_P94_S0	(5) Because these obligations are related, either wholly or partially, to the future retirement of our employees and such retirement dates are not predictable, an undeterminable portion of this amount will be paid in years one through five.

1138118_15_ITEM7_P101_S1	In addition, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or for other purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P101_S2	If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our debt, would increase.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P102_S0	Since 2001, we have maintained credit facilities to fund strategic acquisitions and to provide for our working capital needs.

1138118_15_ITEM7_P109_S1	The purpose of these interest rate swap agreements is to attempt to hedge potential changes to our cash flows due to the variable interest nature of our senior secured term loan facilities.

1138118_15_ITEM7_P123_S3	The remainder, or $200.0 million, has a maturity date of May 27, 2015.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P124_S0	In August 2009, CBRE Capital Markets entered into a funding arrangement with Fannie Mae under its Multifamily As Soon As Pooled Plus Agreement and its Multifamily As Soon As Pooled Sale Agreement, or ASAP Program.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P124_S1	Under the ASAP Program, CBRE Capital Markets may elect, on a transaction by transaction basis, to sell a percentage of certain closed multifamily loans to Fannie Mae on an expedited basis.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P124_S2	After all contingencies are satisfied, the ASAP Program requires that CBRE Capital Markets repurchase the interest in the multifamily loan previously sold to Fannie Mae followed by either a full delivery back to Fannie Mae via whole loan execution or a securitization into a mortgage backed security.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P124_S3	Under this agreement, the maximum outstanding balance under the ASAP Program cannot exceed $200.0 million and, between the sale date to Fannie Mae and the repurchase date by CBRE Capital Markets, the outstanding balance bears interest and is payable to Fannie Mae at the daily one-month LIBOR plus 1.35% with a LIBOR floor of 0.35%.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P124_S4	This arrangement remains in place but is cancelable at any time by Fannie Mae with notice.

1138118_15_ITEM7_P128_S3	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had $501.2 million and $374.6 million, respectively, of warehouse lines of credit principal outstanding, which were included in short-term borrowings in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P129_S0	$506.3 million and $381.5 million of mortgage loans held for sale (warehouse receivables), as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which substantially represented mortgage loans funded through the lines of credit that, while committed to be purchased, had not yet been purchased and which were also included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P130_S0	Our subsidiaries based in the United Kingdom maintain two contributory defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in the plans.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P130_S1	The underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans included in pension liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report was $92.9 million and $68.0 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P130_S2	We expect to contribute a total of $6.1 million to fund our pension plans for the year ending December 31, 2015.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P131_S0	In January 2008, CBRE Multifamily Capital, Inc., or CBRE MCI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBRE Capital Markets, entered into an agreement with Fannie Mae, under Fannie Mae s Delegated Underwriting and Servicing Lender Program, or DUS Program, to provide financing for multifamily housing with five or more units.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P131_S1	Under the DUS Program, CBRE MCI originates, underwrites, closes and services loans without prior approval by Fannie Mae, and in selected cases, is subject to sharing up to one-third of any losses on loans originated under the DUS Program.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P131_S2	CBRE MCI has funded loans subject to such loss sharing arrangements with unpaid principal balances of $9.7 billion at December 31, 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P131_S3	Additionally, CBRE MCI has funded loans under the DUS Program that are not subject to loss sharing arrangements with unpaid principal balances of approximately $293.7 million at December 31, 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P132_S0	CBRE MCI, under its agreement with Fannie Mae, must post cash reserves or other acceptable collateral under formulas established by Fannie Mae to provide for sufficient capital in the event losses occur.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P132_S1	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, CBRE MCI had a $29.0 million letter of credit and $16.6 million of cash deposited, respectively, under this reserve arrangement, and had provided approximately $16.8 million and $13.8 million, respectively, of loan loss accruals.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P132_S2	Fannie Mae s recourse under the DUS Program is limited to the assets of CBRE MCI, which totaled approximately $310.2 million (including $165.9 million of warehouse receivables, a substantial majority of which are pledged against warehouse lines of credit and are therefore not available to Fannie Mae) at December 31, 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P132_S3	We had outstanding letters of credit totaling $40.9 million as of December 31, 2014, excluding letters of credit for which we have outstanding liabilities already accrued on our consolidated balance sheet related to our subsidiaries outstanding reserves for claims under certain insurance programs as well as letters of credit related to operating leases.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P132_S4	CBRE MCI s letter of credit totaling $29.0 million referred to in the preceding paragraph represented the majority of the $40.9 million outstanding letters of credit.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P132_S5	The remaining letters of credit are primarily executed by us in the ordinary course of business and expire at varying dates through December 2015.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P132_S6	We had guarantees totaling $13.8 million as of December 31, 2014, excluding guarantees related to pension liabilities, consolidated indebtedness and other obligations for which we have outstanding liabilities already accrued on our consolidated balance sheet, and operating leases.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P132_S7	The $13.8 million mainly represents guarantees of obligations of unconsolidated subsidiaries, which expire at varying dates through December 2018, as well as various guarantees of management contracts in our operations overseas, which expire at the end of each of the respective agreements.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P132_S8	In addition, as of December 31, 2014, we had numerous completion and budget guarantees relating to development projects.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P132_S9	These guarantees are made by us in the ordinary course of our Development Services business.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P132_S10	Each of these guarantees requires us to complete construction of the relevant project within a specified timeframe and/or within a specified budget, with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P133_S0	general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P133_S1	These contracts are intended to pass the risk to such contractors.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P133_S2	While there can be no assurance, we do not expect to incur any material losses under these guarantees.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P134_S0	An important part of the strategy for our Global Investment Management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P134_S1	These co-investments typically range from 2.0% to 5.0% of the equity in a particular fund.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P134_S2	As of December 31, 2014, we had aggregate commitments of $19.0 million to fund future co-investments, $12.7 million of which is expected to be funded in 2015.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P134_S3	In addition to required future capital contributions, some of the co-investment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets and the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P134_S4	Additionally, an important part of our Development Services business strategy is to invest in unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries as a principal (in most cases co-investing with our clients).
1138118_15_ITEM7_P134_S5	As of December 31, 2014, we had committed to fund $25.5 million of additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries, which we may be required to fund at any time.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P135_S0	Seasonality A significant portion of our revenue is seasonal, which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P136_S0	Historically, our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flow from operating activities tend to be lowest in the first quarter, and highest in the fourth quarter of each year.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P136_S1	Earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth quarter due to the focus on completing sales, financing and leasing transactions prior to calendar year-end.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P137_S0	Inflation Our commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by real estate market supply and demand, which may be affected by general economic conditions including inflation.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P137_S1	However, to date, we do not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon our operations.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P138_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).
1138118_15_ITEM7_P138_S1	This ASU requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P138_S2	The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, when it becomes effective on January 1, 2017.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P138_S3	This ASU permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P139_S0	We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P139_S1	We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of this ASU on our ongoing financial reporting.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P140_S0	In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P140_S1	This ASU provides consolidation guidance for legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations and securitization structures.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P140_S2	This ASU offers updated consolidation evaluation criteria and may require additional disclosure requirements.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P140_S3	ASU 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016.
1138118_15_ITEM7_P140_S4	We do not believe the adoption of this update will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or disclosure requirements of our consolidated financial statements.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	consists of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations and changes in interest rates on debt obligations.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We manage such risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of our debt funding and by using derivative financial instruments.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We apply the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) (Topic 815) when accounting for derivative financial instruments.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	In all cases, we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and, accordingly, do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Exchange Rates Certain of our foreign operations expose us to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P2_S1	These fluctuations may impact the value of our cash receipts and payments in terms of our functional currency.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P3_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately 44% of our business was transacted in local currencies of foreign countries, the majority of which includes the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Euro, Indian rupee, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We enter into derivative financial instruments to attempt to protect the value or fix the amount of certain obligations in terms of our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P4_S1	In March 2014, we began a foreign currency exchange forward hedging program by entering into 38 foreign currency exchange forward contracts, including agreements to buy U.S. dollars and sell Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, Japanese yen, Euros, and British pound sterling covering an initial notional amount of $209.7 million.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The purpose of these forward contracts is to attempt to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that would adversely impact some of our foreign currency denominated EBITDA.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P4_S3	Hedge accounting was not elected for any of these contracts.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P4_S4	As such, changes in the fair values of these contracts are recorded directly in earnings.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Included in the consolidated statement of operations set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report were net gains of $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 resulting from net gains on foreign currency exchange forward contracts.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P5_S1	As of December 31, 2014, we had 52 foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding covering a notional amount of $302.0 million.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P5_S2	As of December 31, 2014, the fair value of forward contracts with two counterparties aggregated to a $0.5 million asset position, which was included in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P5_S3	As of December 31, 2014, the fair value of forward contracts with four counterparties aggregated to a $1.3 million liability position, which was included in other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P6_S0	We also routinely monitor our exposure to currency exchange rate changes in connection with certain transactions and sometimes enter into foreign currency exchange option and forward contracts to limit our exposure to such transactions, as appropriate.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P6_S1	In the normal course of business, we also sometimes utilize derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange contracts to attempt to mitigate foreign currency exchange exposure resulting from intercompany loans.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Included in the consolidated statements of operations set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report were net gains of $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and net losses of $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, resulting from net gains/losses on foreign currency exchange option and forward contracts.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P7_S1	As of December 31, 2014, the fair value of such contracts with one counterparty aggregated to a $0.8 million asset position, which was included in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P7_S2	As of December 31, 2014, the fair value of forward contracts with one counterparty aggregated to a $0.1 million liability position, which was included in other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Interest Rates We manage our interest expense by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P8_S1	Excluding notes payable on real estate, our fixed and variable rate long-term debt at December 31, 2014 consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P9_S0	(1) Consists of amounts due under our senior secured term loan facilities, including $434.4 million of tranche A term loan facility and $211.2 million of tranche B term loan facility.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P10_S0	(4) Consists of amounts due under our prior revolving credit facility.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P10_S1	We extinguished this balance in full in January 2015.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P11_S0	In March 2011, we entered into five interest rate swap agreements, all with effective dates in October 2011, and immediately designated them as cash flow hedges in accordance with Topic 815.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P11_S1	The purpose of these interest rate swap agreements is to attempt to hedge potential changes to our cash flows due to the variable interest nature of our senior secured term loan facilities.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P11_S2	The total notional amount of these interest rate swap agreements is $400.0 million, with $200.0 million expiring in October 2017 and $200.0 million expiring in September 2019.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P12_S0	There was no significant hedge ineffectiveness for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P12_S1	As of December 31, 2014, the fair value of such interest rate swap agreements were reflected as a $26.9 million liability and were included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P12_S2	The estimated fair value of our senior secured term loans was approximately $645.1 million at December 31, 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P12_S3	Based on dealers quotes, the estimated fair values of our 5.00% senior notes and 5.25% senior notes were $818.0 million and $439.7 million, respectively, at December 31, 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P13_S0	We utilize sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect of our variable rate debt.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P13_S1	If interest rates were to increase by 10.0% on our outstanding variable rate debt, excluding notes payable on real estate, at December 31, 2014, the net impact of the additional interest cost would be a decrease of $2.4 million on pre-tax income and a decrease of $2.4 million on cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P13_S2	We also have $42.8 million of notes payable on real estate as of December 31, 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P13_S3	These notes have interest rates ranging from 2.41% to 10.0% with maturity dates extending through 2023.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P13_S4	Interest costs relating to notes payable on real estate include both interest that is expensed and interest that is capitalized as part of the cost of real estate.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P13_S5	If interest rates were to increase by 10.0%, our total estimated interest cost related to notes payable would increase by approximately $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P13_S6	From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap and cap agreements in order to limit our interest expense related to our notes payable on real estate.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P13_S7	If any of these agreements are not designated as effective hedges, then they are marked to market each period with the change in fair value recognized in current period earnings.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P14_S0	The net impact on our earnings resulting from gains and/or losses on interest rate swap and cap agreements associated with notes payable on real estate has not been significant.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P15_S0	We also enter into loan commitments that relate to the origination of commercial mortgage loans that will be held for resale.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P15_S1	FASB ASC Topic 815 requires that these commitments be recorded at their fair values as derivatives.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P15_S2	Included in the consolidated statements of operations set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report were net gains of $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, resulting from gains on these loan commitments.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P15_S3	As of December 31, 2014, the fair value of such contracts with three counterparties aggregated to a $2.4 million asset position, which was included in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_15_ITEM7A_P16_S0	The net impact on our financial position and earnings resulting from loan commitments for years prior to 2014 was not significant.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	All other schedules are omitted because they are either not applicable, not required or the information required is included in the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes thereto.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P1_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders CBRE Group, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CBRE Group, Inc. (the Company) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P1_S1	In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the related financial statement schedules.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P1_S2	We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1138118_15_ITEM8_P1_S3	The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting .
1138118_15_ITEM8_P1_S4	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P1_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1138118_15_ITEM8_P1_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P1_S7	Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P1_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P1_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P1_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P2_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P2_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P2_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P2_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of CBRE Group, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P4_S0	present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P4_S1	Also in our opinion, CBRE Group, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

1138118_15_ITEM8_P10_S0	Nature of Operations CBRE Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (which may be referred to in these financial statements as the company , we , us and our ), was incorporated on February 20, 2001.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P10_S1	We are the world s largest commercial real estate services and investment firm, based on 2014 revenue, with leading full-service operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P10_S2	We offer a full range of services to occupiers, owners, lenders and investors in office, retail, industrial, multifamily and other types of commercial real estate.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P10_S3	As of December 31, 2014, excluding independent affiliates, we operated in over 370 offices worldwide, with more than 52,000 employees providing commercial real estate services under the CBRE brand name, investment management services under the CBRE Global Investors brand name and development services under the Trammell Crow brand name.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P10_S4	Our business is focused on several competencies, including commercial property and corporate facilities management, tenant/occupier and property/agency leasing, capital markets solutions (property sales, commercial mortgage origination and servicing, and debt/structured finance), real estate investment management, valuation, development services and proprietary research.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P10_S5	We generate revenue from management fees on a contractual and per-project basis, and from commissions on transactions.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P10_S6	Our contractual, fee-for-services businesses, which generally involve property and facilities management, mortgage loan servicing and investment management, represented approximately 46% of our 2014 revenue.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P10_S7	In addition, our appraisal/valuation and leasing services have contractual elements and work for clients in these service lines is often recurring in nature.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P11_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majority-owned subsidiaries, as well as variable interest entities (VIEs) in which we are the primary beneficiary and other subsidiaries of which we have control.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P11_S1	The equity attributable to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries is shown separately in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P11_S2	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P12_S0	Variable Interest Entities As required by the Consolidations Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) (Topic 810), we consolidate all VIEs in which we are the entity s primary beneficiary.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P12_S1	A reporting entity is determined to be the primary beneficiary if it holds a controlling financial interest in the VIE.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P12_S2	(2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from such entity that could potentially be significant to such entity.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P12_S3	The entity which satisfies these criteria is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P13_S0	We determine if an entity is a VIE based on several factors, including whether the entity s total equity investment at risk upon inception is sufficient to finance the entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P13_S1	We make judgments regarding the sufficiency of the equity at risk based first on a qualitative analysis, then a quantitative analysis, if necessary.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P14_S0	We analyze any investments in VIEs to determine if we are the primary beneficiary.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P14_S1	We consider a variety of factors in identifying the entity that holds the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance including, but not limited to, the ability to direct financing, leasing, construction and other operating decisions and activities.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P14_S2	In addition, we consider the rights of other investors to participate in those decisions, to replace the manager and to sell or liquidate the entity.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P15_S0	We also have several co-investments in real estate investment funds which qualify for a deferral of the qualitative approach for analyzing potential VIEs.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P15_S1	We continue to analyze these investments under the former quantitative method incorporating various estimates, including estimated future cash flows, asset hold periods and discount rates, as well as estimates of the probabilities of various scenarios occurring.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P16_S0	If the entity is a VIE, we then determine whether we consolidate the entity as the primary beneficiary.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P16_S1	This determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary includes any impact of an upside economic interest in the form of a promote that we may have.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P17_S0	A promote is an interest built into the distribution structure of the entity based on the entity s achievement of certain return hurdles.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P17_S1	We consolidate any VIE of which we are the primary beneficiary (see Note 3) and disclose significant VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary, if any, as well as disclose our maximum exposure to loss related to VIEs that are not consolidated.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P17_S2	We determine whether an entity is a VIE and, if so, whether it should be consolidated by utilizing judgments and estimates that are inherently subjective.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P17_S3	If an entity is not a VIE, our determination of the appropriate accounting method with respect to our investments in limited partnerships, limited liability companies and other subsidiaries is based on voting control.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P17_S4	For our general partner interests, we are presumed to control (and therefore consolidate) the entity, unless the other limited partners have substantive rights that overcome this presumption of control.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P17_S5	These substantive rights allow the limited partners to remove the general partner with or without cause or to participate in significant decisions made in the ordinary course of the entity s business.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P17_S6	We account for our non-controlling general partner investments in these entities under the equity method.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P17_S7	This treatment also applies to our managing member interests in limited liability companies.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P17_S8	Other Investments Our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, but do not control, or entities which are variable interest entities in which we are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for under the equity method.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P17_S9	Accordingly, our share of the earnings from these equity-method basis companies is included in consolidated net income.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P17_S10	All other investments held on a long-term basis are valued at cost less any impairment in value.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P17_S11	Our determination of the appropriate accounting method for all other investments in subsidiaries is based on the amount of influence we have (including our ownership interest) in the underlying entity.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P17_S12	Those other investments where we have the ability to exercise significant influence (but not control) over operating and financial policies of such subsidiaries (including certain subsidiaries where we have less than 20% ownership) are accounted for using the equity method.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P17_S13	We eliminate transactions with such equity method subsidiaries to the extent of our ownership in such subsidiaries.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P17_S14	Accordingly, our share of the earnings or losses of these equity method subsidiaries is included in consolidated net income.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P17_S15	All of our remaining investments are carried at cost.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P18_S0	Under either the equity or cost method, impairment losses are recognized upon evidence of other-than-temporary losses of value.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P19_S0	When testing for impairment on investments that are not actively traded on a public market, we generally use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our investments and/or look to comparable activities in the marketplace.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P19_S1	Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow approach.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P20_S0	return, discount and capitalization rates, interest rates and financing terms, rental rates, timing of leasing activity, estimates of lease terms and related concessions, etc.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P20_S1	When determining if impairment is other-than-temporary, we also look to the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been less than cost as well as the financial condition and near-term prospects of each investment.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P21_S0	Estimates, Risks and Uncertainties Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.), or GAAP, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P21_S1	These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses we report.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P21_S2	Such estimates include the value of goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets, accounts receivable, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, retirement and other post-employment benefits, among others.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P21_S3	These estimates and assumptions are based on management s best judgment, and are evaluated on an ongoing basis and adjusted, as needed, using historical experience and other factors, including consideration of the macroeconomic environment.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P21_S4	As future events and their effects cannot be forecast with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P21_S5	Changes in those estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P22_S0	The fair value of our goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets is impacted by economic and capital market conditions as well as our stock price.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P22_S1	Property sales and leasing activity is affected by economic and employment growth, capital markets liquidity, credit availability and pricing, business and investor confidence, and inflation levels.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P22_S2	Adverse trends involving any or all of these factors could reduce transaction-based revenue as well as property values and sales and leasing volume.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P22_S3	Such adverse economic conditions could cause declines in the estimated future discounted cash flows expected for our reporting units.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P22_S4	A major or sustained decline in our future cash flows and/or the current economic conditions could result in impairment charges.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P22_S5	The recoverability of our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries is impacted by general conditions in the global economy and commercial real estate market.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P23_S0	Transaction activity has improved, to varying degrees and at a different pace in various regions around the world, over the past five years.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P23_S1	Property values also have broadly rebounded, as underlying market fundamentals have improved and capital flows into commercial real estate have improved.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P23_S2	The assumptions utilized in our recoverability analysis reflect our belief that the recovery will continue, but that a return to capital markets turmoil and negative economic growth could result in impairment charges.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P24_S0	The recoverability of the carrying value of our investments in real estate is impacted by general conditions in the global economy and commercial real estate market.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P24_S1	Market fundamentals in the primary property types that we develop or own have improved, to varying degrees and at a different pace in various regions globally, over the past five years.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P24_S2	Property sales have increased significantly, buoyed by improved market fundamentals, low interest rates and increased capital flows into commercial real estate.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P24_S3	However, if conditions in the broader economy, capital markets, local, regional or global commercial real estate markets decline sharply once again, we may be required to record impairment charges.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P25_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents generally consist of cash and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of less than three months.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P26_S0	and other entities, which are not available for general corporate use.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P26_S1	We also manage certain cash and cash equivalents as an agent for our investment and property and facilities management clients.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P26_S2	These amounts are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets (see Note 18).
1138118_15_ITEM8_P27_S0	Restricted Cash Included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 is restricted cash of $28.1 million and $61.2 million, respectively.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P27_S1	The balances primarily include restricted cash set aside to cover funding obligations as required by contracts executed by us in the normal course of business.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P28_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist principally of trade receivables and interest-bearing investments.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P28_S1	Users of real estate services account for a substantial portion of trade receivables and collateral is generally not required.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P28_S2	The risk associated with this concentration is limited due to the large number of users and their geographic dispersion.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P29_S0	We place substantially all of our interest-bearing investments with major financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P30_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P30_S1	Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment is computed primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging up to 15 years.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P31_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the term of their associated leases, excluding options to renew, since such leases generally do not carry prohibitive penalties for non-renewal.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P32_S0	We capitalize expenditures that significantly increase the life of our assets and expense the costs of maintenance and repairs.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P32_S1	We review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P32_S2	If this review indicates that such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment is recognized in the period the changes occur and represents the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P33_S0	Certain costs related to the development or purchase of internal-use software are capitalized.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P33_S1	Internal computer software costs that are incurred in the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P33_S2	Direct consulting costs as well as payroll and related costs, which are incurred during the development stage of a project are generally capitalized and amortized over a three-year period (except for enterprise software development platforms, which range from five to ten years) when placed into production.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P34_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting, which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P34_S1	The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P35_S0	Acquisitions) and our acquisition of Norland Managed Services Ltd (Norland) in 2013 (Norland Acquisition).
1138118_15_ITEM8_P35_S1	Other intangible assets that have indefinite estimated useful lives and are not being amortized include certain management contracts identified in the REIM Acquisitions, a trademark, which was separately identified as a result of the 2001 Acquisition, as well as a trade name separately identified as a result of the REIM Acquisitions.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P35_S2	The remaining other intangible assets primarily include customer relationships, loan servicing rights and management contracts, which are all being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging up to 20 years.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P35_S3	We are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P36_S0	The goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step process.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P37_S0	The first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P37_S1	We use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P37_S2	Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P37_S3	These assumptions include revenue growth rates, profit margin percentages, discount rates, etc.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P38_S0	If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered to not be impaired.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P38_S1	If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P39_S0	The second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P39_S1	The implied fair value of goodwill is determined similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination, by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one, over the estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P39_S2	Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business s fair value and the relative size of our goodwill, if different assumptions and estimates were used, it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P40_S0	Deferred Financing Costs Costs incurred in connection with financing activities are generally deferred and amortized over the terms of the related debt agreements ranging up to ten years.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P40_S1	Amortization of these costs is charged to interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P40_S2	Total deferred financing costs, net of accumulated amortization, included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were $35.0 million and $42.3 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P40_S3	During 2014, we completed three financing transactions, which included the issuance in September and December of $300.0 million and $125.0 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due March 15, 2025 and the redemption in October 2014 of all of the then outstanding 6.625% senior notes (aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million).
1138118_15_ITEM8_P40_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2014, in connection with these financing activities, we incurred approximately $4.7 million of financing costs.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P40_S5	In addition, we expensed $5.7 million of previously-deferred financing costs as well as a $17.4 million early extinguishment premium, all of which were included in the write-off of financing costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P40_S6	During 2013, we completed a series of financing transactions, including the amendment and restatement of a prior credit agreement, the issuance of $800.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior notes due March 15, 2023 and the redemption of all of the 11.625% senior subordinated notes totaling $450.0 million.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P40_S7	During the year ended December 31, 2013, in connection with all of these financing activities, we incurred approximately $28.6 million of financing costs, of which $3.6 million was expensed.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P40_S8	In addition, we expensed $17.8 million of previously-deferred financing costs as well as a $26.2 million early extinguishment premium and $8.7 million of unamortized original issue discount associated with the 11.625% senior subordinated notes.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P40_S9	All of these write-offs were included in write-off of financing costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P41_S0	See Note 12 for additional information on activities associated with our debt.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P42_S0	We record commission revenue on real estate sales generally upon close of escrow or transfer of title, except when future contingencies exist.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P42_S1	Real estate commissions on leases are generally recorded in revenue when all obligations under the commission agreement are satisfied.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P43_S0	Terms and conditions of a commission agreement may include, but are not limited to, execution of a signed lease agreement and future contingencies including tenant occupancy, payment of a deposit or payment of a first month s rent (or a combination thereof).
1138118_15_ITEM8_P43_S1	As some of these conditions are outside of our control and are often not clearly defined, judgment must be exercised in determining when such required events have occurred in order to recognize revenue.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P44_S0	A typical commission agreement provides that we earn a portion of a lease commission upon the execution of the lease agreement by the tenant and landlord, with the remaining portion(s) of the lease commission earned at a later date, usually upon tenant occupancy or payment of rent.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P44_S1	The existence of any significant future contingencies results in the delay of recognition of corresponding revenue until such contingencies are satisfied.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P44_S2	For example, if we do not earn all or a portion of the lease commission until the tenant pays its first month s rent, and the lease agreement provides the tenant with a free rent period, we delay revenue recognition until rent is paid by the tenant.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P45_S0	Property and facilities management revenues are generally based upon percentages of the revenue or base rent generated by the entities managed or the square footage managed.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P45_S1	These fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related management agreements.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P46_S0	We account for certain reimbursements (primarily salaries and related charges) mainly related to our property and facilities management operations as revenue.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P46_S1	Reimbursement revenue is recognized when the underlying reimbursable costs are incurred.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P47_S0	Investment management fees are based predominantly upon a percentage of the equity deployed on behalf of our limited partners.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P47_S1	Fees related to our indirect investment management programs are based upon a percentage of the fair value of those investments.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P47_S2	These fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related investment management agreements.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P48_S0	Our Global Investment Management segment earns performance-based incentive fees with regard to many of its investments.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P48_S1	Such revenue is recognized at the end of the measurement periods when the conditions of the applicable incentive fee arrangements have been satisfied and following the expiration of any potential claw back provision.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P48_S2	With many of these investments, our Global Investment Management professionals have participation interests in such incentive fees, which are commonly referred to as carried interest.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P48_S3	This carried interest expense is generally accrued for based upon the probability of such performance-based incentive fees being earned over the related vesting period.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P48_S4	In addition, our Global Investment Management segment also earns success-based transaction fees with regard to buying or selling properties on behalf of certain funds and separate accounts.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P48_S5	Such revenue is recognized at the completion of a successful transaction and is not subject to any claw back provision.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P49_S0	Appraisal fees are recorded after services have been rendered.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P49_S1	and we have no significant remaining obligations for performance in connection with the transaction, while loan servicing fees are recorded in revenue as monthly principal and interest payments are collected from mortgagors.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P49_S2	Other commissions, consulting fees and referral fees are recorded as revenue at the time the related services have been performed, unless significant future contingencies exist.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P50_S0	Development services and project management services generate fees from development and construction management projects.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P50_S1	Most development and construction management and project management assignments are subject to agreements that describe the calculation of fees and when we earn such fees.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P50_S2	The earnings terms of these agreements dictate when we recognize the related revenue.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P50_S3	Generally, development fees are recognized based on the lower of the amount billed or the amount determined on a straight-line basis over the development period.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P51_S0	We may earn incentive fees for project management services based upon achievement of certain performance criteria as set forth in the project management services agreement.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P51_S1	We may earn incentive development fees by reaching specified timetable, leasing, budget or value creation targets, as defined in the relevant development services agreement.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P51_S2	Certain incentive development fees allow us to share in the fair value of the developed real estate asset above cost.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P51_S3	This sharing creates additional revenue potential to us with no exposure to loss other than opportunity cost.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P51_S4	We recognize such fees when the specified target is attained and fees are deemed collectible.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P52_S0	We record deferred income to the extent that cash payments have been received in accordance with the terms of underlying agreements, but such amounts have not yet met the criteria for revenue recognition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P52_S1	We recognize such revenues when the appropriate criteria are met.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P53_S0	In establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables, we make assumptions with respect to future collectability.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P53_S1	Our assumptions are based on an assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends, including the aging of receivables balances.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P53_S2	In addition to these assessments, in general, outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are more than 180 days overdue are evaluated for collectability and fully provided for if deemed uncollectible.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P54_S0	Historically, our credit losses have generally been insignificant.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P54_S1	However, estimating losses requires significant judgment, and conditions may change or new information may become known after any periodic evaluation.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P54_S2	As a result, actual credit losses may differ from our estimates.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P55_S0	Real Estate Classification and Impairment Evaluation We classify real estate in accordance with the criteria of the Property, Plant and Equipment Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 360) as follows: (i) real estate held for sale, which includes completed assets or land for sale in its present condition that meet all of Topic 360 s held for sale criteria, (ii) real estate under development (current), which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of within one year of the balance sheet date; (iii) real estate under development (non-current), which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of more than one year from the balance sheet date; or (iv) real estate held for investment, which consists of land on which development activities have not yet commenced and completed assets or land held for disposition that do not meet the held for sale criteria.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P55_S1	Any asset reclassified from real estate held for sale to real estate under development (current or non-current) or real estate held for investment is recorded individually at the lower of its fair value at the date of the reclassification or its carrying amount before it was classified as held for sale, adjusted (in the case of real estate held for investment) for any depreciation that would have been recognized had the asset been continuously classified as real estate held for investment.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P55_S2	Real estate held for sale is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P55_S3	If an asset s fair value less cost to sell, based on discounted future cash flows, management estimates or market comparisons, is less than its carrying amount, an allowance is recorded against the asset.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P56_S0	Real estate under development and real estate held for investment are carried at cost less depreciation, as applicable.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P56_S1	Buildings and improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, generally up to 39 years.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P56_S2	Tenant improvements included in real estate held for investment are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or terms of the respective leases.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P56_S3	Land improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, up to 15 years.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P56_S4	Real estate under development and real estate held for investment are evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset are less than the asset s carrying amount.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P56_S5	The amount of the impairment loss, if any, is calculated as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value, which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, management estimates or market comparisons.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P57_S0	Cost Capitalization and Allocation When acquiring, developing and constructing real estate assets, we capitalize recoverable costs.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P57_S1	Capitalization begins when the activities related to development have begun and ceases when activities are substantially complete and the asset is available for occupancy.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P57_S2	Recoverable costs capitalized include pursuit costs, or pre-acquisition/pre-construction costs, taxes and insurance, interest, development and construction costs and costs of incidental operations.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P58_S0	We do not capitalize any internal costs when acquiring, developing and constructing real estate assets.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P58_S1	We expense transaction costs for acquisitions that qualify as a business in accordance with the Business Combinations Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 805).
1138118_15_ITEM8_P58_S2	Pursuit costs capitalized in connection with a potential development project that we have determined not to pursue are written off in the period that determination is made.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P59_S0	At times, we purchase bulk land that we intend to sell or develop in phases.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P59_S1	The land basis allocated to each phase is based on the relative estimated fair value of the phases before construction.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P59_S2	We allocate construction costs incurred relating to more than one phase between the various phases; if the costs cannot be specifically attributed to a certain phase or the improvements benefit more than one phase, we allocate the costs between the phases based on their relative estimated sales values, where practicable, or other value methods as appropriate under the circumstances.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P59_S3	Relative allocations of the costs are revised as the sales value estimates are revised.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P60_S0	When acquiring real estate with existing buildings, we allocate the purchase price between land, land improvements, building and intangibles related to in-place leases, if any, based on their relative fair values.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P60_S1	The fair values of acquired land and buildings are determined based on an estimated discounted future cash flow model with lease-up assumptions as if the building was vacant upon acquisition.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P60_S2	The fair value of in-place leases includes the value of lease intangibles for above or below-market rents and tenant origination costs, determined on a lease by lease basis.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P60_S3	The capitalized values for both lease intangibles and tenant origination costs are amortized over the term of the underlying leases.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P60_S4	Amortization related to lease intangibles is recorded as either an increase to or a reduction of rental income and amortization for tenant origination costs is recorded to amortization expense.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P61_S0	Disposition of Real Estate Gains or losses on disposition of real estate are recognized upon sale of the underlying project.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P61_S1	We evaluate each real estate sale transaction to determine if it qualifies for recognition under the full accrual method.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P61_S2	If the transaction does not meet the criteria for the full accrual method of profit recognition based on our assessment, we account for a sale based on an appropriate deferral method determined by the nature and extent of the buyer s investment and our continuing involvement.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P62_S0	Discontinued Operations On January 1, 2014, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, and as a result, no longer anticipate reporting discontinued operations in the ordinary course of our business.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P62_S1	Prior to January 1, 2014, if in the ordinary course of business we disposed of real estate assets, or held real estate assets for sale, that were considered components of an entity in accordance with Topic 360, and if we did not have, or expect to have, significant continuing involvement with the operation of these real estate assets after disposition, we were required to recognize operating profits or losses and gains or losses on disposition of these assets as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations in the periods in which they occurred.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P63_S0	The costs of business promotion and advertising are expensed as incurred.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P63_S1	Business promotion and advertising costs of $55.6 million, $49.4 million and $43.7 million were included in operating, administrative and other expenses for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P64_S0	The financial statements of subsidiaries located outside the U.S. are generally measured using the local currency as the functional currency.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P64_S1	The assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date, and income and expenses are translated at the average monthly rate.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P64_S2	The resulting translation adjustments are included in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of equity.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P64_S3	Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the results of operations.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P64_S4	The aggregate transaction losses included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $7.9 million, $12.6 million and $3.6 million, respectively.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P65_S0	As required by FASB ASC Topic 815 Derivatives and Hedging , we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P65_S1	We do not net derivatives on our balance sheet.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P65_S2	The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P66_S0	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P66_S1	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P66_S2	Derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P67_S0	Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P68_S0	We may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of our risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or we elect not to apply hedge accounting.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P68_S1	In all cases, we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and, accordingly, do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P69_S0	Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive (loss) income.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P69_S1	In the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, accumulated other comprehensive loss consists of foreign currency translation adjustments, amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense, unrealized (losses) gains on interest rate swaps and interest rate caps, unrealized holding (losses) gains on available for sale securities and other pension liability adjustments.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P69_S2	Foreign currency translation adjustments exclude any income tax effect given that earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries are deemed to be reinvested for an indefinite period of time (see Note 15).
1138118_15_ITEM8_P70_S0	Marketable Securities We account for investments in marketable debt and equity securities in accordance with the Investments Debt and Equity Securities Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 320).
1138118_15_ITEM8_P70_S1	We determine the appropriate classification of debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P71_S0	Marketable securities we acquire with the intent to generate a profit from short-term movements in market prices are classified as trading securities.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P71_S1	Debt securities are classified as held to maturity when we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P71_S2	Marketable equity and debt securities not classified as trading or held to maturity are classified as available for sale.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P72_S0	Trading securities are carried at their fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in net income.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P72_S1	Available for sale securities are carried at their fair value and any difference between cost and fair value is recorded as unrealized gain or loss, net of income taxes, and is reported as accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated statement of equity.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P73_S0	Premiums and discounts are recognized in interest using the effective interest method.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P73_S1	Realized gains and losses and declines in value expected to be other-than-temporary on available for sale securities have not been significant.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P74_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P74_S1	Interest and dividends on securities classified as available for sale are included in interest income.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P75_S0	Our wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE Capital Markets is a Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) approved Multifamily Program Plus Seller/Servicer and an approved Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) Aggregation and Negotiated Transaction Seller/Servicer.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P75_S1	In addition, CBRE Capital Markets wholly-owned subsidiary Multifamily Capital is an approved Fannie Mae Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS) Seller/Servicer and CBRE Capital Markets wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE HMF is a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) approved Non-Supervised Federal Housing Authority (FHA) Title II Mortgagee, an approved Multifamily Accelerated Processing (MAP) lender and an approved Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) issuer of mortgage-backed securities (MBS).
1138118_15_ITEM8_P76_S0	Under these arrangements, before loans are originated through proceeds from warehouse lines of credit, we obtain either a contractual loan purchase commitment from either Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae or a confirmed forward trade commitment for the issuance and purchase of a Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae MBS that will be secured by the loans.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P76_S1	The warehouse lines of credit are generally repaid within a one-month period when Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae buys the loans or upon settlement of the Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae MBS, while we retain the servicing rights.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P77_S0	Loans are funded at the prevailing market rates.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P78_S0	We elect the fair value option for all warehouse receivables.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P78_S1	At December 31, 2014 and 2013, all of the warehouse receivables included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were either under commitment to be purchased by Freddie Mac or had confirmed forward trade commitments for the issuance and purchase of Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae mortgage backed securities that will be secured by the underlying loans.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P79_S0	In connection with the origination and sale of mortgage loans with servicing rights retained, we record servicing assets or liabilities based on the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights on the date the loans are sold.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P79_S1	We also assume or purchase certain servicing assets.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P79_S2	Servicing assets are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value in other intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are amortized in proportion to and over the estimated period that net servicing income is expected to be received based on projections and timing of estimated future net cash flows.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P79_S3	Our recording of mortgage servicing rights at their fair value resulted in net gains, which have been reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P79_S4	The amount of mortgage servicing rights recognized during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was as follows (dollars in thousands): Mortgage servicing rights do not actively trade in an open market with readily available observable prices; therefore, fair value is determined based on certain assumptions and judgments, including the estimation of the present value of future cash flows realized from servicing the underlying mortgage loans.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P79_S5	Management s assumptions include the benefits of servicing (servicing fee income and interest on escrow deposits), inflation, the cost of servicing, prepayment rates, delinquencies, discount rate and the estimated life of servicing cash flows.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P79_S6	The assumptions used are subject to change based on management s judgments and estimates of changes in future cash flows and interest rates, among other things.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P79_S7	The key assumptions used during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 in measuring fair value were as follows:
1138118_15_ITEM8_P79_S8	The estimated fair value of our mortgage servicing rights was $245.1 million and $203.6 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P79_S9	We did not incur any impairment charges related to our servicing rights during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 or 2012.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P79_S10	Included in revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations are contractually specified servicing fees from loans serviced for others of $65.2 million, $55.2 million and $40.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and pre-payment fees/late fees/ancillary income earned from loans serviced for others of $6.1 million, $1.9 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P80_S0	Accounting for Broker Draws As part of our recruitment efforts relative to new U.S. brokers, we offer a transitional broker draw arrangement.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P80_S1	Our broker draw arrangements generally last until such time as a broker s pipeline of business is sufficient to allow him or her to earn sustainable commissions.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P81_S0	with a minimal amount of cash flow to allow adequate time for his or her training as well as time for him or her to develop business relationships.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P81_S1	Similar to traditional salaries, the broker draws are paid irrespective of the actual revenues generated by the broker.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P81_S2	Often these broker draws represent the only form of compensation received by the broker.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P81_S3	Furthermore, it is not our general policy to pursue collection of unearned broker draws paid under this arrangement.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P81_S4	As a result, we have concluded that broker draws are economically equivalent to salaries paid and accordingly charge them to compensation as incurred.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P82_S0	The broker is also entitled to earn a commission on completed revenue transactions.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P82_S1	This amount is calculated as the commission that would have been payable under our full commission program, less any amounts previously paid to the broker in the form of a draw.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P83_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We account for all employee awards under the fair value recognition provisions of the Compensation Stock Compensation Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 718).
1138118_15_ITEM8_P83_S1	Topic 718 requires the measurement of compensation cost at the grant date, based upon the estimated fair value of the award, and requires amortization of the related expense over the employee s requisite service period.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P83_S2	See Note 14 for additional information on our stock-based compensation plans.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P84_S0	Basic income per share attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. is computed by dividing net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P84_S1	The computation of diluted income per share attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. generally further assumes the dilutive effect of potential common shares, which include stock options and certain contingently issuable shares.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P84_S2	Contingently issuable shares consist of non-vested stock awards.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P85_S0	Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with the Accounting for Income Taxes Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 740).
1138118_15_ITEM8_P86_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P86_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P86_S2	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P87_S0	Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P88_S0	Self-Insurance Our wholly-owned captive insurance company, which is subject to applicable insurance rules and regulations, insures our exposure related to workers compensation insurance provided to employees and we purchase excess coverage from an unrelated insurance carrier.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P88_S1	We purchase general liability and automotive insurance through an unrelated insurance carrier.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P88_S2	The captive insurance company reinsures the related deductibles.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P88_S3	The captive insurance company also insures deductibles relating to professional indemnity claims.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P88_S4	Given the nature of these types of claims, it may take several years for resolution and determination of the cost of these claims.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P88_S5	We are required to estimate the cost of these claims in our financial statements.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P88_S6	The estimates that we utilize to record our potential losses on claims are inherently subjective, and actual claims could differ from amounts recorded, which could result in increased or decreased expense in future periods.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P89_S0	million and $65.7 million, respectively, which were included in other current and other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P89_S1	Of these amounts, $2.0 million and $2.2 million, respectively, represented our estimated current liabilities as of December 31, 2014 and 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P89_S2	Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Limited Life Subsidiaries As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the estimated settlement value of non-controlling interests in our consolidated limited life subsidiaries was $0.8 million and $5.4 million, respectively, which approximated the carrying value, and which was included in non-controlling interests in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P90_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).
1138118_15_ITEM8_P90_S1	This ASU requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P90_S2	The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP when it becomes effective on January 1, 2017.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P90_S3	This ASU permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P91_S0	We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P91_S1	We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of this ASU on our ongoing financial reporting.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P92_S0	In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P92_S1	This ASU provides consolidation guidance for legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations and securitization structures.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P92_S2	This ASU offers updated consolidation evaluation criteria and may require additional disclosure requirements.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P92_S3	ASU 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P92_S4	We do not believe the adoption of this update will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or disclosure requirements of our consolidated financial statements.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P93_S0	Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2013 and 2012 financial statements to conform with the 2014 presentation.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P94_S0	Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) A consolidated subsidiary (the Venture) in our Global Investment Management segment sponsored investments by third-party investors in certain commercial properties through the formation of tenant-in-common limited liability companies and Delaware Statutory Trusts (collectively referred to as the Entities) that were owned by the third-party investors.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P94_S1	The Venture also formed and was a member of a limited liability company for each property that served as master tenant (Master Tenant).
1138118_15_ITEM8_P94_S2	Each Master Tenant leased the property from the Entities through a master lease agreement.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P94_S3	Pursuant to the master lease agreements, the Master Tenant had the power to direct the day-to-day asset management activities that most significantly impacted the economic performance of the Entities.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P94_S4	As a result, the Entities were deemed to be VIEs since the third-party investors holding the equity investment at risk in the Entities did not direct the day-to-day activities that most significantly impacted the economic performance of the properties held by the Entities.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P94_S5	The Venture made voluntary contributions to each of these properties to support their operations beyond the cash flow generated by the properties themselves and such financial support was significant enough that the Venture was deemed to be the primary beneficiary of each Entity.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P94_S6	As of December 31, 2011, we consolidated three such commercial properties.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P95_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2012, an additional property was consolidated during the first quarter and subsequently sold in the fourth quarter.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P95_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2013, one of the properties was sold, with the remaining two properties sold in the first half of 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P95_S2	No financial support was provided by the Venture to the Entities during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P95_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Venture funded $0.2 million of financial support to the Entities.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P95_S4	The assets of the Entities were the sole collateral for the mortgage notes payable and other liabilities of the Entities and, as such, the creditors and equity investors of these Entities had no recourse to our assets held outside of these Entities.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P95_S5	Investments in real estate of $39.9 million and nonrecourse mortgage notes payable of $41.7 million ($0.9 million of which is current) attributable to the Entities were included in real estate assets held for sale or investment and notes payable on real estate, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P95_S6	In addition, a non-controlling deficit of $1.8 million in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2013 was attributable to the Entities.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P95_S7	Operating results relating to the Entities for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 include the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_15_ITEM8_P96_S0	In connection with our acquisition of CRES, we acquired CRES co-investments from ING in three funds (CRES Funds) for an aggregate purchase price of $58.6 million.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P96_S1	We determined that the CRES Funds were not VIEs and accordingly determined the method of accounting based upon voting control.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P96_S2	The limited partners/members of the CRES Funds lack substantive rights that would overcome our presumption of control.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P96_S3	Accordingly, we began consolidating the CRES Funds as of the acquisition date of July 1, 2011.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P97_S0	In January 2012, one of the Clarion Real Estate Securities (CRES) Funds (CBRE Clarion U.S., L.P.), which we acquired in connection with our acquisition of CRES on July 1, 2011, was converted to a registered mutual fund, the CBRE Clarion Long/Short Fund (the Fund).
1138118_15_ITEM8_P97_S1	As a result of this triggering event, we determined that the Fund became a VIE and that we were not the primary beneficiary.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P97_S2	Accordingly, in the first quarter of 2012, the Fund was deconsolidated from our consolidated financial statements and we recorded an investment in available for sale securities of $14.3 million.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P97_S3	No gain or loss was recognized in our consolidated statement of operations as a result of this deconsolidation.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P97_S4	Subsequently, in June 2013, we redeemed our investment in the Fund and recorded a gain of $0.1 million.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P97_S5	We also hold variable interests in certain VIEs in our Global Investment Management and Development Services segments which are not consolidated as it was determined that we are not the primary beneficiary.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P97_S6	Our involvement with these entities is in the form of equity co-investments and fee arrangements.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P98_S0	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, our maximum exposure to loss related to the VIEs which are not consolidated was as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_15_ITEM8_P99_S0	The Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 820) defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P99_S1	Topic 820 also establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P99_S2	This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P99_S3	The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:
1138118_15_ITEM8_P100_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P101_S0	Level 2 Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P102_S0	Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P102_S1	This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P102_S2	There were no significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P103_S0	The following tables present the fair value of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):
1138118_15_ITEM8_P104_S0	The fair values of the warehouse receivables are calculated based on already locked in security buy prices.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P104_S1	At December 31, 2014 and 2013, all of the warehouse receivables included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were either under commitment to be purchased by Freddie Mac or had confirmed forward trade commitments for the issuance and purchase of Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae mortgage backed securities that will be secured by the underlying loans (See Note 2).
1138118_15_ITEM8_P104_S2	These assets are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as all inputs are readily observable.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P105_S0	The valuation of interest rate swaps and foreign currency exchange forward contracts is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P105_S1	This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate and foreign currency exchange forward curves.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P106_S0	The fair values of interest rate swaps and foreign currency exchange forward contracts are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future estimated cash payments/receipts.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P106_S1	The estimated cash flows are based on an expectation of future interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates using forward curves derived from observable market interest rate and foreign currency exchange forward curves.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P107_S0	To comply with the provisions of Topic 820, we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P108_S0	In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we have considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P108_S1	In conjunction with our adoption of ASU 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs , we made an accounting policy election to measure the credit risk of our derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements on a net basis by counterparty portfolio.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P108_S2	Although we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by us and our counterparties.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P108_S3	However, as of December 31, 2014, we have determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P108_S4	As a result, our valuations of interest rate swaps and foreign currency exchange forward contracts are classified in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P109_S0	The valuation of our loan commitments is determined using discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P109_S1	The primary source of value of each written loan commitment is future servicing rights.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P109_S2	Mortgage servicing rights do not actively trade in an open market with readily available observable prices; therefore, fair value is determined based on certain assumptions and judgments, including the estimation of the present value of future cash flows realized from servicing the underlying mortgage loans (see Note 2).
1138118_15_ITEM8_P109_S3	As such, our loan commitments are classified in Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P109_S4	The following table provides additional information about fair value measurements for these Level 3 assets for the year ended December 31, 2014:
1138118_15_ITEM8_P110_S0	Fair value measurements for our available for sale securities are obtained from independent pricing services which utilize observable market data that may include quoted market prices, dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. treasury yield curve, trading levels, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the instrument s terms and conditions.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P111_S0	The trading securities and securities sold, not yet purchased are primarily in the U.S. and are generally valued at the last reported sales price on the day of valuation or, if no sales occurred on the valuation date, at the mean of the bid and asked prices on such date.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P111_S1	The following tables are a summary of our available for sale securities (dollars in thousands):
1138118_15_ITEM8_P112_S0	The net carrying value and estimated fair value of debt securities at December 31, 2014, by contractual maturity, are shown below.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P113_S0	Actual repayment dates may differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay obligations.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P114_S0	We did not record any significant dividends or interest income related to marketable securities for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P114_S1	The portion of net gains and losses for the year ended December 31, 2014 relating to trading securities still held at December 31, 2014 is calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_15_ITEM8_P115_S0	The portion of net gains and losses for the year ended December 31, 2013 relating to trading securities still held at December 31, 2013 is calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_15_ITEM8_P116_S0	The portion of net gains and losses for the year ended December 31, 2012 relating to trading securities still held at December 31, 2012 is calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_15_ITEM8_P117_S0	The following non-recurring fair value measurements were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 (dollars in thousands):
1138118_15_ITEM8_P118_S0	The fair value measurements employed for our impairment evaluations were generally based on third-party information available in non-active markets (such as third-party appraisals and offers received from third parties) as well as a discounted cash flow approach and/or review of comparable activities in the market place.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P118_S1	Inputs used in these evaluations included risk-free rates of return, estimated risk premiums as well as other economic variables.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P119_S0	Property and Equipment During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded an asset impairment of $8.6 million in our Americas segment.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P119_S1	This non-cash write-off resulted from the decision (due to a change in strategy) to abandon a property database platform that was being developed in the U.S.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P120_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded an asset impairment of $5.8 million in our Americas segment.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P120_S1	This non-cash write-off resulted from the decision (due to a change in strategy) to abandon certain modules of a software platform that were being developed in the U.S.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P120_S2	All of our impairment charges related to property and equipment were included within operating, administrative and other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P120_S3	Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded write-downs in our Global Investment Management segment of $3.6 million, of which $0.8 million were attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P120_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded write-downs in our Global Investment Management segment of $4.1 million, of which $1.0 million were attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P120_S5	These write-downs were primarily driven by challenging market conditions and a decrease in the estimated holding period of certain assets.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P120_S6	During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded write-downs of $3.9 million, of which $0.6 million were attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P121_S0	investment write-downs were reported in our Global Investment Management segment and $0.1 million were reported in our Development Services segment.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P121_S1	These write-downs were primarily driven by a decrease in the estimated holding period of certain assets and challenging market conditions.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P121_S2	All of our impairment charges related to investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries were included in equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P122_S0	Real Estate During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a provision for loss on real estate held for sale of $1.9 million, of which $1.8 million was attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P122_S1	This charge reduced the carrying value of certain assets to their fair value, less cost to sell, primarily due to reduced selling prices resulting from a decrease in the estimated holding period of certain assets.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P123_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded impairment charges of $26.5 million on real estate held for investment.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P123_S1	Of this amount, $15.9 million was attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P123_S2	These impairment charges were driven by a decrease in the estimated holding period of certain assets and challenging market conditions.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P123_S3	All of the abovementioned charges were reported in our Development Services segment, with the exception of a $9.3 million impairment charge reported in our Global Investment Management segment during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P123_S4	All of the abovementioned charges were included within operating, administrative and other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P124_S0	Other Intangible Assets During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a non-amortizable intangible asset impairment of $98.1 million in our Global Investment Management segment.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P124_S1	This non-cash write-off related to a decrease in value of our open-end funds, primarily in Europe.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P124_S2	These funds experienced a decline in assets under management, as the business mix shifted toward separate accounts, consistent with market movements following the extended financial crisis in Europe, which resulted in project sales and planned liquidations of certain funds.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P124_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded a non-amortizable intangible asset impairment of $19.8 million in our EMEA segment.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P124_S4	This non-cash write-off related to the discontinuation of the use of a trade name in the United Kingdom (U.K.).
1138118_15_ITEM8_P124_S5	All of our impairment charges related to non-amortizable intangible assets were included as a separate line item in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P125_S0	FASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P125_S1	Our financial instruments are as follows: Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash : These balances include cash and cash equivalents as well as restricted cash with maturities of less than three months.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P125_S2	The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P126_S0	Receivables, less Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: Due to their short-term nature, fair value approximates carrying value.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P127_S0	Warehouse Receivables: These balances are carried at fair value based on market prices at the balance sheet date.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P127_S1	Trading and Available for Sale Securities: These investments are carried at their fair value.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P127_S2	Foreign Currency Exchange Forward Contracts and Loan Commitments: These assets and liabilities are carried at their fair value as calculated by using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative (see Note 5).
1138118_15_ITEM8_P127_S3	Securities Sold, not yet Purchased: These liabilities are carried at their fair value.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P127_S4	Short-Term Borrowings : The majority of this balance represents outstanding amounts under our warehouse lines of credit for CBRE Capital Markets and revolving credit facility.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P127_S5	Due to the short-term nature and variable interest rates of these instruments, fair value approximates carrying value (see Note 12).
1138118_15_ITEM8_P128_S0	Senior Secured Term Loans : Based upon information from third-party banks (which falls within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy), the estimated fair value of our senior secured term loans was approximately $645.1 million and $687.6 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P128_S1	Their actual carrying value totaled $645.6 million and $685.3 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively (see Note 12).
1138118_15_ITEM8_P129_S0	Interest Rate Swaps : These liabilities are carried at their fair value as calculated by using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative (see Note 5).
1138118_15_ITEM8_P129_S1	5.00% Senior Notes : Based on dealers quotes (which falls within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy), the estimated fair value of our 5.00% senior notes was $818.0 million and $769.4 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P129_S2	Their actual carrying value totaled $800.0 million at both December 31, 2014 and 2013 (see Note 12).
1138118_15_ITEM8_P130_S0	5.25% Senior Notes : On September 26, 2014, CBRE issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due March 15, 2025.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P130_S1	On December 12, 2014, CBRE issued an additional $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due March 15, 2025 at a price equal to 101.5% of their face value, plus interest deemed to have accrued from September 26, 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P130_S2	Based on dealers quotes (which falls within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy), the estimated fair value of our 5.25% senior notes was $439.7 million at December 31, 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P130_S3	Their actual carrying value totaled $426.8 million at December 31, 2014 (see Note 12).
1138118_15_ITEM8_P130_S4	6.625% Senior Notes : Based on dealers quotes (which falls within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy), the estimated fair value of our 6.625% senior notes was $372.8 million at December 31, 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P130_S5	Their actual carrying value totaled $350.0 million at December 31, 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P130_S6	We redeemed these notes in full on October 27, 2014 (see Note 12).
1138118_15_ITEM8_P130_S7	Notes Payable on Real Estate: As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the carrying value of our notes payable on real estate was $42.8 million and $130.5 million, respectively (see Note 11).
1138118_15_ITEM8_P131_S0	These borrowings generally have floating interest rates at spreads over a market rate index.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P132_S0	It is likely that some portion of our notes payable on real estate have fair values lower than actual carrying values.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P132_S1	Given the cost involved in estimating their fair value, we determined it was not practicable to do so.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P132_S2	Additionally, only $4.0 million of these notes payable were recourse to us as of December 31, 2013 (none were recourse at December 31, 2014).
1138118_15_ITEM8_P133_S0	Derivative Financial Instruments We are exposed to certain risks arising from both our business operations and economic conditions.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P133_S1	We manage economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of our debt funding and by using derivative financial instruments.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P133_S2	Specifically, we enter into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the payment of future known but uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P133_S3	Our derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of our known or expected cash payments principally related to our borrowings.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P133_S4	We do not net derivatives on our balance sheet.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P133_S5	Our objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P133_S6	To accomplish this objective, we primarily use interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P133_S7	In March 2011, we entered into five interest rate swap agreements, all with effective dates in October 2011, and immediately designated them as cash flow hedges in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging .
1138118_15_ITEM8_P133_S8	The purpose of these interest rate swap agreements is to attempt to hedge potential changes to our cash flows due to the variable interest nature of our senior secured term loan facilities.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P133_S9	The total notional amount of these interest rate swap agreements is $400.0 million, with $200.0 million expiring in October 2017 and $200.0 million expiring in September 2019.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P134_S0	The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P134_S1	There was no significant hedge ineffectiveness for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P135_S0	The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the balance sheet and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P135_S1	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, there was $26.9 million and $29.0 million, respectively, included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets related to these interest rate swaps, which will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on our senior secured term loan facilities.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P135_S2	During the next twelve months, we estimate that $11.3 million will be reclassified to interest expense.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P135_S3	The following table presents the fair value of our interest rate swaps as well as their classification on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):

1138118_15_ITEM8_P138_S0	The following table presents the effect of our interest rate swaps on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 (dollars in thousands):
1138118_15_ITEM8_P139_S0	We have agreements with some of our derivative counterparties that contain a provision where (1) if we default on any of our indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then we could also be declared in default on our derivative obligations; or (2) we could be declared in default on our derivative obligations if repayment of the underlying indebtedness is accelerated by the lender due to our default on the indebtedness.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P139_S1	As of December 31, 2014, the fair value of derivatives related to these agreements was a net liability position of $27.9 million, which includes accrued interest.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P139_S2	As of December 31, 2014, we have not posted any collateral related to these agreements and had not breached any of the provisions discussed above.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P139_S3	Had we breached any of the provisions discussed above at December 31, 2014, we may have been required to settle our obligations under the agreements at their termination value of $28.0 million.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P140_S0	From time to time, we also enter into interest rate swap and cap agreements in order to limit our interest expense related to our notes payable on real estate.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P140_S1	If any of these agreements are not designated as effective hedges, then they are marked to market each period with the change in fair value recognized in current period earnings.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P141_S0	The net impact on our earnings resulting from gains and/or losses on interest rate swap and cap agreements associated with notes payable on real estate has not been significant.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P141_S1	Additionally, certain of our foreign operations expose us to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P141_S2	These fluctuations may impact the value of our cash receipts and payments in terms of our functional currency.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P141_S3	We enter into derivative financial instruments to attempt to protect the value or fix the amount of certain obligations in terms of our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P141_S4	In March 2014, we began a foreign currency exchange forward hedging program by entering into 38 foreign currency exchange forward contracts, including agreements to buy U.S. dollars and sell Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, Japanese yen, Euros, and British pound sterling covering an initial notional amount of $209.7 million.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P142_S0	Hedge accounting was not elected for any of these contracts.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P142_S1	As such, changes in the fair values of these contracts are recorded directly in earnings.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P143_S0	Included in the consolidated statement of operations were net gains of $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 resulting from net gains on foreign currency exchange forward contracts.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P143_S1	As of December 31, 2014, we had 52 foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding covering a notional amount of $302.0 million.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P143_S2	As of December 31, 2014, the fair value of forward contracts with two counterparties aggregated to a $0.5 million asset position, which was included in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

1138118_15_ITEM8_P143_S4	We also routinely monitor our exposure to currency exchange rate changes in connection with certain transactions and sometimes enter into foreign currency exchange option and forward contracts to limit our exposure to such transactions, as appropriate.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P143_S5	In the normal course of business, we also sometimes utilize derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange contracts to attempt to mitigate foreign currency exchange exposure resulting from intercompany loans.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P143_S6	Included in the consolidated statements of operations were net gains of $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, and net losses of $1.8 million and $4.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, resulting from net gains/losses on these foreign currency exchange option and forward contracts.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P143_S7	As of December 31, 2014, the fair value of forward contracts with one counterparty aggregated to a $0.8 million asset position, which was included in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

1138118_15_ITEM8_P143_S10	We also enter into loan commitments that relate to the origination of commercial mortgage loans that will be held for resale.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P143_S11	FASB ASC Topic 815 requires that these commitments be recorded at their fair values as derivatives.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P143_S12	Included in the consolidated statements of operations were net gains of $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, resulting from gains on these loan commitments.

1138118_15_ITEM8_P146_S3	The following table summarizes the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands): On December 23, 2013, we completed the Norland Acquisition by acquiring 100% of the outstanding stock of London-based Norland, which fortified our real estate outsourcing platform in Europe within our EMEA segment.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P146_S4	The purchase price for the Norland Acquisition was approximately $474 million, with $433.9 million paid at closing and the remaining contingent consideration (described below) paid in July 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P146_S5	The Norland Acquisition was financed with cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P146_S6	On December 23, 2013, we also issued an aggregate of 362,916 shares of non-vested Class A common stock to certain members of senior management of Norland in connection with this acquisition.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P147_S0	The acquisition agreement provided for a contingent payment of up to 50.0 million British pounds sterling if certain performance criteria were met post-acquisition.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P147_S1	In measuring the fair value of the contingent consideration at acquisition date, we assigned probabilities of achievement to the performance criteria, based on the nature of the performance criteria and our due diligence performed at the time of the acquisition.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P147_S2	The fair value of this contingent consideration at acquisition date was based on the weighted probability of achievement of a certain earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) level for the twelve months ended March 31, 2014, which ranged from 22.1 million to 35.0 million British pounds sterling.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P147_S3	We valued this contingent payment at 25.5 million British pounds sterling (or $41.8 million) at acquisition date.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P147_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2014, the contingent payment was adjusted to 24.4 million British pounds sterling (or $40.0 million) based upon the EBITDA achieved for the twelve months ended March 31, 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P147_S5	The reduction of approximately 1.1 million British pounds sterling (or $1.8 million) from what was initially recorded at acquisition date was reflected in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2014 in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

1138118_15_ITEM8_P147_S8	The purchase accounting for the Norland Acquisition has been finalized.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P147_S9	The excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired has been recorded to goodwill.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P147_S10	The goodwill arising from the Norland Acquisition consists largely of the synergies and economies of scale expected from combining the operations acquired from Norland with ours.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P147_S11	No goodwill recorded in connection with the Norland Acquisition is deductible for tax purposes.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P147_S12	Unaudited pro forma results, assuming the Norland Acquisition had occurred as of January 1, 2012 for purposes of the 2013 and 2012 pro forma disclosures, are presented below.

1138118_15_ITEM8_P149_S2	When we performed our required annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we determined that no impairment existed as the estimated fair value of our reporting units was in excess of their carrying value.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P150_S0	Other intangible assets totaled $802.4 million and $841.2 million, net of accumulated amortization of $463.4 million and $348.6 million, as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and are comprised of the following (dollars in thousands): Management contracts with indefinite useful lives primarily represent intangible assets identified as a result of the REIM Acquisitions relating to relationships with open-end funds.

1138118_15_ITEM8_P190_S3	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, there were no amounts outstanding under this facility.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P191_S0	Commitments and Contingencies We are a party to a number of pending or threatened lawsuits arising out of, or incident to, our ordinary course of business.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P191_S1	Our management believes that any losses in excess of the amounts accrued arising from such lawsuits are unlikely to be significant, but that litigation is inherently uncertain and there is the potential for a material adverse effect on our financial statements if one or more matters are resolved in a particular period in an amount materially in excess of that anticipated by management.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P192_S0	Our leases generally relate to office space that we occupy, have varying terms and expire at various dates through 2030.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P192_S1	The following is a schedule by year of future minimum lease payments for noncancellable operating leases as of December 31, 2014 (dollars in thousands):
1138118_15_ITEM8_P193_S0	Total minimum payments for noncancellable operating leases were not reduced by the minimum sublease rental income of $7.1 million due in the future under noncancellable subleases.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P194_S0	Substantially all leases require us to pay maintenance costs, insurance and property taxes.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P194_S1	The composition of total rental expense under noncancellable operating leases consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_15_ITEM8_P195_S0	In January 2008, CBRE Multifamily Capital, Inc. (CBRE MCI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBRE Capital Markets, entered into an agreement with Fannie Mae, under Fannie Mae s DUS Lender Program (DUS Program), to provide financing for multifamily housing with five or more units.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P195_S1	Under the DUS Program, CBRE MCI originates, underwrites, closes and services loans without prior approval by Fannie Mae, and in selected cases, is subject to sharing up to one-third of any losses on loans originated under the DUS Program.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P195_S2	CBRE MCI has funded loans subject to such loss sharing arrangements with unpaid principal balances of $9.7 billion at December 31, 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P195_S3	Additionally, CBRE MCI has funded loans under the DUS Program that are not subject to loss sharing arrangements with unpaid principal balances of approximately $293.7 million at December 31, 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P196_S0	CBRE MCI, under its agreement with Fannie Mae, must post cash reserves or other acceptable collateral under formulas established by Fannie Mae to provide for sufficient capital in the event losses occur.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P196_S1	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, CBRE MCI had a $29.0 million letter of credit and $16.6 million of cash deposited, respectively, under this reserve arrangement, and had provided approximately $16.8 million and $13.8 million, respectively, of loan loss accruals.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P196_S2	Fannie Mae s recourse under the DUS Program is limited to the assets of CBRE MCI, which totaled approximately $310.2 million (including $165.9 million of warehouse receivables, a substantial majority of which are pledged against warehouse lines of credit and are therefore not available to Fannie Mae) at December 31, 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P196_S3	We had outstanding letters of credit totaling $40.9 million as of December 31, 2014, excluding letters of credit for which we have outstanding liabilities already accrued on our consolidated balance sheet related to our subsidiaries outstanding reserves for claims under certain insurance programs as well as letters of credit related to operating leases.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P196_S4	CBRE MCI s letter of credit totaling $29.0 million referred to in the preceding paragraph represented the majority of the $40.9 million outstanding letters of credit.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P196_S5	The remaining letters of credit are primarily executed by us in the ordinary course of business and expire at varying dates through December 2015.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P197_S0	We had guarantees totaling $13.8 million as of December 31, 2014, excluding guarantees related to pension liabilities, consolidated indebtedness and other obligations for which we have outstanding liabilities already accrued on our consolidated balance sheet, and operating leases.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P197_S1	The $13.8 million mainly represents guarantees of obligations of unconsolidated subsidiaries, which expire at varying dates through December 2018, as well as various guarantees of management contracts in our operations overseas, which expire at the end of each of the respective agreements.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P197_S2	In addition, as of December 31, 2014, we had numerous completion and budget guarantees relating to development projects.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P197_S3	These guarantees are made by us in the ordinary course of our Development Services business.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P197_S4	Each of these guarantees requires us to complete construction of the relevant project within a specified timeframe and/or within a specified budget, with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P197_S5	However, we generally have guaranteed maximum price contracts with reputable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P197_S6	These contracts are intended to pass the risk to such contractors.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P197_S7	While there can be no assurance, we do not expect to incur any material losses under these guarantees.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P198_S0	An important part of the strategy for our Global Investment Management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P198_S1	These co-investments typically range from 2.0% to 5.0% of the equity in a particular fund.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P198_S2	As of December 31, 2014, we had aggregate commitments of $19.0 million to fund future co-investments.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P198_S3	Additionally, an important part of our Development Services business strategy is to invest in unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries as a principal (in most cases co-investing with our clients).
1138118_15_ITEM8_P198_S4	As of December 31, 2014, we had committed to fund $25.5 million of additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P199_S0	Employee Benefit Plans Stock Incentive Plans Second Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P199_S1	Our 2004 stock incentive plan was adopted by our board of directors and approved by our stockholders on April 21, 2004, and was amended several times subsequently, including an amendment and restatement on June 2, 2008 and an amendment on December 3, 2008.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P199_S2	However, our 2004 stock incentive plan was terminated in May 2012 in connection with the adoption of our 2012 equity incentive plan, which is described below.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P199_S3	At termination, all unissued shares from the 2004 stock incentive plan were allocated to the 2012 equity incentive plan for potential future issuance.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P200_S0	The 2004 stock incentive plan authorized the grant of stock-based awards to our employees, directors or independent contractors.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P200_S1	A total of 20,785,218 shares of our Class A common stock initially were reserved for issuance under the 2004 stock incentive plan, which increased by 10,000,000 shares to a total of 30,785,218 shares in connection with the June 2, 2008 amendment and restatement.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P200_S2	For awards granted prior to June 2, 2008 under this plan, this share reserve was reduced by one share upon grant of an option or stock appreciation right, and was reduced by 2.25 shares upon issuance of stock pursuant to other stock-based awards.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P200_S3	For awards granted on or after June 2, 2008 under this plan, this share reserve was reduced by one share upon grant of all awards.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P200_S4	In addition, full value awards, i.e., awards other than stock options and stock appreciation rights, were limited to no more than 75% of the total share reserve.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P200_S5	No person was eligible to be granted awards in the aggregate covering more than 2,000,000 shares during any fiscal year.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P201_S0	The number of shares issued or reserved pursuant to the 2004 stock incentive plan, or pursuant to outstanding awards, was subject to adjustment on account of mergers, consolidations, reorganizations, stock splits, stock dividends and other dilutive changes in our common stock.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P201_S1	In addition, our board of directors could adjust outstanding awards to preserve the awards benefits or potential benefits.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P201_S2	Since our 2004 stock incentive plan has been terminated, no new awards may be granted under it.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P202_S0	outstanding according to their terms, and we will continue to issue shares to the extent required under the terms of such outstanding awards.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P202_S1	Shares underlying awards that expire, terminate or lapse under the 2004 stock incentive plan will become available for grant under the 2012 equity incentive plan.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P202_S2	Our 2012 equity incentive plan was adopted by our board of directors and approved by our stockholders on May 8, 2012.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P202_S3	The 2012 equity incentive plan authorizes the grant of stock-based awards to our employees, directors or independent contractors.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P202_S4	Unless terminated earlier, the 2012 equity incentive plan will terminate on February 13, 2022.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P203_S0	A total of 16,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock plus 2,205,887 unissued shares that remained under the 2004 stock incentive plan were reserved for issuance under the 2012 equity incentive plan.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P203_S1	Additionally, shares underlying awards that expire, terminate or lapse under the 2012 equity incentive plan or under the 2004 stock incentive plan will become available for issuance under the 2012 equity incentive plan.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P204_S0	No person is eligible to be granted performance-based awards in the aggregate covering more than 3,300,000 shares during any fiscal year or cash awards in excess of $5,000,000 for any fiscal year.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P205_S0	The number of shares issued or reserved pursuant to the 2012 equity incentive plan, or pursuant to outstanding awards, is subject to adjustment on account of a stock split of our outstanding shares, stock dividend, dividend payable in a form other than shares in an amount that has a material effect on the price of the shares, consolidation, combination or reclassification of the shares, recapitalization, spin-off, or other similar occurrence.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P206_S0	Stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under the 2012 equity incentive plan are subject to a maximum term of ten years from the date of grant.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P206_S1	Restricted share and restricted stock unit awards that have only time-based service vesting conditions are generally subject to a minimum three year vesting schedule.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P206_S2	Restricted share and restricted stock unit awards that have performance-based vesting conditions are generally subject to a minimum one year vesting schedule.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P206_S3	As of December 31, 2014, assuming the maximum number of shares under our performance-based awards will later be issued (as further described under Equity Compensation Plan Information below), 12,163,174 shares remained available for future grants under this plan.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P206_S4	As of December 31, 2014, no shares were subject to options issued under our 2012 equity incentive plan.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P206_S5	No options were granted during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P206_S6	All options that have been granted under the 2004 stock incentive plan have a term of five or seven years from the date of grant.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P206_S7	A summary of the status of our outstanding stock options is presented in the tables below:
1138118_15_ITEM8_P207_S0	We estimate the fair value of our options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which takes into account assumptions such as the dividend yield, the risk-free interest rate, the expected stock price volatility and the expected life of the options.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P207_S1	The total estimated grant date fair value of stock options that vested during the year ended December 31, 2014 was $0.03 million.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P208_S0	The dividend yield assumption is excluded from the calculation, as it is our present intention to retain all earnings.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P208_S1	The expected volatility is based on a combination of our historical stock price and implied volatility.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P208_S2	The selection of implied volatility data to estimate expected volatility is based upon the availability of actively traded options on our stock.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P208_S3	The risk-free interest rate is based upon the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the options.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P208_S4	The expected life of our stock options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is based on historical experience of similar options, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P209_S0	Option valuation models require the input of subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility and expected life.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P209_S1	Because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, we do not believe that the Black-Scholes model necessarily provides a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P210_S0	Options outstanding at December 31, 2014 and their related weighted average exercise price, intrinsic value and life information is presented below: At December 31, 2014, the aggregate intrinsic value and weighted average remaining contractual life for options vested and expected to vest were $14.3 million and 1.0 year, respectively.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P210_S1	Total compensation expense related to stock options was $0.03 million, $0.4 million and $2.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P210_S2	The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $7.6 million, $31.9 million and $16.4 million, respectively.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P210_S3	We recorded cash received from stock option exercises of $6.2 million, $5.8 million and $20.3 million and related tax benefit of $1.2 million, $9.9 million and $2.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P211_S0	Upon option exercise, we issue new shares of stock.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P212_S0	Excess tax benefits exist when the tax deduction resulting from the exercise of options exceeds the compensation cost recorded.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P213_S0	Non-Vested Stock Awards We have issued non-vested stock awards, including restricted stock units and restricted shares, in our Class A common stock to certain of our employees, independent contractors and members of our board of directors.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P213_S1	The following is a summary of the awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P214_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2014, we granted 2,118,637 non-vested stock units, which includes (a) 1,604,744 non-vested stock units, which primarily vest and are generally exercisable in equal annual increments over four years from the date of grant, and (b) a target award amount of 513,893 performance-based non-vested stock units subject to the Company s achievement of certain adjusted earnings per share (EPS) targets (over a minimum threshold), as measured on a cumulative basis over a two-year performance-measurement period, with full vesting of any earned amount on the third anniversary of the grant date.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P214_S1	In respect of the adjusted EPS performance-based stock units (EPS PSUs), the awards were granted with a target number of restricted stock units, zero to 200% of which may be earned depending on the Company s actual adjusted EPS over the performance period.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P215_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2013, we granted 2,596,830 non-vested stock units, which includes (a) 1,613,906 non-vested stock units, which primarily vest and are generally exercisable in equal annual increments over four years from the date of grant, (b) 329,100 performance-based non-vested stock units that were initially subject to the Company achieving a minimum adjusted EBITDA threshold of $808.7 million for the twelve month period ended June 30, 2014, but which threshold the Company satisfied such that the awards are scheduled to vest and become exercisable 25% per year over four years from the grant date (with the first tranche having vested in September 2014), and (c) a target award amount of 653,824 EPS PSUs subject to similar terms to those granted in 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P215_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2013, we also granted 72,580 restricted shares, which cliff vest in 2018 and are generally subject to the grantee not terminating employment under certain circumstances prior to this date.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P216_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2012, we granted 2,353,487 non-vested stock units, which primarily vest and are generally exercisable in equal annual increments over four years from the date of grant.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P216_S1	A summary of the status of our non-vested stock awards is presented in the table below:
1138118_15_ITEM8_P217_S0	Total compensation expense related to non-vested stock awards was $59.7 million, $48.0 million and $49.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P217_S1	At December 31, 2014, total unrecognized estimated compensation cost related to non-vested stock awards was approximately $114.5 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.9 years.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P218_S0	We have bonus programs covering select employees, including senior management.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P218_S1	Awards are based on the position and performance of the employee and the achievement of pre-established financial, operating and strategic objectives.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P218_S2	The amounts charged to expense for bonuses were $206.3 million, $148.7 million and $134.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P219_S0	Our CBRE 401(k) Plan (401(k) Plan) is a defined contribution savings plan that allows participant deferrals under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P219_S1	Most of our non-union U.S. employees, other than qualified real estate agents having the status of independent contractors under section 3508 of the Internal Revenue Code, are eligible to participate in the plan.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P219_S2	The 401(k) Plan provides for participant contributions as well as a Company match.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P219_S3	A participant is allowed to contribute to the 401(k) Plan from 1% to 75% of his or her compensation, subject to limits imposed by applicable law.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P219_S4	Effective January 1, 2007, all participants hired post January 1, 2007 vest in company match contributions 20% per year for each plan year they work 1,000 hours.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P219_S5	All participants hired before January 1, 2007 are immediately vested in company match contributions.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P219_S6	For 2014, we contributed a 50% match on the first 4% of annual compensation (up to $150,000 of compensation) deferred by each participant.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P219_S7	For 2013 and 2012, we contributed a 50% match on the first 3% of annual compensation (up to $150,000 of compensation) deferred by each participant.

1138118_15_ITEM8_P220_S0	Participants are entitled to invest up to 25% of their 401(k) account balance in shares of our common stock.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P220_S1	As of December 31, 2014, approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock were held as investments by participants in our 401(k) Plan.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P221_S0	We have two contributory defined benefit pension plans in the U.K.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P221_S1	The London-based firm of Hillier Parker May Rowden, which we acquired in 1998, had a contributory defined benefit pension plan.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P221_S2	A subsidiary of Insignia, which we acquired in connection with the Insignia Acquisition in 2003, also had a contributory defined benefit pension plan in the U.K.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P221_S3	Our subsidiaries based in the U.K. maintain the plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in these plans.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P221_S4	With respect to these plans, our historical policy has been to contribute annually an amount to fund pension cost as actuarially determined and as required by applicable laws and regulations.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P221_S5	Effective July 1, 2007, we reached agreements with the active members of these plans to freeze future pension plan benefits.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P221_S6	In return, the active members became eligible to enroll in a defined contribution plan.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P222_S0	The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the benefit obligation, plan assets, plan s funded status and amounts recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets for both of our defined benefit pension plans (dollars in thousands):
1138118_15_ITEM8_P223_S0	The accumulated benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans was $421.2 million and $400.2 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P223_S1	Items not yet recognized as a component of net periodic pension (benefit) cost were as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_15_ITEM8_P224_S0	The estimated net actuarial loss that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic pension cost in 2015 is $4.2 million.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P225_S0	Components of net periodic pension (benefit) cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive loss consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_15_ITEM8_P225_S1	Weighted average assumptions used to determine our projected benefit obligation were as follows:
1138118_15_ITEM8_P225_S2	Weighted average assumptions used to determine our net periodic pension (benefit) cost were as follows: We select a discount rate by reference to yields available at our balance sheet date on U.K. AA-rated corporate bonds.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P226_S0	The corporate bond yield curve is derived by taking a government bond yield curve, based on Bank of England data and adding an amount to reflect the yield spread on AA-rated bonds over government bonds.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P226_S1	This discount rate selected is the weighted average of the yields on the resulting bond yield curve, where the weighting is based on the expected cash flow from the weighted average duration of the pension plans.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P227_S0	We review historical rates of return for equity and fixed income securities, as well as current economic conditions, to determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P227_S1	The assumed rate of return for 2014 is based on 57.2% of the portfolio being invested in equities yielding a 6.4% return, 28.2% of the portfolio being invested in an absolute return strategy fund yielding a 5.9% return and 7.1% of assets being primarily invested in corporate and government debt securities yielding a 3.7% return.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P227_S2	Consideration is given to diversification and periodic rebalancing of the portfolio based on prevailing market conditions.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P228_S0	Our pension plan weighted average asset allocations by asset category were as follows:
1138118_15_ITEM8_P229_S0	Our pension trust assets are invested with a long-term focus to achieve a return on investment that is based on levels of liquidity and investment risk that the trustees, in consultation with management believe are prudent and reasonable.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P229_S1	The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income and index linked investments consisting primarily of government debt.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P229_S2	The equity investments are diversified across U.K. and non-U.K. equities, as well as value, growth, and medium and large capitalizations.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P229_S3	The portfolio s asset mix is reviewed regularly, and the portfolio is rebalanced based on existing market conditions.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P229_S4	Investment risk is measured and monitored on a regular basis through quarterly portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements and periodic asset/liability analyses.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P229_S5	The fair value of our pension assets are comprised of the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_15_ITEM8_P230_S0	(a) The assets in this category represent investments in foreign equity and bond funds.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P230_S1	Generally, these assets are valued using bid-market valuations provided by the funds investment managers.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P231_S0	(b) The assets in this category represent investments in an absolute return strategies fund.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P231_S1	Generally, these assets are valued at the net asset value as determined by the custodian of the fund.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P232_S0	As such, the assets in this category have been categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P233_S0	(c) The assets in this category include investments in a liability driven investment fund and investments in commercial real estate.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P233_S1	The liability driven investment fund is a single priced fund and the fair value of the underlying assets are priced by the fund s custodian based on observable market data and therefore categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P234_S0	The investments in commercial real estate primarily represent a property unit trust that invests in commercial real estate properties in the U.K.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P234_S1	The fair values for these investments are based on inputs obtained from broker quotes that are indicative of value and cannot be corroborated by observable market data and therefore are categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P234_S2	A summary of our pension assets measured and recorded using significant unobservable inputs is as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_15_ITEM8_P235_S0	There were no significant transfers into or out of Level 3 during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P235_S1	We expect to contribute $6.1 million to our pension plans in 2015.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P236_S0	The following is a schedule by year of benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, that are expected to be paid (dollars in thousands):
1138118_15_ITEM8_P237_S0	We also have defined contribution plans for employees in the U.K.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P237_S1	Our contributions to these plans were approximately $11.3 million, $10.9 million and $9.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P238_S0	The components of income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes consisted of the following (dollars in thousands): Our tax provision (benefit) consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_15_ITEM8_P238_S1	The following is a reconciliation stated as a percentage of pre-tax income of the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate:
1138118_15_ITEM8_P239_S0	During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, we recorded a $2.2 million, $10.5 million and $5.3 million income tax benefit in connection with stock options exercised.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P239_S1	Of this income tax benefit, $1.2 million, $9.9 million and $2.9 million was charged directly to additional paid-in capital within the equity section of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P239_S2	Cumulative tax effects of temporary differences are shown below at December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):
1138118_15_ITEM8_P240_S0	As of December 31, 2014, we had U.S. federal net operating losses (NOLs) of approximately $31.9 million, translating to a deferred tax asset before valuation allowance of $11.2 million, which will begin to expire in 2023.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P240_S1	As of December 31, 2014, there were also deferred tax assets before valuation allowances of approximately $4.4 million related to state NOLs as well as $34.7 million related to foreign NOLs.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P240_S2	The state and foreign NOLs both begin to expire in 2015, but the majority carry forward indefinitely.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P241_S0	The utilization of NOLs may be subject to certain limitations under U.S. federal, state and foreign laws.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P241_S1	In addition, as of December 31, 2014, we had $53.5 million of foreign income tax credits that can be utilized to offset U.S. federal income taxes on foreign-sourced earnings.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P241_S2	These credits are scheduled to expire in 2023.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P242_S0	Management determined that as of December 31, 2014, $93.5 million of deferred tax assets do not satisfy the realization criteria set forth in Topic 740.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P242_S1	Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been recorded for this amount.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P242_S2	If released, the entire amount would result in a benefit to continuing operations.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P242_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2014, our valuation allowance decreased by approximately $5.1 million.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P242_S4	This was primarily the result of $8.8 million related to the release of valuation allowance on U.S. foreign tax credits, the utilization of $7.0 million related to non-U.S. net operating losses and other foreign assets and $3.8 million related to foreign net operating loss adjustments.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P242_S5	These decreases were partially offset by establishment of valuation allowances of $7.9 million related to non-U.S. net operating losses and other foreign assets and $6.6 million related to U.S. net operating losses and other U.S. assets.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P242_S6	Management believes it is more likely than not that future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets recorded net of these valuation allowances.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P243_S0	Our foreign subsidiaries have accumulated $1.3 billion of undistributed earnings for which we have not recorded a deferred tax liability.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P243_S1	Although tax liabilities might result from dividends being paid out of these earnings, or as a result of a sale or liquidation of non-U.S. subsidiaries, these earnings are permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. and we do not have any plans to repatriate them or to sell or liquidate any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P243_S2	To the extent that we are able to repatriate the earnings in a tax efficient manner, or in the event of a change in our capital situation or investment strategy in which such funds become needed for funding our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds, net of foreign tax credits.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P243_S3	Determining our tax liability upon repatriation is not practicable.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P243_S4	Cash and cash equivalents owned by non-U.S. subsidiaries totaled $287.4 million at December 31, 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P243_S5	In 2012 and 2013, we repatriated $58.0 million and $196.2 million, respectively.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P243_S6	In anticipation of these repatriations, tax benefits of $28.8 million were recorded in 2012.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P243_S7	Additional tax benefits associated with the release of valuation allowances of $14.5 million and $4.9 million were recorded in 2013 and 2014, respectively.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P243_S8	The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $67.0 million and $95.7 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P243_S9	The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect our effective tax rate, if recognized, is $37.6 million ($35.8 million, net of federal benefit received from state positions) and $50.8 million ($48.8 million, net of federal benefit received from state positions) as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P243_S10	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 is as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_15_ITEM8_P244_S0	We believe it is reasonably possible that between $22.0 million and $27.8 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits will be settled during the next twelve months due to filing amended returns and the conclusion of an advanced pricing agreement.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P244_S1	Our continuing practice is to recognize potential accrued interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters within income tax expense.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P244_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we accrued an additional $3.0 million, $2.6 million and $3.3 million, respectively, in interest associated with uncertain tax positions.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P244_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2014, we reversed $10.5 million of accrued interest and penalties related to settled positions.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P244_S4	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we have recognized a liability for interest and penalties of $25.5 million ($19.8 million, net of related federal benefit received from interest expense) and $33.0 million ($25.9 million, net of related federal benefit received from interest expense), respectively.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P245_S0	We conduct business globally and, as a result, one or more of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in multiple state, local and foreign jurisdictions.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P245_S1	We are no longer open to assessment by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for years prior to 2005.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P245_S2	With limited exception, our significant state and foreign tax jurisdictions are no longer subject to audit by the various tax authorities for tax years prior to 2007.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P246_S0	Our board of directors is authorized, subject to any limitations imposed by law, without the approval of our stockholders, to issue a total of 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, in one or more series, with each such series having rights and preferences including voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences, as our board of directors may determine.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P246_S1	We may repurchase shares awarded to grant recipients under our various equity compensation plans in order to satisfy minimum statutory federal, state and local tax withholding obligations arising from the vesting of their equity awards.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P246_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, 242,461 and 601,917 shares, respectively, with an average price paid per share of $31.31 and $22.00, respectively, were repurchased relating thereto.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P247_S0	The following is a calculation of earnings per share (dollars in thousands, except share data):
1138118_15_ITEM8_P247_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, 58,631, 72,580 and 2,210,383, respectively, of contingently issuable shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P248_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, options to purchase 51,426 and 103,423, respectively, shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P248_S1	These options were excluded because their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect given that the options exercise prices were greater than the average market price of our common stock for each period.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P248_S2	The accompanying consolidated balance sheets do not include the net assets of escrow, agency and fiduciary funds, which are held by us on behalf of clients and which amounted to $2.6 billion and $2.1 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P249_S0	Discontinued Operations Real estate operations and dispositions accounted for as discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were reported in our Global Investment Management and Development Services segments as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_15_ITEM8_P250_S0	Segments We report our operations through the following segments: (1) Americas, (2) EMEA, (3) Asia Pacific, (4) Global Investment Management and (5) Development Services.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P251_S0	The Americas segment is our largest segment of operations and provides a comprehensive range of services throughout the U.S. and in the largest regions of Canada and key markets in Latin America.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P251_S1	The primary services offered consist of the following: real estate services, mortgage loan origination and servicing, valuation services, asset services and corporate services.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P251_S2	Our EMEA and Asia Pacific segments provide services similar to the Americas business segment.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P251_S3	The EMEA segment has operations primarily in Europe, while the Asia Pacific segment has operations primarily in Asia, Australia and New Zealand.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P252_S0	Our Global Investment Management business provides investment management services to clients seeking to generate returns and diversification through direct and indirect investments in real estate in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P252_S1	Our Development Services business consists of real estate development and investment activities primarily in the U.S. Summarized financial information by segment is as follows (dollars in thousands): EBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P252_S2	Our management believes EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P252_S3	Such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P253_S0	our management uses EBITDA as a measure to evaluate the operating performance of our various business segments and for other discretionary purposes, including as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive programs.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P253_S1	Additionally, we believe EBITDA is useful to investors to assist them in getting a more complete picture of our results of operations.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P253_S2	However, EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under GAAP and when analyzing our operating performance, readers should use EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P253_S3	Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P253_S4	Furthermore, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management s discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P253_S5	The amounts shown for EBITDA also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P254_S0	Net interest expense and write-off of financing costs have been expensed in the segment incurred.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P254_S1	Provision for income taxes has been allocated among our segments by using applicable U.S. and foreign effective tax rates.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P254_S2	EBITDA for our segments is calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_15_ITEM8_P255_S0	Identifiable assets by segment are those assets used in our operations in each segment.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P255_S1	Corporate identifiable assets include cash and cash equivalents available for general corporate use and net deferred tax assets.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P256_S0	The revenue shown in the table above is allocated based upon the country in which services are performed.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P256_S1	The long-lived assets shown in the table above are comprised of net property and equipment.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P256_S2	Related Party Transactions Included in prepaid expenses, other current assets and other long-term assets, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are loans to related parties, primarily employees other than our executive officers, of $126.5 million and $98.2 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P256_S3	The majority of these loans represent sign-on and retention bonuses issued or assumed in connection with acquisitions and prepaid commissions as well as prepaid retention and recruitment awards issued to employees.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P256_S4	These loans are at varying principal amounts, bear interest at rates up to 5.06% per annum and mature on various dates through 2021.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P257_S0	The following condensed consolidating financial information includes: (1) Condensed consolidating balance sheets as of December 31, 2014 and 2013; condensed consolidating statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012; condensed consolidating statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012; and condensed consolidating statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, of (a) CBRE Group, Inc. as the parent, (b) CBRE as the subsidiary issuer, (c) the guarantor subsidiaries, (d) the nonguarantor subsidiaries and (e) CBRE Group, Inc. on a consolidated basis; and (2) Elimination entries necessary to consolidate CBRE Group, Inc. as the parent, with CBRE and its guarantor and nonguarantor subsidiaries.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P257_S1	Investments in consolidated subsidiaries are presented using the equity method of accounting.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P257_S2	The principal elimination entries eliminate investments in consolidated subsidiaries and intercompany balances and transactions.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P258_S0	Although CBRE Capital Markets is included among our domestic subsidiaries that jointly and severally guarantee our 5.00% senior notes, 5.25% senior notes and our 2013 Credit Agreement, a substantial majority of warehouse receivables funded under BofA, JP Morgan, Capital One and Fannie Mae ASAP lines of credit are pledged to BofA, JP Morgan, Capital One and Fannie Mae, and accordingly, are not included as collateral for these notes or our other outstanding debt.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P259_S0	Although CBRE Capital Markets is included among our domestic subsidiaries that jointly and severally guarantee our 5.00% senior notes, 6.625% senior notes and our 2013 Credit Agreement, a substantial majority of warehouse receivables funded under the BofA, TD Bank, JP Morgan, Capital One, the JP Morgan Master Purchase Agreement and Fannie Mae ASAP lines of credit are pledged to BofA, TD Bank, JP Morgan, Capital One and Fannie Mae, and accordingly, are not included as collateral for these notes or our other outstanding debt.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P260_S0	On January 9, 2015, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the 2015 Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks jointly led by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner Smith Incorporated, J.P Morgan Securities LLC and CS.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P260_S1	Our New Credit Agreement currently provides for the following: (1) a $2.6 billion revolving credit facility, including revolving credit loans, letters of credit and a swingline loan facility, maturing on January 9, 2020; and (2) a $500.0 million tranche A term loan facility requiring quarterly principal payments, which begin on June 30, 2015 and continue through maturity on January 9, 2020.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P260_S2	The new revolving credit facility allows for borrowings outside of the United States, with a $75.0 million sub-facility available to one of our Canadian subsidiaries, a $100.0 million sub-facility available to one of our Australian subsidiaries and one of our New Zealand subsidiaries and a $300.0 million sub-facility available to one of our U.K. subsidiaries.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P260_S3	Additionally, outstanding borrowings under these sub-facilities may be up to 5.0% higher as allowed under the currency fluctuation provision in the 2015 Credit Agreement.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P261_S0	Borrowings under the new revolving credit facility bear interest at varying rates, based at our option, on either the applicable fixed rate plus 1.175% to 1.50% or the daily rate plus 0.175% to 0.50% as determined by reference to our ratio of total debt less available cash to EBITDA (as defined in the 2015 Credit Agreement).
1138118_15_ITEM8_P261_S1	Borrowings under the new tranche A term loan facility bear interest, based on our option, on either the applicable fixed rate plus 1.375% to 1.85% or the daily rate plus 0.375% to 0.85%, as determined by reference to our ratio of total debt less available cash to EBITDA (as defined in the 2015 Credit Agreement).
1138118_15_ITEM8_P261_S2	The 2015 Credit Agreement is jointly and severally guaranteed by us and substantially all of our material domestic subsidiaries.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P261_S3	Borrowings under the 2015 Credit Agreement are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the capital stock of our U.S. subsidiaries and 65.0% of the capital stock of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, in each case, held by CBRE and the U.S. guarantor subsidiaries.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P261_S4	Also, the 2015 Credit Agreement requires us to pay a fee based on the total amount of the unused revolving credit facility commitment.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P261_S5	In January 2015, proceeds from the tranche A term loan facility under the 2015 Credit Agreement and from the $125.0 million of 5.25% senior notes due 2025 issued in December 2014, along with cash on hand, were used to pay off the prior tranche A and tranche B term loans and the previously outstanding balance under our 2013 Credit Agreement.
1138118_15_ITEM8_P262_S0	(1) EPS is defined as earnings per share.
1138118_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Securities Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f), including maintenance of (i) records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets, and (ii) policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance that (a) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, (b) our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our Board of Directors and (c) we will prevent or timely detect unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1138118_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control.
1138118_15_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses of judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.
1138118_15_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper overriding of controls.
1138118_15_ITEM9A_P1_S3	As a result of such limitations, there is risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
1138118_15_ITEM9A_P1_S4	However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
1138118_15_ITEM9A_P1_S5	Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
1138118_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission.
1138118_15_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Based on our evaluation under the COSO framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2014.
1138118_15_ITEM9A_P2_S2	The effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.
1138118_15_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Disclosure Controls and Procedures Rule 13a-15 of the Securities and Exchange Act requires that we conduct an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report, and we have a disclosure policy in furtherance of the same.
1138118_15_ITEM9A_P3_S1	This evaluation is designed to ensure that all corporate disclosure is complete and accurate in all material respects.
1138118_15_ITEM9A_P3_S2	The evaluation is further designed to ensure that all information required to be disclosed in our SEC reports is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods and in the manner specified in the SEC s rules and forms.

(the Company ), hereby certify as of the date hereof, solely for the purposes of 18 U.S.C. 1350, that: (i) the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2014, of the Company (the Report ) fully complies with the requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d), as applicable, of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and (ii) the information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company at the dates and for the periods indicated.
1138118_15_ITEM15_P25_S0	The foregoing certification is being furnished solely pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 1350 and is not being filed as part of the Report or as a separate disclosure document.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P0_S0	CBRE Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, (which may be referred to in this Form 10-K as the company, we, us and our ), is the world s largest commercial real estate services and investment firm, based on 2015 revenue, with leading full-service operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P0_S1	We offer a full range of services to occupiers, owners, lenders and investors in office, retail, industrial, multifamily and other types of commercial real estate.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P0_S2	As of December 31, 2015, excluding independent affiliates, we operated in more than 400 offices worldwide, with more than 70,000 employees providing commercial real estate services under the CBRE brand name, investment management services under the CBRE Global Investors brand name and development services under the Trammell Crow Company brand name.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P0_S3	Our business is focused on several competencies, including commercial property, corporate facilities, project and transaction management, tenant/occupier and property/agency leasing, capital markets solutions (property sales, commercial mortgage origination, sales and servicing, and structured finance), real estate investment management, valuation, development services and proprietary research.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P0_S4	We generate revenues from both management fees (large multi-year portfolio and per-project contracts) and from commissions on transactions.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P0_S5	Our contractual, fee-for-services businesses generally involve property and facilities management, mortgage loan servicing, investment management and appraisal/valuation.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P0_S6	In addition, our leasing services have contractual elements and work for clients in this service line is often recurring in nature.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P0_S7	Our revenue mix has shifted in recent years toward more contractual revenue as occupiers and investors increasingly prefer to purchase integrated, account-based services from firms that meet their broad needs in local markets nationally and globally.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P0_S8	We believe we are well-positioned to capture a growing share of this business.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P0_S9	In 2015, we generated revenue from a well-balanced, highly diversified base of clients, including more than 90 of the Fortune 100 companies.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P0_S10	We have been included in the Fortune 500 since 2008 and among the Fortune Most Admired Companies in the real estate sector for four consecutive years.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P0_S11	In 2015, we were ranked second among all companies on the Barron s 500, which evaluates companies on growth and financial performance.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P0_S12	Additionally, the International Association of Outsourcing Professionals (IAOP) has ranked us among the top few outsourcing service providers across all industries for five consecutive years.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P1_S0	CBRE History CBRE marked its 109th year of continuous operations in 2015, tracing our origins to a company founded in San Francisco in the aftermath of the 1906 earthquake.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P1_S1	Since then, we have grown into the largest global commercial real estate services and investment firm (in terms of 2015 revenue) through organic growth and a series of strategic acquisitions.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P1_S2	Among these acquisitions are the purchases of Trammell Crow Company (December 2006); ING Group N.V. s Real Estate Investment Management (REIM) operations in Europe and Asia (October 2011) and its U.S.-based global real estate listed securities business (July 2011); and Norland Managed Services Ltd (December 2013).
1138118_16_ITEM1_P1_S3	In addition, CBRE acquired the Global Workplace Solutions (GWS) business from Johnson Controls, Inc. in September 2015.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P1_S4	GWS is a leading provider of enterprise facilities management services worldwide.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P2_S0	Our Regions of Operation and Principal Services CBRE Group, Inc. is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its indirect subsidiaries.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P2_S1	CBRE Services, Inc., our direct wholly-owned subsidiary, is also generally a holding company and is the primary obligor or issuer with respect to most of our long-term indebtedness.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P2_S2	We report our operations through the following segments: (1) Americas; (2) Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA; (3) Asia Pacific; (4) Global Investment Management; and (5) Development Services.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P3_S0	Information regarding revenue and operating income or loss, attributable to each of our segments, is included in Segment Operations within the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section and within Note 18 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by reference.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P3_S1	Information concerning the identifiable assets of each of our business segments is also set forth in Note 18 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P4_S0	The Americas The Americas is our largest reporting segment, comprised of operations throughout the United States and Canada as well as key markets in Latin America.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P4_S1	Our operations are largely wholly-owned, but also include independent affiliates to whom we license the CBRE name in their local markets in return for payments of annual or quarterly royalty fees to us and an agreement to cross-refer business between us and the affiliate.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P4_S2	Most of our operations are conducted through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE, Inc.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P4_S3	Our mortgage loan origination, sales and servicing operations are conducted exclusively through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary operating under the name CBRE Capital Markets, Inc., or Capital Markets, and its subsidiaries.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P4_S4	Our operations in Canada are conducted through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE Limited and our operations in Latin America are operated through various indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P4_S5	Our Americas segment accounted for 57.0% of our 2015 revenue, 57.5% of our 2014 revenue and 62.7% of our 2013 revenue.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P4_S6	Within our Americas segment, we organize our services into several business lines, as further described below.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P4_S7	Our advisory services businesses offer occupier/tenant and investor/owner services that meet the full spectrum of marketplace needs, including: (1) real estate leasing services; (2) capital markets; and (3) valuation.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P4_S8	Our advisory services business line accounted for 31.1% of our 2015 consolidated worldwide revenue, 32.5% of our 2014 consolidated worldwide revenue and 34.8% of our 2013 consolidated worldwide revenue.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P4_S9	Within advisory services, our major service lines are the following:
1138118_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	We provide strategic advice and execution to owners, investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with leasing (the majority of our revenues), disposition and acquisition of property.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P5_S1	We generate significant repeat business from existing clients, which, for example, accounted for approximately 64% of our U.S. sales and leasing revenue in 2015, including referrals from other parts of our business.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P5_S2	We believe we are a market leader for the provision of real estate services in most top U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau), including Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia and Phoenix.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P5_S3	Our real estate services professionals are compensated primarily through commission-based programs, which are payable upon completion of an assignment.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P5_S4	This gives us flexibility to mitigate the negative effect of compensation, our largest expense, on our operating margins during difficult market conditions.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P5_S5	We strive to retain top professionals through an attractive compensation program tied to productivity as well as greater investments in support resources, including professional development and training, market research and information, technology, branding and marketing, than most other firms in our sector.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P5_S6	We further strengthen our relationships with our real estate services clients by offering proprietary research to them through CBRE Research and CBRE Econometric Advisors, our commercial real estate market information and forecasting groups.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	We offer clients fully integrated investment sales and debt/structured financing services under the CBRE Capital Markets brand.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P6_S1	The tight integration of these services helps to meet marketplace demand for comprehensive capital markets solutions.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P6_S2	During 2015, we concluded approximately $128.6 billion of capital markets transactions in the Americas, including $88.7 billion of investment sales transactions and $39.9 billion of mortgage loan originations and sales.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	CBRE is the leading investment sales property advisor in the United States, with a market share of approximately 16.5% in 2015 across office, industrial, retail, multifamily and hotel properties according to Real Capital Analytics.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	Our mortgage brokerage business originates, sells and services commercial mortgage loans primarily through relationships established with investment banking firms, national banks, credit companies, insurance companies, pension funds and government agencies.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P8_S1	In the United States, our mortgage loan origination volume in 2015 was $33.7 billion, including approximately $12.6 billion for U.S. federal government-sponsored entities (GSEs).
1138118_16_ITEM1_P8_S2	Most of the GSE loans were financed through our revolving credit lines dedicated exclusively for this purpose and were substantially risk mitigated by either obtaining a contractual purchase commitment from the GSE or confirming a forward-trade commitment for the issuance and purchase of a mortgage-backed security that will be secured by the loan.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P8_S3	We advised on the sale of approximately $5.7 billion of mortgages on behalf of financial institutions in 2015.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P8_S4	CBRE also operates a loan servicing portfolio, which totaled approximately $108.9 billion in the Americas at year-end 2015.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	We provide valuation services that include market value appraisals, litigation support, discounted cash flow analyses, feasibility and fairness opinions as well as consulting services such as property condition reports, hotel advisory and environmental consulting.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	Our valuation business has developed proprietary systems for data management, analysis and valuation report preparation, which we believe provide us with an advantage over our competitors.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P10_S1	We believe that our valuation business is one of the largest in the industry.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P10_S2	During 2015, we completed over 53,000 valuation, appraisal and advisory assignments in the Americas.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	The outsourcing of commercial real estate services is believed to be a long-term trend in our industry, with property owners and occupiers seeking better execution and improved efficiency by relying on the expertise of third-party real estate specialists.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P11_S1	Two of our business lines capitalize on the outsourcing trend: (1) occupier outsourcing, which we provide for corporations, public sector entities, health care providers and others; and (2) asset services, which we provide for property owners.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P11_S2	As of December 31, 2015, we managed approximately 2.3 billion square feet of commercial property and facilities in the Americas.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P11_S3	Our outsourcing services business line accounted for 25.9% of our 2015 consolidated worldwide revenue, 25.0% of our 2014 consolidated worldwide revenue and 27.9% of our 2013 consolidated worldwide revenue.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	Through our Global Workplace Solutions business line, we provide a comprehensive suite of services to occupiers of real estate, including facilities management, project management, advisory and transaction services and strategic consulting.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P12_S1	We typically enter into multi-year, multi-service outsourcing contracts with our clients, but also provide services on a one-off assignment or a short-term contract basis.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	Facilities management involves the day-to-day management of client-occupied space and includes headquarter buildings, regional offices, administrative offices, data centers and other critical facilities, manufacturing and laboratory facilities, distribution facilities and retail space.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P13_S1	Contracts for facilities management services are typically structured so we receive reimbursement of client-dedicated personnel costs and associated overhead expenses plus a monthly fee, and in some cases, annual incentives if agreed-upon performance targets are satisfied.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	Project management services are typically provided on a portfolio-wide or programmatic basis.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P14_S1	Revenues for project management generally include fixed management fees, variable fees, and incentive fees if certain agreed-upon performance targets are met.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P14_S2	Revenues for project management may also include reimbursement of payroll and related costs for personnel providing the services.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	We provide asset services (also called property management services) on a contractual basis for owners/investors in office, industrial and retail properties.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P15_S1	These services include construction management, marketing, building engineering, accounting and financial services.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	cases, the greater of such percentage fee or a minimum agreed-upon fee.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P16_S1	We are also often reimbursed for our administrative and payroll costs, as well as certain out-of-pocket expenses, directly attributable to the properties under management.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P16_S2	Our management agreements with our asset services clients, which are owners/investors in real estate, may be terminated by either party with notice generally ranging between 30 to 90 days; however, we have developed long-term relationships with many of these clients and the typical contract continues for multiple years.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P16_S3	We believe our contractual relationships with these clients put us in an advantageous position to provide other services to them, including leasing, refinancing, disposition and appraisal.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) Our Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, reporting segment operates in 43 countries.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P17_S1	The largest operations are located in France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P17_S2	Our operations in these countries generally provide a full range of services to the commercial property sector.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P17_S3	Additionally, we provide some residential property services, focused on the prime and super-prime segments of the market, primarily in the United Kingdom.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P17_S4	Within EMEA, our services are organized along similar lines as in the Americas, including leasing, property sales, valuation services, asset management services and occupier outsourcing, among others.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P17_S5	Our EMEA segment accounted for 27.7% of our 2015 revenue, 25.9% of our 2014 revenue and 16.9% of our 2013 revenue.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	In several countries in EMEA, we have contractual relationships with independent affiliates that provide commercial real estate services under our brand name.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P18_S1	Our agreements with these independent affiliates include licenses by us to them to use the CBRE name in the relevant territory in return for payments of annual or quarterly royalty fees to us.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P18_S2	In addition, these agreements may include business cross-referral arrangements between us and our affiliates.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	Asia Pacific Our Asia Pacific reporting segment operates in 14 countries.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P19_S1	We believe that we are one of only a few companies that can provide a full range of real estate services to large occupiers and investors throughout the region, similar to the broad range of services provided by our Americas and EMEA segments.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	Our primary operations in Asia are located in Greater China, India, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P20_S1	In addition, we have contractual agreements with independent affiliates that generate royalty fees and support cross-referral arrangements similar to our EMEA segment.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	The Pacific region includes Australia and New Zealand.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P21_S1	Our Asia Pacific segment accounted for 10.5% of our 2015 revenue, 10.7% of our 2014 revenue and 12.1% of our 2013 revenue.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	Global Investment Management Operations in our Global Investment Management reporting segment are conducted through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE Global Investors, LLC and its global affiliates, which we also refer to as CBRE Global Investors.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	CBRE Global Investors provides investment management services to pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, foundations, endowments and other institutional investors seeking to generate returns and diversification through investment in real estate.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P23_S1	It sponsors investment programs that span the risk/return spectrum in: North America, Europe, Asia and Australia.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P23_S2	In some strategies, CBRE Global Investors and its investment teams co-invest with its limited partners.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P23_S3	CBRE Global Investors offerings are organized into four primary categories: (1) direct real estate investments through sponsored funds; (2) direct real estate investments through separate accounts; (3) indirect real estate investments through listed securities; and (4) indirect real estate investments through multi-manager investment programs.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	Assets under management have increased from $17.3 billion at December 31, 2005 to $89.0 billion at December 31, 2015.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P24_S1	Our Global Investment Management segment accounted for 4.2% of our 2015 revenue, 5.2% of our 2014 revenue and 7.5% of our 2013 revenue.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	Development Services Operations in our Development Services reporting segment are conducted through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Trammell Crow Company, LLC and certain of its subsidiaries, providing development services primarily in the United States to users of and investors in commercial real estate, as well as for its own account.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P25_S1	Trammell Crow Company pursues opportunistic, risk-mitigated development and investment in commercial real estate across a wide spectrum of property types, including: industrial, office and retail properties; healthcare facilities of all types (medical office buildings, hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers); and residential/mixed-use projects.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P25_S2	Our Development Services segment accounted for 0.6% of our 2015 revenue, 0.7% of our 2014 revenue and 0.7% of our 2013 revenue.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	Trammell Crow Company pursues development and investment activity on behalf of its user and investor clients (with no ownership), in partnership with its clients (through co-investment either on an individual project basis or through programs with certain strategic capital partners) or for its own account (100% ownership).
1138118_16_ITEM1_P26_S1	Development activity in which Trammell Crow Company has an ownership interest is conducted through subsidiaries that are consolidated or unconsolidated for financial reporting purposes, depending primarily on the extent and nature of our ownership interest.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P26_S2	At December 31, 2015, Trammell Crow Company had $6.7 billion of development projects in process.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P26_S3	Additionally, the inventory of pipeline deals (prospective projects we believe have a greater than 50% chance of closing or where land has been acquired and the projected construction start date is more than twelve months out) was $3.6 billion at December 31, 2015.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	Competition We compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate industry, including commercial property, corporate facilities, project and transaction management, occupier and property/agency leasing, property sales, valuation, real estate investment management, commercial mortgage origination, sales and servicing, capital markets (structured finance) solutions, development services and proprietary research.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P27_S1	Each business discipline is highly competitive on an international, national, regional and local level.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P27_S2	Although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2015 revenue, our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographic markets, property types and services.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P27_S3	We face competition from other commercial real estate service providers that compete with us on a global, national, regional or local basis or within a market segment; outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have expanded their offerings from time to time; in-house corporate real estate departments and property owners/developers that self-perform real estate services; investment banking firms, investment managers and developers that compete with us to raise and place investment capital; and accounting/consulting firms that advise on real estate strategies.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P27_S4	Some of these firms may have greater financial resources than we do.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	Despite recent consolidation, the commercial real estate services industry remains highly fragmented and competitive.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P28_S1	Although many of our competitors are substantially smaller than us, some of them are larger on a regional or local basis or have a stronger position in a specific market segment or service offering.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P29_S0	parent of Newmark Grubb Knight Frank); market-segment specialists, such as Eastdil Secured, HFF, L.P. and Marcus Millichap, Inc.; and firms with business lines that compete with our occupier outsourcing business.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P30_S0	Seasonality A significant portion of our revenue is seasonal, which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P31_S0	Historically, our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flow from operating activities tend to be lowest in the first calendar quarter, and highest in the fourth calendar quarter of each year.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P31_S1	Earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales, financing and leasing transactions prior to calendar year-end.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P31_S2	At December 31, 2015, excluding our independent affiliates, we had more than 70,000 employees worldwide, approximately 37% of which represent costs that are fully reimbursed by clients and are mostly in our outsourcing services lines of business.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P31_S3	At December 31, 2015, approximately 1,900 of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements, most of whom are on-site employees in our asset services business in California, Illinois, New Jersey and New York.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	We hold various trademarks and trade names worldwide, which include the CBRE name.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P32_S1	Although we believe our intellectual property plays a role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve, we do not believe we would be materially, adversely affected by expiration or termination of our trademarks or trade names or the loss of any of our other intellectual property rights other than the CBRE and Trammell Crow Company names.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	We maintain trademark registrations for the CBRE service mark in jurisdictions where we conduct significant business.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P33_S1	We hold a license to use the Trammell Crow Company trade name pursuant to a license agreement with CF98, L.P., an affiliate of Crow Realty Investors, L.P., d/b/a Crow Holdings, which may be revoked if we fail to satisfy usage and quality control covenants under the license agreement.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	In addition to trade names, we have developed proprietary technologies for the provision of complex services and analysis through our global outsourcing business and for preparing and developing valuation reports for our clients through our valuation business.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P34_S1	We also offer proprietary research to clients through our CBRE-EA research unit and we offer proprietary investment analysis and structures through CBRE Global Investors.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	We have not generally registered these items of intellectual property in any jurisdiction.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P35_S1	While we may seek to secure our rights under applicable intellectual property protection laws in these and any other proprietary assets that we use in our business, we do not believe any of these other items of intellectual property are material to our business in the aggregate.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	Environmental Matters Federal, state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business impose environmental liabilities, controls, disclosure rules and zoning restrictions that affect the ownership, management, development, use or sale of commercial real estate.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P36_S1	Certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability on current or previous real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating, cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property, including contamination resulting from above-ground or underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos or lead at a property.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P37_S0	without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P38_S0	The operator of a site also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from exposure to hazardous substances or environmental contamination at a site, including liabilities arising from exposure to asbestos-containing materials.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	Under certain laws and common law principles, any failure by us to disclose environmental contamination at a property could subject us to liability to a buyer or lessee of the property.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P39_S1	Further, federal, state and local governments in the countries in which we do business have enacted various laws, regulations and treaties governing environmental and climate change, particularly for greenhouse gases, which seek to tax, penalize or limit their release.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P39_S2	Such regulations could lead to increased operational or compliance costs over time.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	While we are aware of the presence or the potential presence of regulated substances in the soil or groundwater at or near several properties owned, operated or managed by us that may have resulted from historical or ongoing activities on those properties, we are not aware of any material noncompliance with the environmental laws or regulations currently applicable to us, and we are not the subject of any material claim for liability with respect to contamination at any location.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P40_S1	However, these laws and regulations may discourage sales and leasing activities and mortgage lending with respect to some properties, which may adversely affect both the commercial real estate services industry and us in general.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P40_S2	Environmental contamination or other environmental liabilities may also negatively affect the value of commercial real estate assets held by entities that are managed by our investment management and development services businesses, which could adversely affect the results of operations of these business lines.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P40_S3	We use our website as a channel of distribution for Company information, and financial and other material information regarding us is routinely posted and accessible on our website.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	On the Investor Relations page on our website, we post the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC: our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P41_S1	We also make available through our website other reports filed with or furnished to the SEC under the Exchange Act, including reports filed by our officers and directors under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P41_S2	All of the information on our Investor Relations web page is available to be viewed free of charge.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P41_S3	Information contained on our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or our other filings with the SEC.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P41_S4	We assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless we are required to do so by law.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P41_S5	A copy of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is available without charge upon written request to: Investor Relations, CBRE Group, Inc., 200 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10166.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P41_S6	The SEC also maintains an Internet site (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	Item 1A. Risk Factors Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report and other public statements we make.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P42_S1	Based on the information currently known to us, we believe that the matters discussed below identify the material risk factors affecting our business.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P42_S2	However, the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial (but that later become material) may also adversely affect our business.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P43_S1	The success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and, accordingly, our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by economic slowdowns, liquidity crises, fiscal uncertainty and possible subsequent downturns in commercial real estate asset values, property sales and leasing activities in one or more of the geographies or industry sectors that we or our clients serve.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P43_S2	Periods of economic weakness or recession, significantly rising interest rates, fiscal uncertainty, declining employment levels, declining demand for commercial real estate, falling real estate values, disruption to the global capital or credit markets or the public perception that any of these events may occur, may negatively affect the performance of some or all of our business lines.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P43_S3	Our business is significantly affected by generally prevailing economic conditions in the markets where we principally operate, which can result in a general decline in real estate acquisition, disposition and leasing activity, as well as a general decline in the value of commercial real estate and in rents, which in turn reduces revenue from asset services fees and commissions derived from property sales, leasing, valuation and financing, as well as revenues associated with development or investment management activities.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P43_S4	Our businesses could also suffer from any political or economic disruption that affects interest rates or liquidity.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P43_S5	Adverse economic conditions could also lead to a decline in property sales prices as well as a decline in funds invested in existing commercial real estate assets and properties planned for development, which in turn could reduce the commissions and fees that we earn.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P43_S6	In addition, our development and investment strategy often entails making co-investments alongside our investor clients.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P43_S7	During an economic downturn, capital for our investment activities is usually constrained and it may take longer for us to dispose of real estate investments or selling prices may be lower than originally anticipated.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P43_S8	As a result, the value of our commercial real estate investments may be reduced, and we could realize losses or diminished profitability.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P43_S9	In addition, economic downturns may reduce the amount of loan originations and related servicing by our Capital Markets business.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	The performance of our asset services line of business depends upon how well the properties we manage perform.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P44_S1	This is because our fees are generally based on a percentage of rent collections from these properties.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	Rent collections may be affected by many factors, including: (i) real estate and financial market conditions prevailing generally and locally; (ii) our ability to attract and retain creditworthy tenants, particularly during economic downturns; and (iii) the magnitude of defaults by tenants under their respective leases, which may increase during distressed economic conditions.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	Certain geographies within the Americas, as well as certain industry sectors that we serve, have been negatively affected by the recent weakened performance of the oil and gas industry, which may in turn diminish the performance of our various businesses in those geographies as well as reduce the demand for our services by our clients in such areas or who are affected by that industry.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	In continental Europe, the economic recovery is slow and fragile.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P47_S1	If recovery in certain European economies stalls, our performance may be adversely affected.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P47_S2	In addition, China s deteriorating macro-economic environment could adversely affect our operations in our Asia Pacific segment, which may adversely affect our financial performance.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P47_S3	Economic uncertainty as well as significant changes and volatility in the financial markets and business environment, and in the global landscape, make it increasingly difficult for us to predict our financial performance into the future.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P47_S4	As a result, any guidance or outlook that we provide on our performance is based on then-current conditions, and there is a risk that such guidance may turn out to be inaccurate.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	Adverse developments in the credit markets may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	Additionally, the revenues in all of our businesses are dependent to some extent on the overall volume of activity (and pricing) in the commercial real estate market.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	Disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business of providing advisory services to owners, investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with the leasing, disposition and acquisition of property.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P50_S1	If our clients are unable to procure credit on favorable terms, there may be fewer completed leasing transactions, dispositions and acquisitions of property.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P50_S2	In addition, if purchasers of commercial real estate are not able to procure favorable financing resulting in the lack of disposition opportunities for our funds and projects, our Global Investment Management and Development Services businesses may be unable to generate incentive fees, and we may also experience losses of co-invested equity capital if the disruption causes a permanent decline in the value of investments made.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P50_S3	Our operations are subject to social, political and economic risks in foreign countries as well as foreign currency volatility.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P50_S4	We conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the United States and as a result, we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	During 2015, approximately 45% of our revenue was transacted in foreign currencies, the majority of which included the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, euro, Hong Kong dollar, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Singapore dollar and Swiss franc.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P52_S0	Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may result in corresponding fluctuations in our assets under management for our Global Investment Management business, revenue and earnings.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P52_S1	Over time, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P52_S2	Due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P52_S3	In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P52_S4	Additional circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations include, but are not limited to, the following factors:
1138118_16_ITEM1_P53_S0	foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in certain countries, particularly in Asia Pacific, or the risk that such restrictions will be adopted in the future.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P54_S0	We maintain anti-corruption and anti-money-laundering compliance programs and programs designed to enable us to comply with applicable government economic sanctions, embargoes and other import/export controls throughout the company.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P54_S1	But, coordinating our activities to deal with the broad range of complex legal and regulatory environments in which we operate presents significant challenges.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P54_S2	We may not be successful in complying with regulations in all situations and violations may result in criminal or civil sanctions, including material monetary fines, penalties, equitable remedies (including disgorgement), and other costs against us or our employees, and may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P54_S3	We have committed additional resources to expand our worldwide sales and marketing activities, to globalize our service offerings and products in selected markets and to develop local sales and support channels.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P54_S4	If we are unable to successfully implement these plans, maintain adequate long-term strategies that successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P54_S5	In addition, we have penetrated, and seek to continue to enter into, emerging markets to further expand our global platform.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P54_S6	However, we may not be successful in effectively evaluating and monitoring the key business, operational, legal and compliance risks specific to those markets.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P54_S7	The political and cultural risks present in emerging countries could also harm our ability to successfully execute our operations or manage our businesses there.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P54_S8	Our growth has benefited significantly from acquisitions, which may not perform as expected and similar opportunities may not be available in the future.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P55_S0	A significant component of our growth has been generated by acquisitions.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P55_S1	Any future growth through acquisitions will depend in part upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions, which may not be available to us, as well as sufficient liquidity and credit to fund these acquisitions.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P55_S2	We may incur significant additional debt from time to time to finance any such acquisitions, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our then-existing indebtedness.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P55_S3	If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our then-existing debt, would increase.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P56_S0	Acquisitions involve risks that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired may prove incorrect.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P56_S1	Future acquisitions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transaction-related expenses, which include severance, lease termination, transaction and deferred financing costs, among others.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P57_S0	We have had, and may continue to experience, challenges in integrating operations and information technology systems acquired from other companies.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P57_S1	This could result in the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of our key employees or clients or those of the acquired operations.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P57_S2	The integration process itself may be disruptive to our business and the acquired company s businesses as it requires coordination of geographically diverse organizations and implementation of new accounting and information technology systems.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P58_S0	We believe that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on operating and net income.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P58_S1	Acquisitions also frequently involve significant costs related to integrating information technology, accounting and management services and rationalizing personnel levels.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P58_S2	We complete acquisitions with the expectation that they will result in various benefits, including enhanced or more stable revenues, a strengthened market position, cross-selling opportunities, cost synergies, tax benefits and accretion to our adjusted income per share.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P58_S3	Achieving the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions is subject to a number of uncertainties, including the realization of accretive benefits in the timeframe anticipated and whether we can successfully integrate the acquired business.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P58_S4	Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management s time and energy, which could in turn materially and adversely affect our overall business, financial condition and operating results.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P59_S0	Our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P59_S1	Our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees, including Robert E. Sulentic, our President and Chief Executive Officer.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P59_S2	Mr. Sulentic and certain other key employees are not parties to employment agreements with us.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P59_S3	We also are highly dependent upon the retention of our property sales and leasing professionals, who generate a significant amount of our revenues, as well as other revenue producing professionals.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P59_S4	The departure of any of our key employees, or the loss of a significant number of key revenue producers, if we are unable to quickly hire and integrate qualified replacements, could cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to suffer.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P59_S5	Competition for these personnel is significant and we may not be able to successfully recruit, integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P59_S6	In addition, the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified support personnel in all areas of our business.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P59_S7	We and our competitors use equity incentives and sign-on and retention bonuses to help attract, retain and incentivize key personnel.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P59_S8	As competition is significant for the services of such personnel, the expense of such incentives and bonuses may increase and we may be unable to attract or retain such personnel to the same extent that we have in the past.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P59_S9	Any significant decline in, or failure to grow, our stock price may result in an increased risk of loss of these key personnel.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P59_S10	If we are unable to attract and retain these qualified personnel, our growth may be limited and our business and operating results could suffer.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P59_S11	Our joint venture activities and affiliate program involve unique risks that are often outside of our control and that, if realized, could harm our business.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P59_S12	We have utilized joint ventures for commercial investments, select local brokerage and other affiliations both in the United States and internationally, and we may acquire interests in other joint ventures in the future.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P60_S0	Under our affiliate program, we enter into contractual relationships with local brokerage, asset services or other operations pursuant to which we license to that operation our name and make available certain of our resources, in exchange for a royalty or economic participation in that operation s revenue, profits or transactional activity.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P60_S1	In many of these joint ventures and affiliations, we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures or affiliates, and other participants or operators of affiliates may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P60_S2	In addition, the other participants and operators may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P60_S3	If a joint venture participant or affiliate acts contrary to our interest, it could harm our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P60_S4	Our real estate investment and co-investment activities in our Global Investment Management as well as Development Services businesses subject us to real estate investment risks which could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flow.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P60_S5	An important part of the strategy for our Global Investment Management business involves co-investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients, and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P60_S6	As of December 31, 2015, we had committed $12.8 million to fund future co-investments in our Global Investment Management business, $8.8 million of which is expected to be funded during 2016.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P60_S7	In addition to required future capital contributions, some of the co-investment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P60_S8	The failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments, including damage to our reputation with our co-investment partners and clients, as well as the necessity of obtaining alternative funding from other sources that may be on disadvantageous terms for us and the other co-investors.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P60_S9	Participating as a co-investor is an important part of our Global Investment Management business, which might suffer if we were unable to make these investments.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P61_S0	Although our debt instruments contain restrictions that limit our ability to provide capital to the entities holding direct or indirect interests in co-investments, we may provide this capital in many instances in further support of the co-investment.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P62_S0	Selective investment in real estate projects is an important part of our Development Services business strategy, and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P62_S1	As of December 31, 2015, we had 10 consolidated real estate projects with invested equity of $9.1 million.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P63_S0	involved as a principal (in most cases, co-investing with our clients) in approximately 60 unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries with invested equity of $121.9 million and had committed additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries of $29.6 million.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P63_S1	As of December 31, 2015, we also guaranteed outstanding notes payable of these unconsolidated subsidiaries with outstanding balances of $12.4 million.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P64_S0	During the ordinary course of our Development Services business, we provide numerous completion and budget guarantees requiring us to complete the relevant project within a specified timeframe and/or within a specified budget, with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P64_S1	While we generally have guaranteed maximum price contracts with reputable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees (which are intended to pass most of the risk to such contractors), there can be no assurance that we will not have to perform under any such guarantees.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P64_S2	If we are required to perform under a significant number of such guarantees, it could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P65_S0	Because the disposition of a single significant investment can affect our financial performance in any period, our real estate investment activities could cause fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flow.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P65_S1	In many cases, we have limited control over the timing of the disposition of these investments and the recognition of any related gain or loss, or incentive participation fee.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P65_S2	Poor performance of the investment programs that our Global Investment Management business manages would cause a decline in our revenue, net income and cash flow and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future programs.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P66_S0	The revenue, net income and cash flow generated by our Global Investment Management business can be volatile period over period, primarily due to the fact that management, transaction and incentive fees can vary as a result of market movements from one period to another.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P66_S1	In the event that any of the investment programs that our Global Investment Management business manages were to perform poorly, our revenue, net income and cash flow could decline because the value of the assets we manage would decrease, which would result in a reduction in some of our management fees, and our investment returns would decrease, resulting in a reduction in the incentive compensation we earn.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P66_S2	Moreover, we could experience losses on co-investments of our own capital in such programs as a result of poor performance.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P66_S3	Investors and potential investors in our programs continually assess our performance, and our ability to raise capital for existing and future programs and maintaining our current fee structure will depend on our continued satisfactory performance.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P66_S4	Our debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us, and in the event of a default, all of our borrowings would become immediately due and payable.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P66_S5	We have debt and related debt service obligations.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P66_S6	As of December 31, 2015, our total debt, excluding notes payable on real estate (which are generally nonrecourse to us) and warehouse lines of credit (which are recourse only to our wholly-owned subsidiary, CBRE Capital Markets, and are secured by our related warehouse receivables), was approximately $2.7 billion.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P66_S7	For the year ended December 31, 2015, our interest expense was approximately $118.9 million.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P66_S8	Our debt instruments, including our credit agreement, impose, and the terms of any future debt may impose, operating and other restrictions on us and many of our subsidiaries.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P66_S9	These restrictions affect, and in many respects limit or prohibit, our ability to:
1138118_16_ITEM1_P67_S0	finance ongoing operations, strategic acquisitions, investments or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest, including:
1138118_16_ITEM1_P68_S0	Our credit agreement currently requires us to maintain a minimum coverage ratio of EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) to total interest expense of 2.00x and a maximum leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) of 4.25x as of the end of each fiscal quarter.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P68_S1	Our coverage ratio of EBITDA to total interest expense was 11.81x for the year ended December 31, 2015, and our leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to EBITDA was 1.45x as of December 31, 2015.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P68_S2	Our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot give assurance that we will be able to meet those ratios when required.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P68_S3	We continue to monitor our projected compliance with these financial ratios and other terms of our credit agreement.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P68_S4	A breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our debt instruments.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P68_S5	If any such default occurs, the lenders under our credit agreement may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P68_S6	The lenders under our credit agreement also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P68_S7	In addition, a default under our credit agreement could trigger a cross default or cross acceleration under our other debt instruments.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P68_S8	Our credit agreement is jointly and severally guaranteed by us and substantially all of our material domestic subsidiaries.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P68_S9	We have limited restrictions on the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur, which may intensify the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our indebtedness.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P68_S10	In addition, in the event of a credit-ratings downgrade, our ability to borrow and the costs of that borrowing could be adversely affected.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P68_S11	Subject to the maximum amounts of indebtedness permitted by our credit agreement covenants, we are not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur, and so we may in the future incur such indebtedness in order to finance our operations and investments.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P68_S12	In addition, Moody s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard Poor s Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., rate our significant outstanding debt.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P68_S13	These ratings, and any downgrades of them, may affect our ability to borrow as well as the costs of our current and future borrowings.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P69_S0	We are subject to various litigation risks and may face financial liabilities and/or damage to our reputation as a result of litigation.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P70_S0	Our businesses are exposed to various litigation risks.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P70_S1	In addition, although we maintain insurance coverage for most of this risk, insurance coverage is unavailable at commercially reasonable pricing for certain types of exposures.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P70_S2	Accordingly, an adverse result in a litigation against us, or a lawsuit that results in a substantial legal liability for us (and particularly a lawsuit that is not insured), could have a disproportionate and material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P70_S3	In addition, we depend on our business relationships and our reputation for high-caliber professional services to attract and retain clients.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P70_S4	As a result, allegations against us, irrespective of the ultimate outcome of that allegation, may harm our professional reputation and as such materially damage our business and its prospects.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P70_S5	Failure to maintain and execute information technology strategies and ensure that our employees adapt to changes in technology could materially and adversely affect our ability to remain competitive in the market.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P71_S0	Our business relies heavily on information technology to deliver services that meet the needs of our clients.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P71_S1	If we are unable to effectively execute our information technology strategies or adopt new technologies and processes relevant to our service platform, our ability to deliver high-quality services may be materially impaired.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P71_S2	In addition, we make significant investments in new systems and tools to achieve competitive advantages and efficiencies.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P71_S3	Implementation of such investments in information technology could exceed estimated budgets and we may experience challenges that prevent new strategies or technologies from being realized according to anticipated schedules.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P71_S4	If we are unable to maintain current information technology and processes or encounter delays, or fail to exploit new technologies, then the execution of our business plans may be disrupted.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P71_S5	Similarly, our employees require effective tools and techniques to perform functions integral to our business.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P71_S6	Failure to successfully provide such tools and systems, or ensure that employees have properly adopted them, could materially and adversely impact our ability to achieve positive business outcomes.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P71_S7	Failure to maintain the security of our information and technology networks, including personally identifiable and client information, intellectual property and proprietary business information could significantly adversely affect us.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P71_S8	Security breaches and other disruptions of our information and technology networks could compromise our information and intellectual property and expose us to liability, reputational harm and significant remediation costs, which could cause material harm to our business and financial results.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P72_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and intellectual property, and that of our clients and personally identifiable information of our employees and contractors, in our data centers and on our networks.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P72_S1	The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information are critical to our operations.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P72_S2	Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by third parties or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P72_S3	A significant actual or potential theft, loss, corruption, exposure, fraudulent use or misuse of client, employee or other personally identifiable or proprietary business data, whether by third parties or as a result of employee malfeasance or otherwise, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or intellectual property or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could result in significant remediation and other costs, fines, litigation or regulatory actions against us.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P72_S4	Such an event could additionally disrupt our operations and the services we provide to clients, damage our reputation, result in the loss of a competitive advantage, impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial data and cause a loss of confidence in our services and financial reporting, which could adversely affect our business, revenues, competitive position and investor confidence.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P72_S5	Additionally, we increasingly rely on third-party data storage providers, including cloud storage solution providers, resulting in less direct control over our data.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P72_S6	Such third parties are also vulnerable to security breaches and compromised security systems, for which we may not be indemnified and which could materially adversely affect us and our reputation.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P73_S0	Interruption or failure of our information technology, communications systems or data services could impair our ability to provide our services effectively, which could damage our reputation and materially harm our operating results.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P73_S1	Our business requires the continued operation of information technology and communication systems and network infrastructure.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P73_S2	Our ability to conduct our global business may be materially adversely affected by disruptions to these systems or infrastructure.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P73_S3	Our information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or disruption from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, system malfunctions, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and floods, acts of war or terrorism, employee errors or malfeasance, or other events which are beyond our control.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P73_S4	In addition, the operation and maintenance of these systems and networks is in some cases dependent on third-party technologies, systems and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P73_S5	Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays and loss, corruption or exposure of critical data or intellectual property and may also disrupt our ability to provide services to or interact with our clients, and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication or travel.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P73_S6	Furthermore, any such event could result in substantial recovery and remediation costs and liability to customers, business partners and other third parties.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P73_S7	We have disaster recovery plans and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events, but our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient and cannot account for all eventualities, and a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations, and as a result, our future operating results could be materially adversely affected.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P73_S8	The infrastructure disruptions we describe above may also disrupt our ability to manage real estate for clients or may adversely affect the value of real estate investments we make on behalf of clients.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P74_S0	The buildings we manage for clients, which include some of the world s largest office properties and retail centers, are used by numerous people daily.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P74_S1	As a result, fires, earthquakes, floods, other natural disasters, defects and terrorist attacks can result in significant loss of life, and, to the extent we are held to have been negligent in connection with our management of the affected properties, we could incur significant financial liabilities and reputational harm.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P75_S0	Our business relies heavily on the use of commercial real estate data.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P75_S1	A portion of this data is purchased or licensed from third-party providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P75_S2	A disruption of our ability to provide data to our professionals and/or our clients or an inadvertent exposure of proprietary data could damage our reputation and competitive position, and our operating results could be adversely affected.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P75_S3	We have numerous local and global competitors across all of our business lines and the geographies that we serve, and further industry consolidation could lead to significant future competition.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P75_S4	We compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate services and investment industry, including commercial property and corporate facilities management, occupier and property/agency leasing, property sales, valuation, real estate investment management, commercial mortgage origination and servicing, capital markets (structured finance and debt) solutions, development services and proprietary research.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P75_S5	Although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2015 revenue, our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies, property types and services and business lines.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P75_S6	Depending on the geography, property type or service or business line, we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers and investment firms, including outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have expanded their offerings from time to time, in-house corporate real estate departments, developers, institutional lenders, insurance companies, investment banking firms, investment managers and accounting and consulting firms.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P75_S7	Some of these firms may have greater financial resources allocated to a particular geography, property type or service or business line than we have allocated that geography, property type, service or business line.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P75_S8	In addition, future changes in laws could lead to the entry of other new competitors, such as financial institutions.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P76_S0	We are further subject to competition from large national and multi-national firms that have similar service and investment competencies to ours, and it is possible that further industry consolidation could lead to much larger and more formidable competitors globally or in the particular geographies, property types, service or business lines that we serve.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P76_S1	There is no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively, to maintain current fee levels or margins, or maintain or increase our market share.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P76_S2	Our goodwill and other intangible assets could become impaired, which may require us to take significant non-cash charges against earnings.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P76_S3	Under current accounting guidelines, we must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P76_S4	Any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of such analysis would result in a non-cash charge against earnings, and such charge could materially adversely affect our reported results of operations, stockholders equity and our stock price.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P76_S5	For example, during the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a non-amortizable intangible asset impairment of $98.1 million in our Global Investment Management segment.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P76_S6	This non-cash write-off was related to a decrease in value of our open-end funds, primarily in Europe.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P76_S7	A significant and sustained decline in our future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the economic environment, slower growth rates or if our stock price falls below our net book value per share for a sustained period, could result in the need to perform additional impairment analysis in future periods.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P76_S8	If we were to conclude that a future write-down of goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary, then we would record such additional charges, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P76_S9	A failure to appropriately deal with actual or perceived conflicts of interest could adversely affect our businesses.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P76_S10	Our company has a global platform with different business lines and a broad client base and is therefore subject to numerous potential, actual or perceived conflicts of interests in the provision of services to our existing and potential clients.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P76_S11	For example, conflicts may arise from our position as broker to both owners and tenants in commercial real estate lease transactions.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P76_S12	We have adopted various policies, controls and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts, but these policies and procedures may not be adequate and may not be adhered to by our employees.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P76_S13	Appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged and cause us to lose existing clients or fail to gain new clients if we fail, or appear to fail, to identify, disclose and manage potential conflicts of interest, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P76_S14	In addition, it is possible that in some jurisdictions regulations could be changed to limit our ability to act for parties where conflicts exist even with informed consent, which could limit our market share in those markets.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P77_S0	There can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P77_S1	Our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected by new laws or regulations or by changes in existing laws or regulations or the application thereof.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P77_S2	If we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us, or make incorrect determinations in complex tax regimes, we may incur significant financial penalties.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P77_S3	We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations specific to the services we perform in our business.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P77_S4	Brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions and the provision of asset services and valuation services require us and our employees to maintain applicable licenses in each U.S. state and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we perform these services.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P77_S5	If we and our employees fail to maintain our licenses or conduct these activities without a license, or violate any of the regulations covering our licenses, we may be required to pay fines (including treble damages in certain states) or return commissions received or have our licenses suspended or revoked.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P78_S0	or regulatory action could adversely affect our business.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P78_S1	We could be subject to disciplinary or other actions in the future due to claimed noncompliance with these regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P78_S2	We are also subject to laws of broader applicability, such as tax, securities, environmental and employment laws, including the Fair Labor Standards Act, occupational health and safety regulations and U.S. state wage-and-hour laws.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P78_S3	Failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of significant fines by governmental authorities, awards of damages to private litigants and significant amounts paid in legal fees or settlements of these matters.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P79_S0	We operate in many jurisdictions with complex and varied tax regimes, and are subject to different forms of taxation resulting in a variable effective tax rate.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P79_S1	In addition, from time to time we engage in transactions across different tax jurisdictions.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P80_S0	Due to the different tax laws in the many jurisdictions where we operate, we are often required to make subjective determinations.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P80_S1	The tax authorities in the various jurisdictions where we carry on business may not agree with the determinations that are made by us with respect to the application of tax law.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P80_S2	Such disagreements could result in disputes and, ultimately, in the payment of additional funds to the government authorities in the jurisdictions where we carry on business, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P80_S3	In addition, changes in tax rules or the outcome of tax assessments and audits could have an adverse effect on our results in any particular quarter.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P81_S0	As the size and scope of our business has increased significantly during the past several years, both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with numerous licensing and other regulatory requirements and the possible loss resulting from non-compliance have increased.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P81_S1	The global economic crisis has resulted in increased government and legislative activities, including the introduction of new legislation and changes to rules and regulations, which we expect will continue into the future.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P81_S2	New or revised legislation or regulations applicable to our business, both within and outside of the United States, as well as changes in administrations or enforcement priorities may have an adverse effect on our business, including increasing the costs of regulatory compliance or preventing us from providing certain types of services in certain jurisdictions or in connection with certain transactions or clients.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P81_S3	We are unable to predict how any of these new laws, rules, regulations and proposals will be implemented or in what form, or whether any additional or similar changes to laws or regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, will occur in the future.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P81_S4	Any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P82_S0	We may be subject to environmental liability as a result of our role as a property or facility manager or developer of real estate.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P83_S0	Various laws and regulations impose liability on real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating, cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P83_S1	In our role as a property or facility manager or developer, we could be held liable as an operator for such costs.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P83_S2	This liability may be imposed without regard to the legality of the original actions and without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P83_S3	If we fail to disclose environmental issues, we could also be liable to a buyer or lessee of a property.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P83_S4	If we incur any such liability, our business could suffer significantly as it could be difficult for us to develop or sell such properties, or borrow funds using such properties as collateral.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P83_S5	In the event of a substantial liability, our insurance coverage might be insufficient to pay the full damages, or the scope of available coverage may not cover certain of these liabilities.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P83_S6	Additionally, liabilities incurred to comply with more stringent future environmental requirements could adversely affect any or all of our lines of business.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P84_S0	This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P85_S0	The words anticipate, believe, could, should, propose, continue, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, predict, project, will and similar terms and phrases are used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to identify forward-looking statements.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P85_S1	Except for historical information contained herein, the matters addressed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking statements.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P86_S0	These statements relate to analyses and other information based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P86_S1	These statements also relate to our future prospects, developments and business strategies.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P86_S2	These forward-looking statements are made based on our management s expectations and beliefs concerning future events affecting us and are subject to uncertainties and factors relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P86_S3	These uncertainties and factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those matters expressed in or implied by these forward-looking statements.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P86_S4	The following factors are among those, but are not only those, that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements:
1138118_16_ITEM1_P87_S0	the other factors described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, included under the headings Risk Factors , Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk or as described in the other documents and reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P88_S0	Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P88_S1	You should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P88_S2	We assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking information, except to the extent required by applicable securities laws.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P88_S3	If we do update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.
1138118_16_ITEM1_P88_S4	Additional information concerning these and other risks and uncertainties is contained in our other periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1138118_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	Some of our offices house employees of both our Global Investment Management and Development Services segments as well as employees of our other business segments.
1138118_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	Often, the employees of these segments occupy separate suites in the same building in order to operate the businesses independently with standalone offices.
1138118_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	We have provided above office totals by geographic region and not listed all of our Global Investment Management and Development Services offices to avoid double counting.
1138118_16_ITEM2_P1_S1	In general, these leased offices are fully utilized.
1138118_16_ITEM2_P2_S0	The most significant terms of the leasing arrangements for our offices are the length of the lease and the rent.
1138118_16_ITEM2_P2_S1	Our leases have terms varying in duration.
1138118_16_ITEM2_P2_S2	The rent payable under our office leases varies significantly from location to location as a result of differences in prevailing commercial real estate rates in different geographic locations.
1138118_16_ITEM2_P3_S0	Our management believes that no single office lease is material to our business, results of operations or financial condition.
1138118_16_ITEM2_P3_S1	In addition, we believe there is adequate alternative office space available at acceptable rental rates to meet our needs, although adverse movements in rental rates in some markets may negatively affect our profits in those markets when we enter into new leases.
1138118_16_ITEM2_P3_S2	We do not own any of these offices.
1138118_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	arising out of, or incident to, our ordinary course of business.
1138118_16_ITEM3_P0_S1	We believe that any losses in excess of the amounts accrued therefor as liabilities on our financial statements are unlikely to be significant, but litigation is inherently uncertain and there is the potential for a material adverse effect on our financial statements if one or more matters are resolved in a particular period in an amount materially in excess of what we anticipated.
1138118_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	the last two fiscal years, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange, are set forth below for the periods indicated.
1138118_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	The closing share price for our Class A common stock on December 31, 2015, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange, was $34.58.
1138118_16_ITEM5_P1_S1	As of February 12, 2016, there were 65 stockholders of record of our Class A common stock.
1138118_16_ITEM5_P1_S2	We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on any class of our common stock since our inception on February 20, 2001, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.
1138118_16_ITEM5_P1_S3	We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance future growth and possibly reduce debt.
1138118_16_ITEM5_P1_S4	Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, acquisition or other opportunities to invest capital, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors that the board of directors deems relevant.
1138118_16_ITEM5_P1_S5	In addition, our ability to declare and pay cash dividends is restricted by the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility and senior secured term loan facilities.
1138118_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities None.

1138118_16_ITEM5_P12_S0	The following table sets forth our selected historical consolidated financial information for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_16_ITEM5_P12_S1	The statement of operations data, the statement of cash flows data and the other data for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 and the balance sheet data as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 were derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

1138118_16_ITEM5_P14_S0	Note: We have not declared any cash dividends on common stock for the periods shown.
1138118_16_ITEM5_P15_S0	(1) On September 1, 2015, CBRE, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, closed on a Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement with Johnson Controls, Inc. (JCI) to acquire JCI s Global Workplace Solutions (GWS) business (which we refer to as the GWS Acquisition).
1138118_16_ITEM5_P15_S1	The results for the year ended December 31, 2015 include the operations of GWS from September 1, 2015, the date such business was acquired.
1138118_16_ITEM5_P16_S0	In 2011, we acquired the majority of the real estate investment management business of Netherlands-based ING Group N.V. (ING).
1138118_16_ITEM5_P16_S1	The acquisitions included substantially all of ING s Real Estate Investment Management (REIM) operations in Europe and Asia as well as substantially all of Clarion Real Estate Securities (CRES), its U.S.-based global real estate listed securities business (collectively referred to as ING REIM) along with certain CRES co-investments from ING and additional interests in other funds managed by ING REIM Europe and ING REIM Asia.
1138118_16_ITEM5_P16_S2	On July 1, 2011, we completed the acquisition of CRES for $332.8 million and CRES co-investments from ING for an aggregate amount of $58.6 million.
1138118_16_ITEM5_P16_S3	On October 3, 2011, we completed the acquisition of ING REIM Asia for $45.3 million and three ING REIM Asia co-investments from ING for an aggregate amount of $13.9 million.
1138118_16_ITEM5_P16_S4	On October 31, 2011, we completed the acquisition of ING REIM Europe for $441.5 million and one co-investment from ING for $7.4 million.
1138118_16_ITEM5_P16_S5	During the year ended December 31, 2012, we also funded nine additional co-investments for an aggregate amount of $34.5 million related to ING REIM Europe.
1138118_16_ITEM5_P16_S6	The results for the year ended December 31, 2011 include the operations of CRES, ING REIM Asia and ING REIM Europe from July 1, 2011, October 3, 2011 and October 31, 2011, respectively, the dates each respective business was acquired.
1138118_16_ITEM5_P17_S0	(3) See Income Per Share information in Note 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_16_ITEM5_P18_S0	EBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.
1138118_16_ITEM5_P18_S1	EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and when analyzing our operating performance, investors should use EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP.
1138118_16_ITEM5_P18_S2	Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
1138118_16_ITEM5_P18_S3	We generally use EBITDA to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes, and we believe that this measure provides a more complete understanding of ongoing operations and enhances comparability of current results to prior periods.
1138118_16_ITEM5_P18_S4	We further believe that investors may find EBITDA useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because EBITDA calculations generally eliminate the effects of acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions, the effects of financings and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending.
1138118_16_ITEM5_P19_S0	EBITDA may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.
1138118_16_ITEM5_P20_S0	EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our discretionary use because it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.
1138118_16_ITEM5_P20_S1	EBITDA may also differ from the amount calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which amounts are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
1138118_16_ITEM5_P21_S0	EBITDA is calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_16_ITEM5_P22_S0	In the third quarter of 2015, we elected to early adopt the provisions of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-03, Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.
1138118_16_ITEM5_P22_S1	This ASU requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability instead of separately being recorded in other assets.
1138118_16_ITEM5_P22_S2	As of December 31, 2014, deferred financing costs totaling $25.6 million have been reclassified from other assets and netted against the related debt liabilities to conform with the current year presentation.
1138118_16_ITEM5_P22_S3	See Deferred Financing Costs discussion within Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_16_ITEM5_P22_S4	Amounts for 2011, 2012 and 2013 have not been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	We are the world s largest commercial real estate services and investment firm, based on 2015 revenue, with leading full-service operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P0_S1	We offer a full range of services to occupiers, owners, lenders and investors in office, retail, industrial, multifamily and other types of commercial real estate.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P0_S2	As of December 31, 2015, excluding independent affiliates, we operated in more than 400 offices worldwide with more than 70,000 employees providing commercial real estate services under the CBRE brand name, investment management services under the CBRE Global Investors brand name and development services under the Trammell Crow Company brand name.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P0_S3	Our business is focused on several competencies, including commercial property, corporate facilities, project and transaction management, tenant/occupier and property/agency leasing, capital markets solutions (property sales, commercial mortgage origination, sales and servicing, and structured finance) real estate investment management, valuation, development services and proprietary research.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P0_S4	We generate revenue from both management fees (large multi-year portfolio and per-project contracts) and from commissions on transactions.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P0_S5	We have been included in the Fortune 500 since 2008 and among the Fortune Most Admired Companies in the real estate sector for four consecutive years.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P0_S6	In 2015, we were ranked second among all companies on the Barron s 500, which evaluates companies on growth and financial performance.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P0_S7	Additionally, the International Association of Outsourcing Professionals (IAOP) has ranked us among the top few outsourcing service providers across all industries for five consecutive years.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that management believes to be reasonable.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P1_S2	Actual results may differ from those estimates.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P1_S3	We believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P1_S4	In order for us to recognize revenue, four basic criteria must be met:
1138118_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our revenue recognition policies are consistent with these criteria.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	The judgments involved in revenue recognition include understanding the complex terms of agreements and determining the appropriate time to recognize revenue for each transaction based on such terms.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	Each transaction is evaluated to determine: (i) at what point in time revenue is earned; (ii) whether contingencies exist that impact the timing of recognition of revenue; and (iii) how and when such contingencies will be resolved.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P3_S2	The timing of revenue recognition could vary if different judgments were made.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P3_S3	Our revenues subject to the most judgment are brokerage commission revenue and incentive-based management and development fees.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P3_S4	For a detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policies, see the Revenue Recognition section within Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this Annual Report).
1138118_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	In establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables, we make assumptions with respect to future collectability.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	Our assumptions are based on an assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends, including the aging of receivables balances.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are more than 180 days overdue are evaluated for collectability and fully provided for if deemed uncollectible.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	Historically, our credit losses have generally been insignificant.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	However, estimating losses requires significant judgment, and conditions may change or new information may become known after any periodic evaluation.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P6_S2	As a result, actual credit losses may differ from our estimates.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting, which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	In determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, we use a variety of valuation methods including present value, depreciated replacement cost, market values (where available) and selling prices less costs to dispose.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	We are responsible for determining the valuation of assets and liabilities and for the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	Assumptions must often be made in determining fair values, particularly where observable market values do not exist.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	Assumptions may include discount rates, growth rates, cost of capital, royalty rates, tax rates and remaining useful lives.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P10_S2	These assumptions can have a significant impact on the value of identifiable assets and accordingly can impact the value of goodwill recorded.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P10_S3	Different assumptions could result in different values being attributed to assets and liabilities.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P10_S4	Since these values impact the amount of annual depreciation and amortization expense, different assumptions could also impact our statement of operations and could impact the results of future asset impairment reviews.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	We are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	The goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step process.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	The first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	We use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P13_S3	These assumptions include revenue growth rates, profit margin percentages, discount rates, etc.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered to not be impaired.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	The second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one, over the estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P15_S2	Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business s fair value and the relative size of our goodwill, if different assumptions and estimates were used, it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a non-amortizable intangible asset impairment of $98.1 million in our Global Investment Management segment.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P16_S1	This non-cash write-off was related to a decrease in value of our open-end funds, primarily in Europe.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P16_S2	For additional information on goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing, see Notes 2, 5 and 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with the Accounting for Income Taxes , Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, (Topic 740).
1138118_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P18_S2	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (ASU 2015-17).
1138118_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	This ASU requires the offset of all deferred tax assets and liabilities, including valuation allowances, for each tax-paying jurisdiction within each tax-paying component.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	The net deferred tax must be presented as a single noncurrent amount.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	Entities may elect to use either a prospective or retrospective transition method.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P23_S1	We elected to early adopt the provisions of ASU 2015-17 during the fourth quarter of 2015 and balance sheet amounts as of December 31, 2014 have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	As of December 31, 2014, $205.9 million of current deferred tax assets were reclassified to long term deferred tax assets.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	Accounting for tax positions requires judgments, including estimating reserves for potential uncertainties.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P25_S1	We also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P25_S2	We do not record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that we believe will be realized in future periods.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P25_S3	While we believe the resulting tax balances as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with Topic 740, as applicable, the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P25_S4	Our foreign subsidiaries have accumulated $1.4 billion of undistributed earnings for which we have not recorded a deferred tax liability.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P25_S5	Although tax liabilities might result from dividends being paid out of these earnings, or as a result of a sale or liquidation of non-U.S. subsidiaries, these earnings are permanently reinvested outside of the United States and we do not have any plans to repatriate them or to sell or liquidate any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P25_S6	To the extent that we are able to repatriate earnings in a tax efficient manner, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds, net of foreign tax credits.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P25_S7	Determining our tax liability upon repatriation is not practicable.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P25_S8	Cash and cash equivalents owned by non-U.S. subsidiaries totaled $315.5 million at December 31, 2015.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P25_S9	In 2013, we repatriated $196.2 million.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P25_S10	Tax benefits associated with the release of valuation allowances on foreign tax credits of $14.5 million and $4.9 million were recorded in 2013 and 2014, respectively.

1138118_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	Items Affecting Comparability Macroeconomic Conditions Economic trends and government policies affect global and regional commercial real estate markets as well as our operations directly.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	These include: overall economic activity and employment growth; interest rate levels and changes in interest rates; the cost and availability of credit; and the impact of tax and regulatory policies.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	employment levels, decreasing demand for commercial real estate, falling real estate values, disruption to the global capital or credit markets, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, will negatively affect the performance of our business.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	Compensation is our largest expense and the sales and leasing professionals in our advisory services business generally are paid on a commission and/or bonus basis that correlates with their revenue production.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P27_S2	As a result, the negative effect of difficult market conditions on our operating margins is partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P27_S3	In addition, when negative economic conditions have been particularly severe, we have moved decisively to lower operating expenses to improve financial performance, and then have restored certain expenses as economic conditions improved.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P27_S4	Nevertheless, adverse global and regional economic trends could pose significant risks to the performance of our operations and our financial condition.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	Commercial real estate markets have recovered over the past several years, along with the steady improvement in global economic activity, most particularly in the United States.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P28_S1	Since 2010, increased U.S. property sales activity has been sustained by gradually improving market fundamentals, low-cost credit availability and increased global and domestic capital flows.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P28_S2	During this time, U.S. leasing markets have been marked by increased demand for space, falling vacancies and higher rents.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	European economies began to emerge from recession in 2013, with most countries returning to positive, albeit modest, economic growth.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	Reflecting the macro environment, leasing markets in most of Europe were slow to recover, but improved significantly in 2015.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P29_S2	Buoyed by low-cost credit and continued capital flows, Europe saw increased property sales activity in 2015, with higher volumes occurring across more markets, particularly on the continent.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	In Asia Pacific, the performance of real estate leasing and investment markets has varied from country to country amid slowing economic growth.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P30_S1	Strength in Australia has generally compensated for slower activity elsewhere in the region.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P30_S2	In addition, increasingly, local capital has been migrating to other parts of the world.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P30_S3	Real estate investment management and property development markets have been generally favorable with abundant debt and equity capital flows into commercial real estate.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P30_S4	However, real estate equity securities markets were adversely affected in 2015 by investor concerns about rising interest rates.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	The performance of our global sales, leasing, investment management and development services operations depends on sustained economic growth and strong job creation; stable, healthy global credit markets; and continued positive business and investor sentiment.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	Effects of Acquisitions The Company historically has made significant use of strategic acquisitions to add new service competencies, to increase our scale within existing competencies and to expand our presence in various geographic regions around the world.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	On September 1, 2015, CBRE, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, closed on a Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with Johnson Controls, Inc. (JCI) to acquire JCI s Global Workplace Solutions (GWS) business (which we refer to as the GWS Acquisition).
1138118_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	The acquired GWS business is a market-leading provider of integrated facilities management solutions for major occupiers of commercial real estate and has significant operations around the world.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P32_S2	The purchase price was $1.475 billion, paid in cash, with adjustments for working capital and other items.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P32_S3	We completed the GWS Acquisition in order to advance our strategy of delivering globally integrated services to major occupiers in our Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific segments.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P32_S4	We merged the acquired GWS business with our existing occupier outsourcing business line, and the new combined business adopted the Global Workplace Solutions name.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P32_S5	Strategic in-fill acquisitions have also played a key role in expanding our geographic coverage and broadening and strengthening our service offerings.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	specialty firms that complement our existing platform within a region, or independent affiliates in which, in some cases, we held a small equity interest.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	During 2015, we completed eight in-fill acquisitions, including a Seattle-based leader in capital markets services for affordable housing, a Texas-based commercial real estate firm specializing in retail services, an energy management specialist based in Brookfield, Wisconsin, a Chicago-based location data analytics firm, one of the leading retail real estate services firms in the midwestern United States, an advisory, consulting and research firm specializing in the Canadian hospitality and tourism industries and our former independent affiliate companies in Columbia, South Carolina, and Memphis, Tennessee.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P33_S2	During 2014, we completed 11 in-fill acquisitions, including our former independent affiliate companies in Thailand, Greenville, South Carolina, Louisville, Kentucky and Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Oklahoma, a commercial real estate service provider in Chicago, a New York-based valuation and advisory business, a technical real estate consulting firm based in Germany, a consulting and advisory firm in the U.S. hotels sector, a shopping center management, leasing and consulting company in Switzerland and project management companies in Germany and Australia.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	Although we believe that strategic acquisitions can significantly decrease the cost, time and commitment of management resources necessary to attain a meaningful competitive position within targeted markets or to expand our presence within our current markets, in general, most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating and net income.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P34_S1	The adverse impact is a result of transaction-related expenditures, which include severance, lease termination, transaction and deferred financing costs, among others, and the charges and costs of integrating the acquired business and its financial and accounting systems into our own.
1138118_16_ITEM7_P34_S2	In addition, our acquisition structures often include deferred and/or contingent purchase price payments in future periods that are subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES All other schedules are omitted because they are either not applicable, not required or the information required is included in the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes thereto.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P1_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders CBRE Group, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CBRE Group, Inc. (the Company) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P1_S1	In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the related financial statement schedule.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P1_S2	We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1138118_16_ITEM8_P1_S3	The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting .
1138118_16_ITEM8_P1_S4	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P1_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1138118_16_ITEM8_P1_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P1_S7	Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P1_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P1_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P1_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P2_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P2_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P2_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P2_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P3_S0	CBRE Group, Inc. acquired the Global Workplace Solutions business during 2015 (the Acquired Business) as defined in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, the Acquired Business s internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets of $2.3 billion and total revenues of $982.0 million included in the consolidated financial statements of CBRE Group, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P3_S1	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the Acquired Business.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P4_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of CBRE Group, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P4_S1	Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P4_S2	Also in our opinion, CBRE Group, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P5_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P6_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P7_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P8_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P9_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P10_S0	Nature of Operations CBRE Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (which may be referred to in these financial statements as the Company , we , us and our ), was incorporated on February 20, 2001.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P10_S1	We are the world s largest commercial real estate services and investment firm, based on 2015 revenue, with leading full-service operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P10_S2	We offer a full range of services to occupiers, owners, lenders and investors in office, retail, industrial, multifamily and other types of commercial real estate.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P10_S3	Excluding independent affiliates, we operate in more than 400 offices worldwide, with more than 70,000 employees providing commercial real estate services under the CBRE brand name, investment management services under the CBRE Global Investors brand name and development services under the Trammell Crow Company brand name.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P10_S4	Our business is focused on several competencies, including commercial property, corporate facilities, project and transaction management, tenant/occupier and property/agency leasing, capital markets solutions (property sales, commercial mortgage origination, sales and servicing, and structured finance), real estate investment management, valuation, development services and proprietary research.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P10_S5	We generate revenue from both management fees (large multi-year portfolio and per-project contracts) and from commissions on transactions.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P10_S6	Our contractual, fee-for-services businesses generally involve property and facilities management, mortgage loan servicing, investment management and appraisal/valuation.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P10_S7	In addition, our leasing services have contractual elements and work for clients in this service line is often recurring in nature.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P11_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our consolidated subsidiaries, which are comprised of variable interest entities (VIEs) in which we are the primary beneficiary and voting interest entities (VOEs), in which we determined we have a controlling financial interest, under the Consolidations Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) (Topic 810).
1138118_16_ITEM8_P11_S1	The equity attributable to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries is shown separately in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P11_S2	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P12_S0	Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) We consolidate all VIEs in which we are the entity s primary beneficiary.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P12_S1	A reporting entity is determined to be the primary beneficiary if it holds a controlling financial interest in the VIE.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P12_S2	(2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from such entity that could potentially be significant to such entity.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P12_S3	The entity which satisfies these criteria is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P12_S4	The consolidation guidance requires an analysis to determine (a) whether an entity in which we hold a variable interest is a VIE and (b) whether our involvement, through holding interests directly or indirectly in the entity or contractually through other variable interests (for example, management and performance related fees), would give us a controlling financial interest.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P12_S5	Performance of that analysis requires the exercise of judgment.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P13_S0	We determine if an entity is a VIE based on several factors, including whether the entity s total equity investment at risk upon inception is sufficient to finance the entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P13_S1	We make judgments regarding the sufficiency of the equity at risk based first on a qualitative analysis, then a quantitative analysis, if necessary.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P14_S0	We analyze any investments in VIEs to determine if we are the primary beneficiary.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P14_S1	We determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE at the time we become involved with a variable interest entity and reconsider that conclusion continually.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P15_S0	In evaluating whether we are the primary beneficiary, we evaluate our direct and indirect economic interests in the entity.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P15_S1	We consider a variety of factors in identifying the entity that holds the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance including, but not limited to, the ability to direct financing, leasing, construction and other operating decisions and activities.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P15_S2	In addition, we consider the rights of other investors to participate in those decisions, to replace the manager and to sell or liquidate the entity.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P15_S3	We consolidate any VIE of which we are the primary beneficiary and disclose significant VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary, if any, as well as disclose our maximum exposure to loss related to VIEs that are not consolidated (see Note 4).
1138118_16_ITEM8_P16_S0	We determine whether an entity is a VIE and, if so, whether it should be consolidated by utilizing judgments and estimates that are inherently subjective.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P17_S0	Voting Interest Entities (VOEs) For VOEs, we consolidate the entity if we have a controlling financial interest.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P17_S1	We have a controlling financial interest in a VOE if (i) for legal entities other than limited partnerships, we own a majority voting interest in the VOE or, for limited partnerships and similar entities, we own a majority of the entity s kick-out rights through voting limited partnership interests and (ii) non-controlling shareholders or partners do not hold substantive participating rights and no other conditions exist that would indicate that we do not control the entity.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P17_S2	Other Investments Our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, but do not control, or entities which are variable interest entities in which we are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for under the equity method.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P17_S3	We eliminate transactions with such equity method subsidiaries to the extent of our ownership in such subsidiaries.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P17_S4	Accordingly, our share of the earnings from these equity-method basis companies is included in consolidated net income.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P17_S5	All other investments held on a long-term basis are valued at cost less any impairment in value.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P17_S6	Under either the equity or cost method, impairment losses are recognized upon evidence of other-than-temporary losses of value.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P18_S0	When testing for impairment on investments that are not actively traded on a public market, we generally use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our investments and/or look to comparable activities in the marketplace.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P18_S1	Management s judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow approach.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P18_S2	These assumptions include net asset values, internal rates of return, discount and capitalization rates, interest rates and financing terms, rental rates, timing of leasing activity, estimates of lease terms and related concessions, etc.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P18_S3	When determining if impairment is other-than-temporary, we also look to the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been less than cost as well as the financial condition and near-term prospects of each investment.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P19_S0	Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.), or GAAP, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P19_S1	These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses we report.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P19_S2	Such estimates include the value of goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets, accounts receivable, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, retirement and other post-employment benefits, among others.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P19_S3	These estimates and assumptions are based on management s best judgment, and are evaluated on an ongoing basis and adjusted, as needed, using historical experience and other factors, including consideration of the macroeconomic environment.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P19_S4	As future events and their effects cannot be forecast with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P19_S5	Changes in estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P20_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents generally consist of cash and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P20_S1	Included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 is cash and cash equivalents of $70.2 million and $58.0 million, respectively, from consolidated funds and other entities, which are not available for general corporate use.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P20_S2	We also manage certain cash and cash equivalents as an agent for our investment and property and facilities management clients.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P20_S3	These amounts are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets (see Note 16).
1138118_16_ITEM8_P21_S0	Restricted Cash Included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 is restricted cash of $72.8 million and $28.1 million, respectively.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P21_S1	The balances primarily include restricted cash set aside to cover funding obligations as required by contracts executed by us in the ordinary course of business.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P22_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist principally of trade receivables and interest-bearing investments.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P22_S1	Users of real estate services account for a substantial portion of trade receivables and collateral is generally not required.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P22_S2	The risk associated with this concentration is limited due to the large number of users and their geographic dispersion.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P23_S0	We place substantially all of our interest-bearing investments with several major financial institutions to limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P24_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P24_S1	Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment is computed primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging up to 15 years.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P25_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the term of their associated leases, excluding options to renew, since such leases generally do not carry prohibitive penalties for non-renewal.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P26_S0	We capitalize expenditures that significantly increase the life of our assets and expense the costs of maintenance and repairs.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P26_S1	We review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P26_S2	If this review indicates that such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment is recognized in the period the changes occur and represents the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P27_S0	Certain costs related to the development or purchase of internal-use software are capitalized.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P27_S1	Internal-use software costs that are incurred in the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P27_S2	Direct consulting costs as well as payroll and related costs, which are incurred during the development stage of a project are generally capitalized and amortized over a three-year period (except for enterprise software development platforms, which range from five to ten years) when placed into production.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P28_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting, which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P28_S1	The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P28_S2	The majority of our goodwill balance has resulted from our acquisition of CBRE Services, Inc. (CBRE) in 2001 (the 2001 Acquisition), our acquisition of Insignia Financial Group, Inc. (Insignia) in 2003 (the Insignia Acquisition), our acquisition of the Trammell Crow Company in 2006 (the Trammell Crow Company Acquisition), our acquisition of substantially all of the ING Group N.V. (ING) Real Estate Investment Management (REIM) operations in Europe and Asia, as well as substantially all of Clarion Real Estate Securities (CRES) in 2011 (collectively referred to as the REIM Acquisitions), our acquisition of Norland Managed Services Ltd (Norland) in 2013 (the Norland Acquisition) and our acquisition of Johnson Controls, Inc. (JCI) s Global Workplace Solutions (GWS) business.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P28_S3	Other intangible assets that have indefinite estimated useful lives that are not being amortized include certain management contracts identified in the REIM Acquisitions, a trademark, which was separately identified as a result of the 2001 Acquisition, as well as a trade name separately identified as a result of the REIM Acquisitions.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P28_S4	The remaining other intangible assets primarily include customer relationships, mortgage servicing rights, trademarks, management contracts and a covenant not to compete, which are all being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging up to 20 years.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P28_S5	We are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually, or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P29_S0	The goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step process.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P30_S0	The first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P30_S1	We use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P30_S2	Management s judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P30_S3	These assumptions include revenue growth rates, profit margin percentages, discount rates, etc.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P31_S0	If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P31_S1	If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P32_S0	The second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P32_S1	The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one, over the estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P32_S2	Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business s fair value and the relative size of our goodwill, if different assumptions and estimates were used, it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P33_S0	Deferred Financing Costs Costs incurred in connection with financing activities are generally deferred and amortized over the terms of the related debt agreements ranging up to ten years.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P33_S1	Amortization of these costs is charged to interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P34_S0	Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P35_S0	ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts, and requires the use of the retrospective method.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P35_S1	ASU 2015-15 permits classifying debt issuance costs associated with a line of credit arrangement as an asset, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the arrangement.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P35_S2	ASU 2015-03 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P35_S3	ASU 2015-15 is effective upon the adoption of ASU 2015-03.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P35_S4	We elected to early adopt the provisions of ASU 2015-03 during the third quarter of 2015 and balance sheet amounts as of December 31, 2014 have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P36_S0	As of December 31, 2014, $25.6 million of debt issuance costs were reclassified from other assets and netted against the related debt liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as follows (dollars in thousands): The adoption of ASU 2015-03 had no impact on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P36_S1	Total deferred financing costs, net of accumulated amortization, related to our revolving line of credit have been included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and were $22.1 million and $9.4 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P36_S2	During 2015, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement providing for a $500.0 million tranche A term loan facility and a $2.6 billion revolving credit facility.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P36_S3	In addition, we added new tranche B-1 and tranche B-2 term loan facilities under this same credit facility pursuant to which we borrowed an additional $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P36_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2015, in connection with these financing activities, we incurred approximately $21.7 million of financing costs, of which $1.0 million was expensed.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P36_S5	In addition, we expensed $1.7 million of previously-deferred financing costs.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P36_S6	All of these write-offs were included in write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P36_S7	During 2014, we completed three financing transactions, which included the issuance in September and December of $300.0 million and $125.0 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due March 15, 2025 and the redemption in October 2014 of all of the then outstanding 6.625% senior notes (aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million).
1138118_16_ITEM8_P36_S8	During the year ended December 31, 2014, in connection with these financing activities, we incurred approximately $4.7 million of financing costs.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P36_S9	In addition, we expensed $5.7 million of previously-deferred financing costs as well as a $17.4 million early extinguishment premium, all of which were included in the write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P36_S10	During 2013, we completed a series of financing transactions, including the amendment and restatement of a prior credit agreement, the issuance of $800.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior notes due March 15, 2023 and the redemption of all of the 11.625% senior subordinated notes totaling $450.0 million.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P36_S11	During the year ended December 31, 2013, in connection with all of these financing activities, we incurred approximately $28.6 million of financing costs, of which $3.6 million was expensed.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P37_S0	$17.8 million of previously-deferred financing costs as well as a $26.2 million early extinguishment premium and $8.7 million of unamortized original issue discount associated with the 11.625% senior subordinated notes.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P37_S1	All of these write-offs were included in write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P37_S2	See Note 10 for additional information on activities associated with our debt.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P38_S0	We record commission revenue on real estate sales generally upon close of escrow or transfer of title, except when future contingencies exist.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P38_S1	Real estate commissions on leases are generally recorded in revenue when all obligations under the commission agreement are satisfied.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P39_S0	Terms and conditions of a commission agreement may include, but are not limited to, execution of a signed lease agreement and future contingencies including tenant occupancy, payment of a deposit or payment of a first month s rent (or a combination thereof).
1138118_16_ITEM8_P40_S0	A typical commission agreement provides that we earn a portion of a lease commission upon the execution of the lease agreement by the tenant and landlord, with the remaining portion(s) of the lease commission earned at a later date, usually upon tenant occupancy or payment of rent.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P40_S1	The existence of any significant future contingencies results in the delay of recognition of corresponding revenue until such contingencies are satisfied.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P40_S2	For example, if we do not earn all or a portion of the lease commission until the tenant pays its first month s rent, and the lease agreement provides the tenant with a free rent period, we delay revenue recognition until rent is paid by the tenant.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P40_S3	As some of these conditions are outside of our control and are often not clearly defined, judgment must be exercised in determining when such required events have occurred in order to recognize revenue.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P41_S0	Property and facilities management revenues are generally based upon percentages of the revenue or base rent generated by the entities managed or the square footage managed.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P41_S1	These fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related management agreements.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P42_S0	Our clients reimburse us for certain expenses incurred on their behalf, primarily in our property and facilities management operations.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P42_S1	Our treatment of these reimbursements is based upon the terms of the underlying contract.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P42_S2	We use certain indicators as to whether we record the reimbursements on a gross versus net basis, such as whether we are the primary obligor on the contracts, whether the contract is based on a fixed fee, credit risk and our discretion in making vendor selections and establishing prices.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P42_S3	In certain instances, we have determined we are acting as the principal in the transaction and, accordingly, report these reimbursements as revenue on a gross basis with the total costs reflected in cost of services.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P42_S4	Reimbursement revenue is recognized when the underlying reimbursable costs are incurred.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P42_S5	When we determine we are not the primary obligor and are acting as an agent, we account for the transaction on a net basis.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P43_S0	Investment management fees are based predominantly upon a percentage of the equity deployed on behalf of our limited partners.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P43_S1	Fees related to our indirect investment management programs are based upon a percentage of the fair value of those investments.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P43_S2	These fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related investment management agreements.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P44_S0	Our Global Investment Management segment earns performance-based incentive fees with regard to many of its investments.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P44_S1	Such revenue is recognized at the end of the measurement periods when the conditions of the applicable incentive fee arrangements have been satisfied and following the expiration of any potential claw back provision.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P44_S2	With many of these investments, our Global Investment Management professionals have participation interests in such incentive fees, which are commonly referred to as carried interest.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P44_S3	This carried interest expense is generally accrued for based upon the probability of such performance-based incentive fees being earned over the related vesting period.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P45_S0	properties on behalf of certain funds and separate accounts.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P45_S1	Such revenue is recognized at the completion of a successful transaction and is not subject to any claw back provision.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P46_S0	Appraisal fees are recorded after services have been rendered.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P46_S1	and we have no significant remaining obligations for performance in connection with the transaction, while loan servicing fees are recorded in revenue as monthly principal and interest payments are collected from mortgagors.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P46_S2	Other commissions, consulting fees and referral fees are recorded as revenue at the time the related services have been performed, unless significant future contingencies exist.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P47_S0	Development services and project management services generate fees from development and construction management projects.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P47_S1	Most development and construction management and project management assignments are subject to agreements that describe the calculation of fees and when we earn such fees.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P47_S2	The earnings terms of these agreements dictate when we recognize the related revenue.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P47_S3	Generally, development fees are recognized based on the lower of the amount billed or the amount determined on a straight-line basis over the development period.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P48_S0	We may earn incentive fees for project management services based upon achievement of certain performance criteria as set forth in the project management services agreement.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P48_S1	Incentive development fees are recognized when quantitative criteria have been met (such as specified leasing, budget or time-based targets) or for those incentive fees based on qualitative criteria, upon approval of the fee by our clients.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P48_S2	Certain incentive development fees allow us to share in the fair value of the developed real estate asset above cost.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P48_S3	This sharing creates additional revenue potential to us with no exposure to loss other than opportunity cost.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P48_S4	We recognize such fees when the specified target is attained and fees are deemed collectible.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P49_S0	We record deferred income to the extent that cash payments have been received in accordance with the terms of underlying agreements, but such amounts have not yet met the criteria for revenue recognition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P49_S1	We recognize such revenues when the appropriate criteria are met.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P50_S0	In establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables, we make assumptions with respect to future collectability.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P50_S1	Our assumptions are based on an assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends, including the aging of receivables balances.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P50_S2	In addition to these assessments, in general, outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are more than 180 days overdue are evaluated for collectability and fully provided for if deemed uncollectible.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P51_S0	Historically, our credit losses have generally been insignificant.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P51_S1	However, estimating losses requires significant judgment, and conditions may change or new information may become known after any periodic evaluation.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P51_S2	As a result, actual credit losses may differ from our estimates.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P52_S0	The costs of business promotion and advertising are expensed as incurred.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P52_S1	Business promotion and advertising costs of $62.7 million, $55.6 million and $49.4 million were included in operating, administrative and other expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P53_S0	The financial statements of subsidiaries located outside the U.S. are generally measured using the local currency as the functional currency.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P53_S1	The assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date, and income and expenses are translated at the average monthly rate.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P53_S2	The resulting translation adjustments are included in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of equity.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P54_S0	Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the results of operations.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P55_S0	As required by FASB ASC Topic 815 Derivatives and Hedging , we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P55_S1	We do not net derivatives on our balance sheet.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P55_S2	The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P56_S0	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P56_S1	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P56_S2	Derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P57_S0	Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P58_S0	We may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of our risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or we elect not to apply hedge accounting.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P58_S1	In all cases, we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and, accordingly, do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P59_S0	Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive (loss) income.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P59_S1	In the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, accumulated other comprehensive loss consists of foreign currency translation adjustments, fees associated with the termination of interest rate swaps, unrealized (losses) gains on interest rate swaps and interest rate caps, unrealized holding (losses) gains on available for sale securities and pension liability adjustments.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P59_S2	Foreign currency translation adjustments exclude any income tax effect given that earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries are deemed to be reinvested for an indefinite period of time (see Note 13).
1138118_16_ITEM8_P60_S0	Marketable Securities We account for investments in marketable debt and equity securities in accordance with the Investments Debt and Equity Securities Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 320).
1138118_16_ITEM8_P60_S1	We determine the appropriate classification of debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P61_S0	Marketable securities we acquire with the intent to generate a profit from short-term movements in market prices are classified as trading securities.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P61_S1	Debt securities are classified as held to maturity when we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P61_S2	Marketable equity and debt securities not classified as trading or held to maturity are classified as available for sale.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P62_S0	Trading securities are carried at their fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in net income.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P62_S1	Available for sale securities are carried at their fair value and any difference between cost and fair value is recorded as unrealized gain or loss, net of income taxes, and is reported as accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated statement of equity.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P63_S0	Premiums and discounts are recognized in interest using the effective interest method.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P64_S0	available for sale securities have not been significant.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P64_S1	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P64_S2	Interest and dividends on securities classified as available for sale are included in interest income.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P65_S0	For investments classified as available for sale, we assess impairment at the individual security level.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P65_S1	An investment is impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost basis.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P65_S2	When an impairment exists, we assess whether such impairment is temporary or other than temporary.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P65_S3	We review the volatility and intended holding period of our investments and also determine if we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that the value would be recovered over the intended holding period.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P65_S4	Based on our review, we did not record any other than temporary impairment losses during the years ending December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P66_S0	Our wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE Capital Markets, Inc. (CBRE Capital Markets) is a Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) approved Multifamily Program Plus Seller/Servicer and an approved Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) Aggregation and Negotiated Transaction Seller/Servicer.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P66_S1	In addition, CBRE Capital Markets wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE Multifamily Capital, Inc. (CBRE MCI) is an approved Fannie Mae Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS) Seller/Servicer and CBRE Capital Markets wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE HMF is a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) approved Non-Supervised Federal Housing Authority (FHA) Title II Mortgagee, an approved Multifamily Accelerated Processing (MAP) lender and an approved Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) issuer of mortgage-backed securities (MBS).
1138118_16_ITEM8_P67_S0	Under these arrangements, before loans are originated through proceeds from warehouse lines of credit, we obtain either a contractual loan purchase commitment from either Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae or a confirmed forward trade commitment for the issuance and purchase of a Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae MBS that will be secured by the loans.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P67_S1	The warehouse lines of credit are generally repaid within a one-month period when Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae buys the loans or upon settlement of the Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae MBS, while we retain the servicing rights.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P68_S0	Loans are funded at the prevailing market rates.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P69_S0	We elect the fair value option for all warehouse receivables.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P69_S1	At December 31, 2015 and 2014, all of the warehouse receivables included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were either under commitment to be purchased by Freddie Mac or had confirmed forward trade commitments for the issuance and purchase of Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae mortgage backed securities that will be secured by the underlying loans.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P70_S0	In connection with the origination and sale of mortgage loans with servicing rights retained, we record servicing assets or liabilities based on the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights on the date the loans are sold.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P70_S1	We also assume or purchase certain servicing assets.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P71_S0	Our mortgage service rights (MSRs) are initially recorded at fair value.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P71_S1	Subsequent to the initial recording, MSRs are amortized and carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value in other intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P71_S2	They are amortized in proportion to and over the estimated period that net servicing income is expected to be received based on projections and timing of estimated future net cash flows.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P72_S0	Our initial recording of MSRs at their fair value resulted in net gains, as the fair value of servicing contracts that result in MSR assets exceeded the fair value of servicing contracts that result in MSR liabilities.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P72_S1	The net assets and net gains are presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P73_S0	The amount of MSRs recognized during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was as follows (dollars in thousands): Mortgage servicing rights do not actively trade in an open market with readily available observable prices; therefore, fair value is determined based on certain assumptions and judgments, including the estimation of the present value of future cash flows realized from servicing the underlying mortgage loans.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P73_S1	Management s assumptions include the benefits of servicing (servicing fee income and interest on escrow deposits), inflation, the cost of servicing, prepayment rates, delinquencies, discount rates and the estimated life of servicing cash flows.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P73_S2	The assumptions used are subject to change based on management s judgments and estimates of changes in future cash flows and interest rates, among other things.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P73_S3	The key assumptions used during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 in measuring fair value were as follows:
1138118_16_ITEM8_P73_S4	The estimated fair value of our mortgage servicing rights was $301.2 million and $245.1 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P73_S5	Impairment is evaluated through a comparison of the carrying amount and fair value of the MSRs, and recognized with the establishment of a valuation allowance.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P73_S6	We did not incur any impairment charges related to our MRSs during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 or 2013.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P73_S7	No valuation allowance was created previously and we did not record a valuation allowance for MSRs in 2015 or 2014.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P73_S8	Included in revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations are contractually specified servicing fees from loans serviced for others of $78.9 million, $65.2 million and $55.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and pre-payment fees/late fees/ancillary income earned from loans serviced for others of $8.4 million, $6.1 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P74_S0	Accounting for Broker Draws As part of our recruitment efforts relative to new U.S. brokers, we offer a transitional broker draw arrangement.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P74_S1	Our broker draw arrangements generally last until such time as a broker s pipeline of business is sufficient to allow him or her to earn sustainable commissions.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P75_S0	This program is intended to provide the broker with a minimal amount of cash flow to allow adequate time for his or her training as well as time for him or her to develop business relationships.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P75_S1	Similar to traditional salaries, the broker draws are paid irrespective of the actual revenues generated by the broker.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P76_S0	Furthermore, it is not our general policy to pursue collection of unearned broker draws paid under this arrangement.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P76_S1	As a result, we have concluded that broker draws are economically equivalent to salaries paid and accordingly charge them to compensation as incurred.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P77_S0	The broker is also entitled to earn a commission on completed revenue transactions.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P77_S1	This amount is calculated as the commission that would have been payable under our full commission program, less any amounts previously paid to the broker in the form of a draw.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P78_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We account for all employee awards under the fair value recognition provisions of the Compensation Stock Compensation Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 718).
1138118_16_ITEM8_P78_S1	Topic 718 requires the measurement of compensation cost at the grant date, based upon the estimated fair value of the award, and requires amortization of the related expense over the employee s requisite service period.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P78_S2	See Note 12 for additional information on our stock-based compensation plans.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P79_S0	Basic income per share attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. is computed by dividing net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P79_S1	The computation of diluted income per share attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. generally further assumes the dilutive effect of potential common shares, which include stock options and certain contingently issuable shares.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P79_S2	Contingently issuable shares consist of non-vested stock awards.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P80_S0	Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with the Accounting for Income Taxes Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 740).
1138118_16_ITEM8_P81_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P81_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P81_S2	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P82_S0	Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P83_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (ASU 2015-17).
1138118_16_ITEM8_P83_S1	This ASU requires the offset of all deferred tax assets and liabilities, including valuation allowances, for each tax-paying jurisdiction within each tax-paying component.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P84_S0	The net deferred tax must be presented as a single noncurrent amount.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P85_S0	ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P86_S0	Entities may elect to use either a prospective or retrospective transition method.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P86_S1	We elected to early adopt the provisions of ASU 2015-17 during the fourth quarter of 2015 and balance sheet amounts as of December 31, 2014 have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P87_S0	As of December 31, 2014, $205.9 million of current deferred tax assets were reclassified to long term deferred tax assets.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P88_S0	Self-Insurance Our wholly-owned captive insurance company, which is subject to applicable insurance rules and regulations, insures our exposure related to workers compensation insurance provided to employees and we purchase excess coverage from an unrelated insurance carrier.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P89_S0	insurance through an unrelated insurance carrier.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P89_S1	The captive insurance company reinsures the related deductibles.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P89_S2	The captive insurance company also insures deductibles relating to professional indemnity claims.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P89_S3	Given the nature of these types of claims, it may take several years for resolution and determination of the cost of these claims.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P89_S4	We are required to estimate the cost of these claims in our financial statements.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P89_S5	The estimates that we utilize to record our potential losses on claims are inherently subjective, and actual claims could differ from amounts recorded, which could result in increased or decreased expense in future periods.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P89_S6	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, our reserves for claims under these insurance programs were $73.8 million and $73.2 million, respectively, of which $1.9 million and $2.0 million, respectively, represented our estimated current liabilities as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P90_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).
1138118_16_ITEM8_P90_S1	This ASU requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P90_S2	ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP when it becomes effective on January 1, 2018.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P90_S3	This ASU permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P91_S0	We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P91_S1	We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of this ASU on our ongoing financial reporting.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P92_S0	In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P92_S1	This ASU provides consolidation guidance for legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations and securitization structures.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P92_S2	ASU 2015-02 offers updated consolidation evaluation criteria and may require additional disclosures.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P92_S3	This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P92_S4	We do not believe the adoption of ASU 2015-02 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or disclosure requirements of our consolidated financial statements.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P93_S0	(Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P93_S1	This ASU will significantly change the income statement impact of equity investments and the recognition of changes in fair value of financial liabilities when the fair value option is elected.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P93_S2	This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P93_S3	Early adoption is not permitted, except when adopting the provisions related to the recognition of changes in fair value of financial liabilities when the fair value option is elected.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P94_S0	We do not believe the adoption of ASU 2016-01 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or disclosure requirements of our consolidated financial statements.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P94_S1	Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2014 and 2013 financial statements to conform with the 2015 presentation.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P95_S0	On September 1, 2015, CBRE, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, closed on a Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement with JCI to acquire JCI s GWS business (which we refer to as the GWS Acquisition).
1138118_16_ITEM8_P95_S1	The acquired GWS business is a market-leading provider of integrated facilities management solutions for major occupiers of commercial real estate and has significant operations around the world.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P95_S2	The purchase price was $1.475 billion, payable in cash, with adjustments for working capital and other items.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P96_S0	order to advance our strategy of delivering globally integrated services to major occupiers in our Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific segments.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P96_S1	We merged the acquired GWS business with our existing occupier outsourcing business line, and the new combined business adopted the Global Workplace Solutions name.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P96_S2	We financed the transaction with: (i) a new issuance in August 2015 of $600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due March 1, 2026; (ii) borrowings in September 2015 of $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of new tranche B-1 and tranche B-2 term loan facilities under our 2015 Credit Agreement; (iii) borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility under our 2015 Credit Agreement; and (iv) cash on hand.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P96_S3	See Note 10 for more information on the abovementioned debt instruments.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P97_S0	The following represents a summary of the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired (dollars in thousands): The preliminary purchase accounting adjustments related to the GWS Acquisition have been recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P97_S1	The excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired has been recorded to goodwill.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P97_S2	The goodwill arising from the GWS Acquisition consists largely of the synergies and economies of scale expected from combining the operations acquired from GWS with ours.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P97_S3	Of the $786 million of goodwill recorded in connection with the GWS Acquisition, only approximately $396 million is deductible for tax purposes.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P97_S4	The assignment of goodwill to our reporting units has not been completed.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P98_S0	Given the complexity of the transaction, the calculation of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired, including intangible assets and income tax items, is still preliminary.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P98_S1	The purchase price allocation is expected to be completed as soon as practicable, but no later than one year from the acquisition date.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P98_S2	The following table summarizes the aggregate estimated fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in the GWS Acquisition (dollars in thousands):
1138118_16_ITEM8_P99_S0	The following is a summary of the preliminary estimate of the amortizable intangible assets acquired in connection with the GWS Acquisition (dollars in thousands):
1138118_16_ITEM8_P99_S1	The accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes revenue, operating income and net income of $982.0 million, $27.7 million and $18.8 million, respectively, attributable to the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P99_S2	This does not include direct transaction and integration costs of $48.9 million and amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired of $24.2 million, all of which were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015 in connection with the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P99_S3	Unaudited pro forma results, assuming the GWS Acquisition had occurred as of January 1, 2014 for purposes of the 2015 and 2014 pro forma disclosures, are presented below.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P99_S4	They include certain adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2015, including $48.3 million of increased amortization expense as a result of intangible assets acquired in the GWS Acquisition, $22.4 million of additional interest expense as a result of debt incurred to finance the GWS Acquisition, the removal of $48.9 million of direct costs incurred by us related to the GWS Acquisition, and the tax impact for the year ended December 31, 2015 of these pro forma adjustments.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P99_S5	They also include certain adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2014, including $72.5 million of increased amortization expense as a result of intangible assets acquired in the GWS Acquisition, $38.1 million of additional interest expense as a result of debt incurred to finance the GWS Acquisition, and the tax impact for the year ended December 31, 2014 of these pro forma adjustments.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P99_S6	These pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of what operating results would have been had the GWS Acquisition occurred on January 1, 2014 and may not be indicative of future operating results (dollars in thousands, except share data):
1138118_16_ITEM8_P100_S0	We hold variable interests in certain VIEs in our Global Investment Management and Development Services segments which are not consolidated as it was determined that we are not the primary beneficiary.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P100_S1	Our involvement with these entities is in the form of equity co-investments and fee arrangements.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P101_S0	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, our maximum exposure to loss related to the VIEs which are not consolidated was as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_16_ITEM8_P102_S0	The Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 820) defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P102_S1	Topic 820 also establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P102_S2	This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P102_S3	The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:
1138118_16_ITEM8_P103_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P104_S0	Level 2 Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P105_S0	Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P105_S1	This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P105_S2	There were no significant transfers in or out of Level 1 and Level 2 during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P106_S0	The following tables present the fair value of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):
1138118_16_ITEM8_P107_S0	The fair values of the warehouse receivables are calculated based on already locked in security buy prices.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P107_S1	At December 31, 2015 and 2014, all of the warehouse receivables included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were either under commitment to be purchased by Freddie Mac or had confirmed forward trade commitments for the issuance and purchase of Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae mortgage backed securities that will be secured by the underlying loans (See Note 2).
1138118_16_ITEM8_P107_S2	These assets are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as all inputs are readily observable.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P108_S0	The valuation of interest rate swaps and foreign currency exchange forward contracts is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P108_S1	This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate and foreign currency exchange forward curves.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P109_S0	The fair values of interest rate swaps and foreign currency exchange forward contracts are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future estimated cash payments/receipts.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P109_S1	The estimated cash flows are based on an expectation of future interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates using forward curves derived from observable market interest rate and foreign currency exchange forward curves.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P110_S0	The valuation of our loan commitments is determined using discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P110_S1	The primary source of value of each written loan commitment is future servicing rights.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P110_S2	Mortgage servicing rights do not actively trade in an open market with readily available observable prices; therefore, fair value is determined based on certain assumptions and judgments, including the estimation of the present value of future cash flows realized from servicing the underlying mortgage loans (see Note 2).
1138118_16_ITEM8_P110_S3	As such, our loan commitments are classified in Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P110_S4	The following table provides additional information about fair value measurements for these Level 3 assets for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands): Fair value measurements for our available for sale securities are obtained from independent pricing services which utilize observable market data that may include quoted market prices, dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. treasury yield curve, trading levels, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the instrument s terms and conditions.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P111_S0	The trading securities and securities sold, not yet purchased are primarily in the U.S. and are generally valued at the last reported sales price on the day of valuation or, if no sales occurred on the valuation date, at the mean of the bid and asked prices on such date.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P112_S0	There were no significant non-recurring fair value measurements recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P112_S1	The following non-recurring fair value measurements were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):
1138118_16_ITEM8_P113_S0	The fair value measurements employed for our impairment evaluations were generally based on third-party information available in non-active markets (such as third-party appraisals and offers received from third parties) as well as a discounted cash flow approach and/or review of comparable activities in the market place.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P113_S1	Inputs used in these evaluations included risk-free rates of return, estimated risk premiums as well as other economic variables.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P114_S0	Property and Equipment During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded an asset impairment of $8.6 million in our Americas segment.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P114_S1	This non-cash write-off resulted from the decision (due to a change in strategy) to abandon a property database platform that was being developed in the U.S. and was included within operating, administrative and other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P114_S2	Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded write-downs in our Global Investment Management segment of $3.6 million, of which $0.8 million were attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P114_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded write-downs in our Global Investment Management segment of $4.1 million, of which $1.0 million were attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P114_S4	These write-downs were primarily driven by challenging market conditions and a decrease in the estimated holding period of certain assets.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P114_S5	All of our impairment charges related to investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries were included in equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P115_S0	Real Estate During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a provision for loss on real estate held for sale of $1.9 million, of which $1.8 million was attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P115_S1	This charge reduced the carrying value of certain assets to their fair value, less cost to sell, primarily due to reduced selling prices resulting from a decrease in the estimated holding period of certain assets.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P116_S0	All of the abovementioned charges were reported in our Development Services segment.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P116_S1	All of the abovementioned charges were included within operating, administrative and other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P117_S0	Other Intangible Assets During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a non-amortizable intangible asset impairment of $98.1 million in our Global Investment Management segment.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P117_S1	This non-cash write-off related to a decrease in value of our open-end funds, primarily in Europe.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P117_S2	These funds experienced a decline in assets under management, as the business mix shifted toward separate accounts, consistent with market movements following the extended financial crisis in Europe, which resulted in project sales and planned liquidations of certain funds.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P117_S3	All of our impairment charges related to non-amortizable intangible assets were included as a separate line item in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P118_S0	FASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P118_S1	Our financial instruments are as follows: Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash : These balances include cash and cash equivalents as well as restricted cash with maturities of less than three months.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P118_S2	The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P119_S0	Receivables, less Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: Due to their short-term nature, fair value approximates carrying value.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P119_S1	Warehouse Receivables: These balances are carried at fair value based on market prices at the balance sheet date.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P119_S2	Trading and Available for Sale Securities: These investments are carried at their fair value.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P119_S3	Foreign Currency Exchange Forward Contracts and Loan Commitments: These assets and liabilities are carried at their fair value as calculated by using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative (see Note 6).
1138118_16_ITEM8_P119_S4	Securities Sold, not yet Purchased: These liabilities are carried at their fair value.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P119_S5	Short-Term Borrowings : The majority of this balance represents outstanding amounts under our warehouse lines of credit for CBRE Capital Markets and our revolving credit facility.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P119_S6	Due to the short-term nature and variable interest rates of these instruments, fair value approximates carrying value (see Note 10).
1138118_16_ITEM8_P120_S0	Senior Term Loans : Based upon information from third-party banks (which falls within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy), the estimated fair value of our senior term loans was approximately $878.6 million and $645.1 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P120_S1	Their actual carrying value, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, totaled $877.9 million and $638.1 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively (see Note 10).
1138118_16_ITEM8_P121_S0	Interest Rate Swaps : These liabilities are carried at their fair value as calculated by using widely-accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative (see Note 6).
1138118_16_ITEM8_P122_S0	5.00% Senior Notes : Based on dealers quotes (which falls within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy), the estimated fair value of our 5.00% senior notes was $802.6 million and $818.0 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P122_S1	Their actual carrying value, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, totaled $789.1 million and $787.9 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively (see Note 10).
1138118_16_ITEM8_P123_S0	4.875% Senior Notes : On August 13, 2015, CBRE issued $600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due March 1, 2026 (see Note 10).
1138118_16_ITEM8_P123_S1	Based on dealers quotes (which falls within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy), the estimated fair value of our 4.875% senior notes was $598.8 million at December 31, 2015.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P123_S2	Their actual carrying value, net of unamortized discount and unamortized debt issuance costs, totaled $590.5 million at December 31, 2015.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P123_S3	5.25% Senior Notes : Based on dealers quotes (which falls within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy), the estimated fair value of our 5.25% senior notes was $430.4 million and $439.7 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P123_S4	Their actual carrying value, net of unamortized premium and unamortized debt issuance costs, totaled $422.0 million and $422.2 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively (see Note 10).
1138118_16_ITEM8_P123_S5	Notes Payable on Real Estate: As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the carrying value of our notes payable on real estate, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, was $38.3 million and $41.4 million, respectively.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P123_S6	These notes payable were not recourse to CBRE Group, Inc., except for being recourse to the single-purpose entities that held the real estate assets and were the primary obligors on the notes payable.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P124_S0	These borrowings have either fixed interest rates or floating interest rates at spreads added to a market index.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P125_S0	Although it is possible that certain portions of our notes payable on real estate may have fair values that differ from their carrying values, based on the terms of such loans as compared to current market conditions, or other factors specific to the borrower entity, we do not believe that the fair value of our notes payable is significantly different than their carrying value.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P126_S0	Derivative Financial Instruments We are exposed to certain risks arising from both our business operations and economic conditions.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P126_S1	We manage economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources and duration of our debt funding and by using derivative financial instruments.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P126_S2	Specifically, we enter into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the payment of future known but uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P126_S3	Our derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing and duration of our known or expected cash payments principally related to our borrowings.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P127_S0	We do not net derivatives on our balance sheet.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P127_S1	Our objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P127_S2	To accomplish this objective, we primarily use interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P127_S3	In July 2015, we entered into three interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $300.0 million, all with effective dates in August 2015, and designated them as cash flow hedges in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging .
1138118_16_ITEM8_P127_S4	We structured these swap agreements to attempt to hedge the variability of future interest payments due to changes in interest rates prior to us issuing the 4.875% senior notes (see Note 10).
1138118_16_ITEM8_P127_S5	There was no hedge ineffectiveness for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P127_S6	In August 2015, we elected to terminate these agreements and paid a $6.2 million cash settlement, which has been recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and is being amortized to interest expense throughout the remaining term of the terminated hedge transaction until August 2025.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P127_S7	We reclassified $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P127_S8	During the next twelve months, we estimate that $0.6 million will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P128_S0	In March 2011, we entered into five interest rate swap agreements, all with effective dates in October 2011, and immediately designated them as cash flow hedges in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P128_S1	The purpose of these interest rate swap agreements is to attempt to hedge potential changes to our cash flows due to the variable interest nature of our senior term loan facilities.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P128_S2	The total notional amount of these interest rate swap agreements is $400.0 million, with $200.0 million expiring in October 2017 and $200.0 million expiring in September 2019.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P129_S0	The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P129_S1	There was no significant hedge ineffectiveness for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P130_S0	The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the balance sheet and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P130_S1	We reclassified $11.9 million, $12.0 million and $11.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P130_S2	During the next twelve months, we estimate that $9.8 million will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P130_S3	In addition, we recorded net losses (gains) of $6.5 million, $9.9 million and ($7.1) million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, to other comprehensive income/loss in relation to such interest rate swap agreements.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P130_S4	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the fair values of such interest rate swap agreements were reflected as a $21.5 million liability and a $26.9 million liability, respectively, and were included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P131_S0	From time to time, we also enter into interest rate swap and cap agreements in order to limit our interest expense related to our notes payable on real estate.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P131_S1	If any of these agreements are not designated as effective hedges, then they are marked to market each period with the change in fair value recognized in current period earnings.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P132_S0	The net impact on our earnings resulting from gains and/or losses on interest rate swap and cap agreements associated with notes payable on real estate has not been significant.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P132_S1	Additionally, our foreign operations expose us to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P132_S2	These fluctuations may impact the value of our cash receipts and payments in terms of our functional (reporting) currency, which is U.S. dollars.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P132_S3	We enter into derivative financial instruments to attempt to protect the value or fix the amount of certain obligations in terms of our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P132_S4	In March 2014, we began a foreign currency exchange forward hedging program by entering into foreign currency exchange forward contracts, including agreements to buy U.S. dollars and sell Australian dollars, British pound sterling, Canadian dollars, euros and Japanese yen.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P132_S5	The purpose of these forward contracts is to attempt to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that would adversely impact some of our foreign currency denominated EBITDA.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P132_S6	Hedge accounting was not elected for any of these contracts.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P132_S7	As such, changes in the fair values of these contracts are recorded directly in earnings.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P133_S0	Included in the consolidated statement of operations were net gains of $24.2 million and $5.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, resulting from net gains on foreign currency exchange forward contracts.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P133_S1	As of December 31, 2015, we had 73 foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding covering a notional amount of $407.0 million.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P133_S2	As of December 31, 2015, the fair value of forward contracts with six counterparties aggregated to an $8.9 million asset position, which was included in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P133_S3	As of December 31, 2015, the fair value of forward contracts with two counterparties aggregated to a $1.1 million liability position, which was included in other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P133_S4	As of December 31, 2014, the fair value of forward contracts with two counterparties aggregated to a $0.5 million asset position, which was included in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P133_S5	As of December 31, 2014, the fair value of forward contracts with four counterparties aggregated to a $1.3 million liability position, which was included in other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P134_S0	exposure to such transactions, as appropriate.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P134_S1	In the ordinary course of business, we also sometimes utilize derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange contracts to attempt to mitigate foreign currency exchange exposure resulting from intercompany loans.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P134_S2	The net impact on our financial position and earnings resulting from these foreign currency exchange forward and options contracts has not been significant.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P135_S0	We also enter into loan commitments that relate to the origination of commercial mortgage loans that will be held for resale.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P135_S1	FASB ASC Topic 815 requires that these commitments be recorded at their fair values as derivatives.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P135_S2	Included in the consolidated statements of operations were net gains of $21.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, resulting from these loan commitments.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P135_S3	As of December 31, 2015, the fair value of such contracts with three counterparties aggregated to a $1.7 million asset position, which was included in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P136_S0	The net impact on our financial position and earnings resulting from gains and/or losses associated with these loan commitments during the year ended December 31, 2014 was not significant.

1138118_16_ITEM8_P136_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded an impairment loss related to property and equipment of $8.6 million (see Note 5 for additional information).
1138118_16_ITEM8_P136_S3	We did not recognize an impairment loss related to property and equipment in 2015 and 2013.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P137_S0	The following table summarizes the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands): On December 23, 2013, we completed the Norland Acquisition by acquiring 100% of the outstanding stock of London-based Norland, which fortified our real estate outsourcing platform in Europe within our EMEA segment.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P137_S1	The purchase price for the Norland Acquisition was approximately $474 million, with $433.9 million paid at closing and the remaining contingent consideration of $40.0 million paid in July 2014.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P137_S2	The Norland Acquisition was financed with cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P137_S3	On December 23, 2013, we also issued an aggregate of 362,916 shares of non-vested Class A common stock to certain members of senior management of Norland in connection with this acquisition.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P138_S0	Unaudited pro forma results, assuming the Norland Acquisition had occurred as of January 1, 2013 for purposes of the 2013 pro forma disclosures, are presented below.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P138_S1	They include certain adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2013, including $39.9 million of increased amortization expense as a result of intangible assets acquired in the Norland Acquisition, $1.1 million of additional interest expense as a result of debt incurred to finance the Norland Acquisition, and the tax impact of the pro forma adjustments.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P138_S2	These unaudited pro forma results for the year ended December 31, 2013 have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of what operating results would have been had the Norland Acquisition occurred on January 1, 2013 and may not be indicative of future operating results (dollars in thousands, except share data): During 2015, we completed eight in-fill acquisitions, including a Seattle-based leader in capital markets services for affordable housing, a Texas-based commercial real estate firm specializing in retail services, an energy management specialist based in Brookfield, Wisconsin, a Chicago-based location data analytics firm, one of the leading retail real estate services firms in the midwestern United States, an advisory, consulting and research firm specializing in the Canadian hospitality and tourism industries and our former independent affiliate companies in Columbia, South Carolina, and Memphis, Tennessee.

1138118_16_ITEM8_P139_S1	We performed the 2015, 2014 and 2013 assessments as of October 1.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P139_S2	When we performed our required annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we determined that no impairment existed as the estimated fair value of our reporting units was in excess of their carrying value.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P140_S0	Other intangible assets totaled $1.5 billion and $802.4 million, net of accumulated amortization of $589.2 million and $463.4 million, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and are comprised of the following (dollars in thousands):

1138118_16_ITEM8_P153_S0	In January 2015, we used the proceeds from the tranche A term loan facility under the 2015 Credit Agreement and from the December 2014 issuance of $125.0 million of 5.25% senior notes due 2025, along with cash on hand, to pay off the prior tranche A and tranche B term loans and the balance on our revolving credit facility under the 2013 Credit Agreement.

1138118_16_ITEM8_P170_S1	We believe that any losses in excess of the amounts accrued therefor as liabilities on our financial statements are unlikely to be significant, but litigation is inherently uncertain and there is the potential for a material adverse effect on our financial statements if one or more matters are resolved in a particular period in an amount materially in excess of what we anticipated.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P171_S0	Our leases generally relate to office space that we occupy, have varying terms and expire at various dates through 2030.

1138118_16_ITEM8_P174_S1	Under the DUS Program, CBRE MCI originates, underwrites, closes and services loans without prior approval by Fannie Mae, and in selected cases, is subject to sharing up to one-third of any losses on loans originated under the DUS Program.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P174_S2	CBRE MCI has funded loans subject to such loss sharing arrangements with unpaid principal balances of $12.4 billion at December 31, 2015.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P175_S0	CBRE MCI, under its agreement with Fannie Mae, must post cash reserves or other acceptable collateral under formulas established by Fannie Mae to provide for sufficient capital in the event losses occur.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P175_S1	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, CBRE MCI had a $35.0 million and a $29.0 million, respectively, letter of credit under this reserve arrangement, and had provided approximately $21.8 million and $16.8 million, respectively, of loan loss accruals.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P175_S2	Fannie Mae s recourse under the DUS Program is limited to the assets of CBRE MCI, which assets totaled approximately $524.4 million (including $370.3 million of warehouse receivables, a substantial majority of which are pledged against warehouse lines of credit and are therefore not available to Fannie Mae) at December 31, 2015.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P175_S3	We had outstanding letters of credit totaling $44.0 million as of December 31, 2015, excluding letters of credit for which we have outstanding liabilities already accrued on our consolidated balance sheet related to our subsidiaries outstanding reserves for claims under certain insurance programs as well as letters of credit related to operating leases.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P175_S4	CBRE MCI s letter of credit totaling $35.0 million referred to in the preceding paragraph represented the majority of the $44.0 million outstanding letters of credit.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P175_S5	The remaining letters of credit are primarily executed by us in the ordinary course of business and expire at varying dates through September 2016.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P175_S6	We had guarantees totaling $40.6 million as of December 31, 2015, excluding guarantees related to pension liabilities, consolidated indebtedness and other obligations for which we have outstanding liabilities already accrued on our consolidated balance sheet, and excluding guarantees related to operating leases.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P175_S7	The $40.6 million primarily represents guarantees executed by us in the ordinary course of business, including various guarantees of management and vendor contracts in our operations overseas, which expire at the end of each of the respective agreements.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P175_S8	In addition, as of December 31, 2015, we had issued numerous non-recourse carveout, completion and budget guarantees relating to development projects for the benefit of third parties.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P175_S9	These guarantees are commonplace in our industry and are made by us in the ordinary course of our Development Services business.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P175_S10	Non-recourse carveout guarantees generally require that our project-entity borrower not commit specified improper acts, with us potentially liable for all or a portion of such entity s indebtedness or other damages suffered by the lender if those acts occur.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P176_S0	Completion and budget guarantees generally require us to complete construction of the relevant project within a specified timeframe and/or within a specified budget, with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P176_S1	However, we generally use guaranteed maximum price contracts with reputable, bondable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P176_S2	These contracts are intended to pass the risk to such contractors.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P176_S3	While there can be no assurance, we do not expect to incur any material losses under these guarantees.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P177_S0	An important part of the strategy for our Global Investment Management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P177_S1	These co-investments generally total up to 2.0% of the equity in a particular fund.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P177_S2	As of December 31, 2015, we had aggregate commitments of $12.8 million to fund future co-investments.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P177_S3	Additionally, an important part of our Development Services business strategy is to invest in unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries as a principal (in most cases co-investing with our clients).
1138118_16_ITEM8_P177_S4	As of December 31, 2015, we had committed to fund $29.6 million of additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P178_S0	Employee Benefit Plans Stock Incentive Plans Second Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P178_S1	Our 2004 stock incentive plan was adopted by our board of directors and approved by our stockholders on April 21, 2004, and was amended several times subsequently.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P178_S2	The 2004 stock incentive plan authorized the grant of stock-based awards to our employees, directors or independent contractors.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P178_S3	However, our 2004 stock incentive plan was terminated in May 2012 in connection with the adoption of our 2012 equity incentive plan, which is described below.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P178_S4	At termination, all unissued shares from the 2004 stock incentive plan were allocated to the 2012 equity incentive plan for potential future issuance.

1138118_16_ITEM8_P190_S2	The 401(k) Plan provides for participant contributions as well as a Company match.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P190_S3	A participant is allowed to contribute to the 401(k) Plan from 1% to 75% of his or her compensation, subject to limits imposed by applicable law.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P190_S4	Effective January 1, 2007, all participants hired post January 1, 2007 vest in company match contributions 20% per year for each plan year they work 1,000 hours.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P190_S5	All participants hired before January 1, 2007 are immediately vested in company match contributions.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P190_S6	For 2015, 2014, and 2013, we contributed a 50% match on the first 5%, 4% and 3%, respectively, of annual compensation (up to $150,000 of compensation) deferred by each participant.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P190_S7	In connection with the 401(k) Plan, we charged to expense $29.0 million, $21.3 million and $15.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P191_S0	Participants are entitled to invest up to 25% of their 401(k) account balance in shares of our common stock.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P191_S1	As of December 31, 2015, approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock were held as investments by participants in our 401(k) Plan.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P192_S0	We have two contributory defined benefit pension plans in the U.K.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P192_S1	The London-based firm of Hillier Parker May Rowden, which we acquired in 1998, had a contributory defined benefit pension plan.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P192_S2	A subsidiary of Insignia, which we acquired in connection with the Insignia Acquisition in 2003, also had a contributory defined benefit pension plan in the U.K.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P192_S3	Our subsidiaries based in the U.K. maintain the plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in these plans.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P192_S4	With respect to these plans, our historical policy has been to contribute annually to the plans, an amount to fund pension liabilities as actuarially determined and as required by applicable laws and regulations.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P192_S5	Our contributions to these plans are invested by the plan trustee and, if these investments do not perform well in the future, we may be required to provide additional contributions to cover any pension underfunding.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P192_S6	Effective July 1, 2007, we reached agreements with the active members of these plans to freeze future pension plan benefits.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P192_S7	In return, the active members became eligible to enroll in a defined contribution plan.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P193_S0	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the fair values of pension plan assets were $305.5 million and $328.3 million, respectively, and the fair values of projected benefit obligations in aggregate were $377.5 million and $421.2 million, respectively.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P193_S1	As a result, the plans were underfunded by approximately $72.0 million and $92.9 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and were recorded as net liabilities included in other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P193_S2	Items not yet recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost (benefit) were $132.8 million and $141.9 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and were included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P193_S3	Net periodic pension cost (benefit) was not material for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P194_S0	The components of income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes consisted of the following (dollars in thousands): Our tax provision (benefit) consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_16_ITEM8_P194_S1	The following is a reconciliation stated as a percentage of pre-tax income of the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate:
1138118_16_ITEM8_P195_S0	During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, we recorded a $3.2 million, $2.2 million and $10.5 million income tax benefit in connection with stock options exercised.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P195_S1	Of this income tax benefit, $2.3 million, $1.2 million and $9.9 million was charged directly to additional paid-in capital within the equity section of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P195_S2	Cumulative tax effects of temporary differences are shown below at December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):
1138118_16_ITEM8_P196_S0	As of December 31, 2015, we had U.S. federal net operating losses (NOLs) of approximately $33.7 million, translating to a deferred tax asset before valuation allowance of $11.8 million, which will begin to expire in 2023.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P196_S1	As of December 31, 2015, there were also deferred tax assets before valuation allowances of approximately $3.2 million related to state NOLs as well as $41.8 million related to foreign NOLs.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P196_S2	The state and foreign NOLs both begin to expire in 2016, but the majority carry forward indefinitely.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P197_S0	The utilization of NOLs may be subject to certain limitations under U.S. federal, state and foreign laws.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P197_S1	In addition, as of December 31, 2015, we had $54.0 million of foreign income tax credits that can be utilized to offset U.S. federal income taxes on foreign-sourced earnings.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P197_S2	These credits are scheduled to expire in 2023.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P198_S0	We determined that as of December 31, 2015, $91.7 million of deferred tax assets do not satisfy the realization criteria set forth in Topic 740.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P198_S1	Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been recorded for this amount.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P198_S2	If released, the entire amount would result in a benefit to continuing operations.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P198_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2015, our valuation allowance decreased by approximately $1.8 million.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P198_S4	This resulted from $3.2 million of non-U.S. net operating loss utilization, $2.8 million of foreign currency translation, a reduction of historical non-U.S. net operating loss balances by $2.1 million and $1.9 million related to the release of valuation allowance on U.S. net operating losses and other assets.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P198_S5	These decreases were partially offset by establishment of valuation allowances of $6.9 million related to non-U.S. net operating losses and other foreign assets and $1.3 million related to U.S. net operating losses and other U.S. assets.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P198_S6	We believe it is more likely than not that future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets recorded net of these valuation allowances.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P199_S0	Our foreign subsidiaries have accumulated $1.4 billion of undistributed earnings for which we have not recorded a deferred tax liability.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P199_S1	Although tax liabilities might result from dividends being paid out of these earnings, or as a result of a sale or liquidation of non-U.S. subsidiaries, these earnings are permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. and we do not have any plans to repatriate them or to sell or liquidate any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P199_S2	To the extent that we are able to repatriate the earnings in a tax efficient manner, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds, net of foreign tax credits.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P199_S3	Determining our tax liability upon repatriation is not practicable.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P199_S4	Cash and cash equivalents owned by non-U.S. subsidiaries totaled $315.5 million at December 31, 2015.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P199_S5	In 2013, we repatriated $196.2 million.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P199_S6	Tax benefits associated with the release of valuation allowances on foreign tax credits of $14.5 million and $4.9 million were recorded in 2013 and 2014, respectively.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P199_S7	The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $92.5 million and $67.0 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P199_S8	The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect our effective tax rate, if recognized, is $43.8 million ($40.7 million, net of federal benefit received from state positions) and $37.6 million ($35.8 million, net of federal benefit received from state positions) as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P199_S9	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 is as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_16_ITEM8_P200_S0	We believe it is reasonably possible that between $2.0 million and $3.4 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits will be settled during the next twelve months due to filing amended returns and settling ongoing exams.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P200_S1	Our continuing practice is to recognize potential accrued interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters within income tax expense.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P200_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we accrued an additional $3.2 million, $3.0 million and $2.6 million, respectively, in interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P200_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2014, we reversed $10.5 million of accrued interest and penalties related to settled positions.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P200_S4	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we have recognized a liability for interest and penalties of $28.8 million ($22.1 million, net of related federal benefit received from interest expense) and $25.5 million ($19.8 million, net of related federal benefit received from interest expense), respectively.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P201_S0	We conduct business globally and, as a result, one or more of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in multiple state, local and foreign jurisdictions.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P201_S1	We are no longer open to assessment by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for years prior to 2005.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P201_S2	With limited exception, our significant state and foreign tax jurisdictions are no longer subject to audit by the various tax authorities for tax years prior to 2007.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P202_S0	Our board of directors is authorized, subject to any limitations imposed by law, without the approval of our stockholders, to issue a total of 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, in one or more series, with each such series having rights and preferences including voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences, as our board of directors may determine.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P202_S1	We may repurchase shares awarded to certain grant recipients under our various equity compensation plans to satisfy minimum statutory federal, state and local tax withholding obligations arising from the vesting of their equity awards.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P202_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, 332,799, 242,461 and 601,917 shares, respectively, with an average price paid per share of $32.87, $31.31 and $22.00, respectively, were repurchased relating thereto.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P203_S0	The following is a calculation of income per share (dollars in thousands, except share data):
1138118_16_ITEM8_P203_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, 372,020, 58,631 and 72,580, respectively, of contingently issuable shares were excluded from the computation of diluted income per share because their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P203_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2013, options to purchase 51,426 shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted income per share.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P203_S3	These options were excluded because their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect given that the options exercise prices were greater than the average market price of our common stock for such period.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P204_S0	The accompanying consolidated balance sheets do not include the net assets of escrow, agency and fiduciary funds, which are held by us on behalf of clients and which amounted to $3.3 billion and $2.6 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P205_S0	Discontinued Operations On January 1, 2014, we adopted ASU 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, and as a result, no longer anticipate reporting discontinued operations in the ordinary course of our business.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P205_S1	Prior to January 1, 2014, if in the ordinary course of business we disposed of real estate assets, or held real estate assets for sale, that were considered components of an entity in accordance with Topic 360, and if we did not have, or expect to have, significant continuing involvement with the operation of these real estate assets after disposition, we were required to recognize operating profits or losses and gains or losses on disposition of these assets as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations in the periods in which they occurred.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P205_S2	Real estate operations and dispositions accounted for as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 were reported in our Global Investment Management and Development Services segments and included the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_16_ITEM8_P206_S0	Segments We report our operations through the following segments: (1) Americas, (2) EMEA, (3) Asia Pacific, (4) Global Investment Management and (5) Development Services.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P207_S0	The Americas segment is our largest segment of operations and provides a comprehensive range of services throughout the U.S. and in the largest regions of Canada and key markets in Latin America.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P207_S1	The primary services offered consist of the following: real estate services, mortgage loan origination and servicing, valuation services, asset services and occupier outsourcing services.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P207_S2	Our EMEA and Asia Pacific segments provide services similar to the Americas business segment.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P207_S3	The EMEA segment has operations primarily in Europe, while the Asia Pacific segment has operations in Asia, Australia and New Zealand.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P208_S0	Our Global Investment Management business provides investment management services to clients seeking to generate returns and diversification through direct and indirect investments in real estate in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P208_S1	Our Development Services business consists of real estate development and investment activities primarily in the U.S. Summarized financial information by segment is as follows (dollars in thousands): EBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P208_S2	EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and when analyzing our operating performance, investors should use EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P208_S3	Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P209_S0	We generally use EBITDA to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes, and we believe that this measure provides a more complete understanding of ongoing operations, enhances comparability of current results to prior periods.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P209_S1	We further believe that investors may find EBITDA useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because EBITDA calculations generally eliminate the effects of acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions, the effects of financings and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P210_S0	EBITDA may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P211_S0	EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our discretionary use because it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P211_S1	EBITDA may also differ from the amount calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which amounts are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P212_S0	Net interest expense and write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt have been expensed in the segment incurred.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P212_S1	Provision for income taxes has been allocated among our segments by using applicable U.S. and foreign effective tax rates.
1138118_16_ITEM8_P212_S2	EBITDA for our segments is calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_16_ITEM8_P213_S0	(1) Includes depreciation and amortization related to discontinued operations of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.

1138118_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Securities Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f), including maintenance of (i) records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets, and (ii) policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance that (a) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, (b) our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our Board of Directors and (c) we will prevent or timely detect unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1138118_16_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control.
1138118_16_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses of judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.
1138118_16_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper overriding of controls.
1138118_16_ITEM9A_P1_S3	As a result of such limitations, there is risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
1138118_16_ITEM9A_P1_S4	However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
1138118_16_ITEM9A_P1_S5	Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
1138118_16_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission.
1138118_16_ITEM9A_P2_S1	We acquired Johnson Control Inc. s Global Workplace Solutions business during 2015 ( Acquired Business ) as defined in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, and we excluded from our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, the Acquired Business s internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets of $2.3 billion and total revenues of $982.0 million included our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015.
1138118_16_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Based on our evaluation under the COSO framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2015.
1138118_16_ITEM9A_P2_S3	The effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.
1138118_16_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Disclosure Controls and Procedures Rule 13a-15 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires that we conduct an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report, and we have a disclosure policy in furtherance of the same.

1138118_16_ITEM9A_P3_S2	The evaluation is further designed to ensure that all information required to be disclosed in our SEC reports is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods and in the manner specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
1138118_16_ITEM9A_P3_S3	Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
1138118_16_ITEM9A_P3_S4	Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer supervise and participate in this evaluation, and they are assisted by our Deputy Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer and other members of our Disclosure Committee.
1138118_16_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Chief Accounting Officer, our Disclosure Committee consists of our General Counsel, the chief communication officer, our corporate controller, our head of Global Internal Audit, senior officers of significant business lines and other select employees.

1138118_16_ITEM9A_P4_S2	No changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

1138118_17_ITEM1_P1_S10	We believe we are well-positioned to capture a growing share of this business.

1138118_17_ITEM1_P8_S1	This mitigates the effect of compensation, our largest expense, on our operating margins during difficult market conditions.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P8_S2	We strive to retain top professionals through an attractive compensation program tied to productivity as well as greater investments in support resources, including professional development and training, market research and information, technology, branding and marketing, than most other firms in our sector.

1138118_17_ITEM1_P10_S2	We believe the outsourcing of commercial real estate services is a long-term trend in our industry, with occupiers, such as corporations, public sector entities, health care providers and others, achieving better execution and improved efficiency by relying on the expertise of third-party real estate specialists.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P10_S3	We typically enter into multi-year, often multi-service outsourcing contracts with our clients, and also provide services on a one-off assignment or a short-term contract basis.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	Facilities management involves the day-to-day management of client-occupied space and includes headquarter buildings, regional offices, administrative offices, data centers and other critical facilities, manufacturing and laboratory facilities, distribution facilities and retail space.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P11_S1	Contracts for facilities management services are often structured so we are reimbursed for client-dedicated personnel costs and subcontracted vendor costs as well as associated overhead expenses plus a monthly fee, and in some cases, annual incentives tied to agreed-upon performance targets, with any penalties typically capped.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	Project management services are typically provided on a portfolio-wide or programmatic basis.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P12_S1	Revenues for project management generally include fixed management fees, variable fees, and incentive fees if certain agreed-upon performance targets are met.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P12_S2	Revenues for project management may also include reimbursement of payroll and related costs for personnel providing the services.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	Property Management Through our Asset Services business line, we provide property management services on a contractual basis for owners/investors in office, industrial and retail properties.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P13_S1	These services include construction management, marketing, building engineering, accounting and financial services.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	We typically receive monthly management fees for the property management services we provide based upon a specified percentage of the monthly rental income or rental receipts generated from the property under management, or in certain cases, the greater of such percentage fee or a minimum agreed-upon fee.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P14_S1	We are also often reimbursed for our administrative and payroll costs, as well as certain out-of-pocket expenses, directly attributable to the properties under management.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P14_S2	Our management agreements with our property management services clients may be terminated by either party with notice generally ranging between 30 to 90 days; however, we have developed long-term relationships with many of these clients and the typical contract continues for multiple years.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P14_S3	We believe our contractual relationships with these clients put us in an advantageous position to provide other services to them, including leasing, refinancing, disposition and appraisal.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) Our Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, reporting segment serves clients in approximately 60 countries.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P15_S1	The largest operations are located in France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P15_S2	Our operations in these countries generally provide a full range of services to the commercial property sector.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P15_S3	Additionally, we provide some residential property services, focused on the prime and super-prime segments of the market, primarily in the United Kingdom.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P15_S4	Within EMEA, our services are organized along similar lines as in the Americas, including leasing, property sales, valuation services, asset management services and occupier outsourcing, among others.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P15_S5	Our EMEA segment accounted for 30.0% of our 2016 revenue, 27.7% of our 2015 revenue and 25.9% of our 2014 revenue.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	In several countries in EMEA, we have contractual relationships with independent affiliates that provide commercial real estate services under our brand name.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P16_S1	Our agreements with these independent affiliates include licenses by us to them to use the CBRE name in the relevant territory in return for payments of annual or quarterly royalty fees to us.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P16_S2	In addition, these agreements typically provide for the cross-referral of business between us and our affiliates.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	Asia Pacific Our Asia Pacific reporting segment serves clients in 16 countries.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P17_S1	Our largest operations in Asia are located in Greater China, India, Japan, Singapore and Thailand.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P17_S2	The Pacific region includes Australia and New Zealand.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P17_S3	Our operations in these countries provide a full range of real estate services to the commercial sector, similar to the services provided by our Americas and EMEA segments.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P17_S4	We also provide services to the residential property sector predominantly in the Pacific region.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P17_S5	In addition, we have contractual agreements with independent affiliates that generate royalty fees and support cross-referral arrangements similar to our EMEA segment.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	Our Asia Pacific segment accounted for 11.4% of our 2016 revenue, 10.5% of our 2015 revenue and 10.7% of our 2014 revenue.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	Global Investment Management Operations in our Global Investment Management reporting segment are conducted through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE Global Investors, LLC and its global affiliates, which we also refer to as CBRE Global Investors.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	CBRE Global Investors provides investment management services to pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, foundations, endowments and other institutional investors seeking to generate returns and diversification through investment in real estate.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P20_S1	It sponsors investment programs that span the risk/return spectrum in: North America, Europe, Asia and Australia.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P20_S2	In some strategies, CBRE Global Investors and its investment teams co-invest with its limited partners.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	CBRE Global Investors offerings are organized into four primary categories: (1) direct real estate investments through sponsored funds; (2) direct real estate investments through separate accounts; (3) indirect real estate and infrastructure investments through listed securities; and (4) indirect real estate investments through multi-manager investment programs.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	Assets under management, or AUM, totaled $86.6 billion at December 31, 2016 as compared to $89.0 billion at December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P22_S1	In local currency, AUM for 2016 was up $2.1 billion, but down $2.4 billion when measured in U.S dollars.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P22_S2	Our Global Investment Management segment accounted for 2.8% of our 2016 revenue, 4.2% of our 2015 revenue and 5.2% of our 2014 revenue.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	Development Services Operations in our Development Services reporting segment are conducted through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Trammell Crow Company, LLC, which we also refer to as Trammell Crow Company, and certain of its subsidiaries, providing development services primarily in the United States to users of and investors in commercial real estate, as well as for its own account.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P23_S1	Trammell Crow Company pursues opportunistic, risk-mitigated development and investment in commercial real estate across a wide spectrum of property types, including: industrial, office and retail properties; healthcare facilities of all types (medical office buildings, hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers); and residential/mixed-use projects.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P23_S2	Our Development Services segment accounted for 0.5% of our 2016 revenue, 0.6% of our 2015 revenue and 0.7% of our 2014 revenue.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	Trammell Crow Company pursues development and investment activity on behalf of its clients on a fee basis (with no ownership interest in a property), in partnership with its clients (through co-investment either on an individual project basis or through programs with certain strategic capital partners) or for its own account (100% ownership).
1138118_17_ITEM1_P24_S1	Development activity in which Trammell Crow Company has an ownership interest is conducted through subsidiaries that are consolidated or unconsolidated for financial reporting purposes, depending primarily on the extent and nature of our ownership interest.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P24_S2	At December 31, 2016, Trammell Crow Company had $6.6 billion of development projects in process.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P24_S3	Additionally, the inventory of pipeline deals (prospective projects we believe have a greater than 50% chance of closing or where land has been acquired and the projected construction start date is more than twelve months out) was $4.2 billion at December 31, 2016.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	Competition We compete across a variety of business lines within the commercial real estate industry, including commercial property, corporate facilities, project and transaction management, tenant/occupier and property/agency leasing, capital markets solutions (property sales, commercial mortgage origination, sales and servicing, and structured finance) real estate investment management, valuation, development services and proprietary research.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P25_S1	Each business line is highly competitive on an international, national, regional and local level.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P25_S2	Although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2016 revenue, our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographic markets, property types and services.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P25_S3	We face competition from other commercial real estate service providers that compete with us on a global, national, regional or local basis or within a market segment; outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have expanded their offerings from time to time; in-house corporate real estate departments and property owners/developers that self-perform real estate services; investment banking firms, investment managers and developers that compete with us to raise and place investment capital; and accounting/consulting firms that advise on real estate strategies.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P25_S4	Some of these firms may have greater financial resources than we do.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	Despite recent consolidation, the commercial real estate services industry remains highly fragmented and competitive.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P26_S1	Although many of our competitors are substantially smaller than we are, some of them are larger on a regional or local basis or have a stronger position in a specific market segment or service offering.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	primary competitors are other large national and global firms, such as Cushman Wakefield, JLL (formerly Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated), Colliers International Group Inc. , Savills plc and BGC Partners (which is the publicly traded parent of Newmark Grubb Knight Frank); market-segment specialists, such as Eastdil Secured, HFF, L.P., Marcus Millichap, Inc. and Walker Dunlop, Inc.; and firms with business lines that compete with our occupier outsourcing business.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	Seasonality A significant portion of our revenue is seasonal, which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	Historically, our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flow from operating activities tend to be lowest in the first quarter, and highest in the fourth quarter of each year.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P29_S1	Revenue, earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales, financing and leasing transactions prior to year-end.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P29_S2	Employees At December 31, 2016, excluding our independent affiliates, we had more than 75,000 employees worldwide, approximately 37% of whose costs are fully reimbursed by clients and are mostly in our Global Workplace Solutions and Asset Services lines of business.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P29_S3	At December 31, 2016, approximately 1,800 of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements, most of whom work in properties we manage in California, Illinois, New Jersey and New York.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	We hold various trademarks and trade names worldwide, which include the CBRE name.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P30_S1	Although we believe our intellectual property plays a role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve, we do not believe we would be materially, adversely affected by expiration or termination of our trademarks or trade names or the loss of any of our other intellectual property rights other than the CBRE and Trammell Crow Company names.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	We maintain trademark registrations for the CBRE service mark in jurisdictions where we conduct significant business.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P31_S1	We hold a license to use the Trammell Crow Company trade name pursuant to a license agreement with CF98, L.P., an affiliate of Crow Realty Investors, L.P., d/b/a Crow Holdings, which may be revoked if we fail to satisfy usage and quality control covenants under the license agreement.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	In addition to trademarks and trade names, we have acquired and developed proprietary technologies for the provision of complex services and analysis.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P32_S1	We also offer proprietary research to clients through CBRE Economic Advisors and we offer proprietary investment analysis and structures through CBRE Global Investors.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P33_S0	While we have not generally registered these items of intellectual property in any jurisdiction, we may seek to secure our rights under applicable intellectual property protection laws in these and any other proprietary assets that we use in our business.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	Environmental Matters Federal, state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business impose environmental liabilities, controls, disclosure rules and zoning restrictions that affect the ownership, management, development, use or sale of commercial real estate.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P34_S1	Certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability on current or previous real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating, cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property, including contamination resulting from above-ground or underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos or lead at a property.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	The operator of a site also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from exposure to hazardous substances or environmental contamination at a site, including liabilities arising from exposure to asbestos-containing materials.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	Under certain laws and common law principles, any failure by us to disclose environmental contamination at a property could subject us to liability to a buyer or lessee of the property.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P37_S1	Further, federal, state and local governments in the countries in which we do business have enacted various laws, regulations and treaties governing environmental and climate change, particularly for greenhouse gases, which seek to tax, penalize or limit their release.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P37_S2	Such regulations could lead to increased operational or compliance costs over time.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	While we are aware of the presence or the potential presence of regulated substances in the soil or groundwater at or near several properties owned, operated or managed by us that may have resulted from historical or ongoing activities on those properties, we are not aware of any material noncompliance with the environmental laws or regulations currently applicable to us, and we are not the subject of any material claim for liability with respect to contamination at any location.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P38_S1	However, these laws and regulations may discourage sales and leasing activities and mortgage lending with respect to some properties, which may adversely affect both the commercial real estate services industry in general and us.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P38_S2	Environmental contamination or other environmental liabilities may also negatively affect the value of commercial real estate assets held by entities that are managed by our investment management and development services businesses, which could adversely affect the results of operations of these business lines.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P38_S3	We use our website as a channel of distribution for company information, and financial and other material information regarding us is routinely posted and accessible on our website.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P39_S0	On the Investor Relations page of our website, we post the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC: our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P39_S1	We also make available through our website other reports filed with or furnished to the SEC under the Exchange Act, including reports filed by our officers and directors under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P39_S2	All of the information on our Investor Relations web page is available to be viewed free of charge.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P39_S3	Information contained on our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or our other filings with the SEC.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P39_S4	We assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless we are required to do so by law.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P39_S5	A copy of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is available without charge upon written request to: Investor Relations, CBRE Group, Inc., 200 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10166.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P39_S6	The SEC also maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P40_S0	Item 1A. Risk Factors Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report and other public statements we make.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P41_S0	However, the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P41_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial (but that later become material) may also adversely affect our business.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P41_S2	The success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and, accordingly, our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by economic slowdowns, liquidity crises, fiscal or political uncertainty and possible subsequent downturns in commercial real estate asset values, property sales and leasing activities in one or more of the geographies or industry sectors that we or our clients serve.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P41_S3	Periods of economic weakness or recession, significantly rising interest rates, fiscal or political uncertainty, market volatility, declining employment levels, declining demand for commercial real estate, falling real estate values, disruption to the global capital or credit markets or the public perception that any of these events may occur, may negatively affect the performance of some or all of our business lines.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P41_S4	Our business is significantly affected by generally prevailing economic conditions in the markets where we principally operate, which can result in a general decline in real estate acquisition, disposition and leasing activity, as well as a general decline in the value of commercial real estate and in rents, which in turn reduces revenue from asset services fees and commissions derived from property sales, leasing, valuation and financing, as well as revenues associated with development or investment management activities.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P41_S5	Our businesses could also suffer from political or economic disruptions that affect interest rates or liquidity or create financial, market or regulatory uncertainty.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P41_S6	For example, the U.K. s vote to withdraw from the European Union, commonly known as Brexit, and speculation about the terms and consequences of this exit or that of other European Union members has caused and may continue to cause market volatility and currency fluctuations and adversely impact our clients confidence, which may result in a deterioration in our U.K. and other European businesses as leasing and investing activity slow down.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P41_S7	Adverse economic conditions or political or regulatory uncertainty could also lead to a decline in property sales prices as well as a decline in funds invested in existing commercial real estate assets and properties planned for development, which in turn could reduce the commissions and fees that we earn.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P41_S8	In addition, our development and investment strategy often entails making co-investments alongside our investor clients.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P41_S9	During an economic downturn, capital for our investment activities is usually constrained and it may take longer for us to dispose of real estate investments or selling prices may be lower than originally anticipated.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P41_S10	As a result, the value of our commercial real estate investments may be reduced, and we could realize losses or diminished profitability.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P41_S11	In addition, economic downturns may reduce the amount of loan originations and related servicing by our Capital Markets business.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P42_S0	The performance of our asset services line of business depends upon how well the properties we manage perform.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P42_S1	This is because our fees are generally based on a percentage of rent collections from these properties.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P43_S0	Rent collections may be affected by many factors, including: (i) real estate and financial market conditions prevailing generally and locally; (ii) our ability to attract and retain creditworthy tenants, particularly during economic downturns; and (iii) the magnitude of defaults by tenants under their respective leases, which may increase during distressed economic conditions.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P44_S0	In continental Europe and Asia Pacific, the economies in certain countries can be fragile, which may adversely affect our financial performance.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P44_S1	Economic, political and regulatory uncertainty as well as significant changes and volatility in the financial markets and business environment, and in the global landscape, make it increasingly difficult for us to predict our financial performance into the future.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P44_S2	As a result, any guidance or outlook that we provide on our performance is based on then-current conditions, and there is a risk that such guidance may turn out to be inaccurate.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P45_S0	Adverse developments in the credit markets may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P45_S1	Our Global Investment Management, Development Services and Capital Markets (including property sales and mortgage and structured financing services) businesses are sensitive to credit cost and availability as well as marketplace liquidity.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P45_S2	Additionally, the revenues in all of our businesses are dependent to some extent on the overall volume of activity (and pricing) in the commercial real estate market.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P46_S0	Disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business of providing advisory services to owners, investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with the leasing, disposition and acquisition of property.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P46_S1	If our clients are unable to procure credit on favorable terms, there may be fewer completed leasing transactions, dispositions and acquisitions of property.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P46_S2	In addition, if purchasers of commercial real estate are not able to procure favorable financing resulting in the lack of disposition opportunities for our funds and projects, our Global Investment Management and Development Services businesses may be unable to generate incentive fees, and we may also experience losses of co-invested equity capital if the disruption causes a permanent decline in the value of investments made.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P46_S3	Our operations are subject to social, political and economic risks in foreign countries as well as foreign currency volatility.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P46_S4	We conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the United States and as a result, we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	During 2016, approximately 47% of our revenue was transacted in foreign currencies, the majority of which included the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Danish krone, euro, Hong Kong dollar, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Polish zloty, Singapore dollar, Swedish krona, Swiss franc and Thai baht.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may result in corresponding fluctuations in our assets under management for our Global Investment Management business, revenue and earnings.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P48_S1	Over time, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P48_S2	Due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P48_S3	For example, Brexit caused a significant decline in the value of the British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar during 2016 and negotiations with respect to the terms of the U.K. s withdrawal or other changes to the membership or policies of the European Union, or speculation about such events, may cause additional volatility in international currency markets.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P48_S4	In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P48_S5	Additional circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations include, but are not limited to, the following factors:
1138118_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	changes in U.S. laws or policies governing foreign trade or investment and use of foreign operations or workers, and any negative sentiments towards the United States as a result of any such changes to laws or policies.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P49_S1	We maintain anti-corruption and anti-money-laundering compliance programs and programs designed to enable us to comply with applicable government economic sanctions, embargoes and other import/export controls throughout the company.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P49_S2	But, coordinating our activities to deal with the broad range of complex legal and regulatory environments in which we operate presents significant challenges.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P49_S3	We may not be successful in complying with regulations in all situations and violations may result in criminal or civil sanctions, including material monetary fines, penalties, equitable remedies (including disgorgement), and other costs against us or our employees, and may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P49_S4	We have committed additional resources to expand our worldwide sales and marketing activities, to globalize our service offerings and products in select markets and to develop local sales and support channels.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P49_S5	If we are unable to successfully implement these plans, maintain adequate long-term strategies that successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P49_S6	In addition, we have penetrated, and seek to continue to enter into, emerging markets to further expand our global platform.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P49_S7	However, we may not be successful in effectively evaluating and monitoring the key business, operational, legal and compliance risks specific to those markets.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P49_S8	The political and cultural risks present in emerging countries could also harm our ability to successfully execute our operations or manage our businesses there.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P49_S9	Our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P49_S10	Our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees, including Robert E. Sulentic, our President and Chief Executive Officer.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P49_S11	Mr. Sulentic and certain other key employees are not parties to employment agreements with us.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P49_S12	We also are highly dependent upon the retention of our property sales and leasing professionals, who generate a significant amount of our revenues, as well as other revenue producing professionals.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P49_S13	The departure of any of our key employees, or the loss of a significant number of key revenue producers, if we are unable to quickly hire and integrate qualified replacements, could cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to suffer.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P49_S14	Competition for these personnel is significant and we may not be able to successfully recruit, integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P49_S15	In addition, the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified support personnel in all areas of our business.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P49_S16	We and our competitors use equity incentives and sign-on and retention bonuses to help attract, retain and incentivize key personnel.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P49_S17	As competition is significant for the services of such personnel, the expense of such incentives and bonuses may increase and we may be unable to attract or retain such personnel to the same extent that we have in the past.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P49_S18	Any significant decline in, or failure to grow, our stock price may result in an increased risk of loss of these key personnel.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P49_S19	Furthermore, shareholder influence on our compensation practices, including our ability to issue equity compensation, may decrease our ability to offer attractive compensation to key personnel and make recruiting, retaining and incentivizing such personnel more difficult.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P49_S20	If we are unable to attract and retain these qualified personnel, our growth may be limited and our business and operating results could suffer.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P50_S0	We have numerous local and global competitors across all of our business lines and the geographies that we serve, and further industry consolidation could lead to significant future competition.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P50_S1	We compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate services and investment industry, including commercial property, corporate facilities, project and transaction management, tenant/occupier and property/agency leasing, capital markets solutions (property sales, commercial mortgage brokerage, loan origination and servicing), real estate investment management, valuation, development services and proprietary research.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P50_S2	Although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2016 revenue, our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies, property types and services and business lines.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P50_S3	Depending on the geography, property type or service or business line, we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers and investment firms, including outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have expanded their offerings from time to time, in-house corporate real estate departments, developers, institutional lenders, insurance companies, investment banking firms, investment managers and accounting and consulting firms.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P50_S4	Some of these firms may have greater financial resources allocated to a particular geography, property type or service or business line than we have allocated to that geography, property type, service or business line.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P50_S5	In addition, future changes in laws could lead to the entry of other new competitors, such as financial institutions.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P51_S0	Although many of our existing competitors are local or regional firms that are smaller than we are, some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P51_S1	We are further subject to competition from large national and multi-national firms that have similar service and investment competencies to ours, and it is possible that further industry consolidation could lead to much larger and more formidable competitors globally or in the particular geographies, property types, service or business lines that we serve.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P51_S2	There is no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively, to maintain current fee levels or margins, or maintain or increase our market share.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P51_S3	Our growth has benefited significantly from acquisitions, which may not perform as expected and similar opportunities may not be available in the future.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P52_S0	A significant component of our growth over time has been generated by acquisitions.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P52_S1	Any future growth through acquisitions will depend in part upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions, which may not be available to us, as well as sufficient liquidity and credit to fund these acquisitions.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P52_S2	We may incur significant additional debt from time to time to finance any such acquisitions, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our then-existing indebtedness.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P52_S3	If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our then-existing debt, would increase.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P53_S0	Acquisitions involve risks that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired may prove incorrect.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P53_S1	Future acquisitions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transaction-related expenses, which include severance, lease termination, transaction and deferred financing costs, among others.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P54_S0	We have had, and may continue to experience, challenges in integrating operations and information technology systems acquired from other companies.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P54_S1	This could result in the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of our key employees or clients or those of the acquired operations.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P54_S2	The integration process itself may be disruptive to our business and the acquired company s businesses as it requires coordination of geographically diverse organizations and implementation of new accounting and information technology systems.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P55_S0	We believe that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on operating and net income.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P55_S1	Acquisitions also frequently involve significant costs related to integrating information technology and accounting and management services.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P55_S2	We complete acquisitions with the expectation that they will result in various benefits, including enhanced or more stable revenues, a strengthened market position, cross-selling opportunities, cost synergies, tax benefits and accretion to our adjusted income per share.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P55_S3	Achieving the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions is subject to a number of uncertainties, including the realization of accretive benefits in the timeframe anticipated and whether we can successfully integrate the acquired business.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P56_S0	result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management s time and energy, which could in turn materially and adversely affect our overall business, financial condition and operating results.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P56_S1	Our joint venture activities and affiliate program involve unique risks that are often outside of our control and that, if realized, could harm our business.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P56_S2	We have utilized joint ventures for commercial investments, select local brokerage and other affiliations both in the United States and internationally, and we may acquire interests in other joint ventures in the future.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P57_S0	Under our affiliate program, we enter into contractual relationships with local brokerage, asset services or other operations pursuant to which we license to that operation our name and make available certain of our resources, in exchange for a royalty or economic participation in that operation s revenue, profits or transactional activity.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P57_S1	In many of these joint ventures and affiliations, we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures or affiliates, and other participants or operators of affiliates may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P57_S2	In addition, the other participants and operators may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P57_S3	If a joint venture participant or affiliate acts contrary to our interest, it could harm our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P57_S4	Our real estate investment and co-investment activities in our Global Investment Management as well as Development Services businesses subject us to real estate investment risks which could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flow.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P57_S5	An important part of the strategy for our Global Investment Management business involves co-investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients, and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P57_S6	As of December 31, 2016, we had committed $31.6 million to fund future co-investments in our Global Investment Management business, $25.5 million of which is expected to be funded during 2017.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P57_S7	In addition to required future capital contributions, some of the co-investment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P57_S8	However, our debt instruments contain restrictions that may limit our ability to provide capital to the entities holding direct or indirect interests in co-investments.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P57_S9	The failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments, including damage to our reputation with our co-investment partners and clients, as well as the necessity of obtaining alternative funding from other sources that may be on disadvantageous terms for us and the other co-investors.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P57_S10	Participating as a co-investor is an important part of our Global Investment Management business, which might suffer if we were unable to make these investments.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P57_S11	Selective investment in real estate projects is an important part of our Development Services business strategy, and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P57_S12	As of December 31, 2016, we had nine real estate projects consolidated in our financial statements.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P57_S13	In addition, at December 31, 2016, we were involved as a principal (in most cases, co-investing with our clients) in approximately 60 unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries with invested equity of $121.9 million and had committed additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries of $23.0 million.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P57_S14	As of December 31, 2016, we also guaranteed outstanding notes payable of these unconsolidated subsidiaries with outstanding balances of $15.7 million.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P58_S0	During the ordinary course of our Development Services business, we provide numerous completion and budget guarantees requiring us to complete the relevant project within a specified timeframe and/or within a specified budget, with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P58_S1	While we generally have guaranteed maximum price contracts with reputable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees (which are intended to pass most of the risk to such contractors), there can be no assurance that we will not have to perform under any such guarantees.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P58_S2	If we are required to perform under a significant number of such guarantees, it could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P59_S0	Because the disposition of a single significant investment can affect our financial performance in any period, our real estate investment activities could cause fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flow.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P59_S1	In many cases, we have limited control over the timing of the disposition of these investments and the recognition of any related gain or loss, or incentive participation fee.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P59_S2	Poor performance of the investment programs that our Global Investment Management business manages would cause a decline in our revenue, net income and cash flow and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future programs.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P60_S0	The revenue, net income and cash flow generated by our Global Investment Management business can be volatile period over period, primarily due to the fact that management, transaction and incentive fees can vary as a result of market movements from one period to another.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P60_S1	In the event that any of the investment programs that our Global Investment Management business manages were to perform poorly, our revenue, net income and cash flow could decline because the value of the assets we manage would decrease, which would result in a reduction in some of our management fees, and our investment returns would decrease, resulting in a reduction in the incentive compensation we earn.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P60_S2	Moreover, we could experience losses on co-investments of our own capital in such programs as a result of poor performance.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P60_S3	Investors and potential investors in our programs continually assess our performance, and our ability to raise capital for existing and future programs and maintaining our current fee structure will depend on our continued satisfactory performance.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P60_S4	Our debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us, and in the event of a default, all of our borrowings would become immediately due and payable.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P60_S5	We have debt and related debt service obligations.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P60_S6	As of December 31, 2016, our total debt, excluding notes payable on real estate (which are generally nonrecourse to us) and warehouse lines of credit (which are recourse only to our wholly-owned subsidiary, CBRE Capital Markets, and are secured by our related warehouse receivables), was approximately $2.6 billion.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P60_S7	For the year ended December 31, 2016, our interest expense was approximately $144.9 million.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P60_S8	Our debt instruments, including our credit agreement, impose, and the terms of any future debt may impose, operating and other restrictions on us and many of our subsidiaries.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P60_S9	These restrictions affect, and in many respects limit or prohibit, our ability to:
1138118_17_ITEM1_P61_S0	finance ongoing operations, strategic acquisitions, investments or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest, including:
1138118_17_ITEM1_P62_S0	Our credit agreement currently requires us to maintain a minimum coverage ratio of EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) to total interest expense of 2.00x and a maximum leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) of 4.25x as of the end of each fiscal quarter.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P62_S1	Our coverage ratio of EBITDA to total interest expense was 12.73x for the year ended December 31, 2016, and our leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to EBITDA was 1.18x as of December 31, 2016.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P62_S2	Our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot give assurance that we will be able to meet those ratios when required.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P62_S3	We continue to monitor our projected compliance with these financial ratios and other terms of our credit agreement.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P62_S4	A breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our debt instruments.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P62_S5	If any such default occurs, the lenders under our credit agreement may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P62_S6	The lenders under our credit agreement also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P62_S7	In addition, a default under our credit agreement could trigger a cross default or cross acceleration under our other debt instruments.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P62_S8	Our credit agreement is jointly and severally guaranteed by us and substantially all of our material domestic subsidiaries.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P62_S9	We have limited restrictions on the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur, which may intensify the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our indebtedness.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P62_S10	In addition, in the event of a credit-ratings downgrade, our ability to borrow and the costs of that borrowing could be adversely affected.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P62_S11	Subject to the maximum amounts of indebtedness permitted by our credit agreement covenants, we are not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur, and so we may in the future incur such indebtedness in order to finance our operations and investments.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P62_S12	In addition, Moody s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard Poor s Ratings Services, rate our significant outstanding debt.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P62_S13	These ratings, and any downgrades of them, may affect our ability to borrow as well as the costs of our current and future borrowings.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P62_S14	A significant portion of our revenue is seasonal, which could cause our financial results to fluctuate significantly.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P63_S0	A significant portion of our revenue is seasonal.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P63_S1	Historically, our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flow from operating activities tend to be lowest in the first calendar quarter, and highest in the fourth calendar quarter of each year.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P63_S2	Earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales, financing and leasing transactions prior to calendar year-end.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P63_S3	This variance among periods makes it difficult to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P63_S4	In addition, as a result of the seasonal nature of our business, political, economic or other unforeseen disruptions occurring in the fourth quarter that impact our ability to close large transactions may have a disproportionate effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P63_S5	We are subject to various litigation risks and may face financial liabilities and/or damage to our reputation as a result of litigation.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P64_S0	Our businesses are exposed to various litigation risks.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P64_S1	In addition, although we maintain insurance coverage for most of this risk, insurance coverage is unavailable at commercially reasonable pricing for certain types of exposures.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P64_S2	Accordingly, an adverse result in a litigation against us, or a lawsuit that results in a substantial legal liability for us (and particularly a lawsuit that is not insured), could have a disproportionate and material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P64_S3	In addition, we depend on our business relationships and our reputation for high-caliber professional services to attract and retain clients.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P64_S4	As a result, allegations against us, irrespective of the ultimate outcome of that allegation, may harm our professional reputation and as such materially damage our business and its prospects.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P65_S0	A failure to appropriately deal with actual or perceived conflicts of interest could adversely affect our businesses.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P65_S1	Our company has a global platform with different business lines and a broad client base and is therefore subject to numerous potential, actual or perceived conflicts of interests in the provision of services to our existing and potential clients.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P65_S2	For example, conflicts may arise from our position as broker to both owners and tenants in commercial real estate lease transactions.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P65_S3	We have adopted various policies, controls and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts, but these policies and procedures may not be adequate and may not be adhered to by our employees.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P65_S4	Appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged and cause us to lose existing clients or fail to gain new clients if we fail, or appear to fail, to identify, disclose and manage potential conflicts of interest, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P65_S5	In addition, it is possible that in some jurisdictions regulations could be changed to limit our ability to act for parties where conflicts exist even with informed consent, which could limit our market share in those markets.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P66_S0	There can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P66_S1	Failure to maintain and execute information technology strategies and ensure that our employees adapt to changes in technology could materially and adversely affect our ability to remain competitive in the market.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P67_S0	Our business relies heavily on information technology to deliver services that meet the needs of our clients.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P67_S1	If we are unable to effectively execute our information technology strategies or adopt new technologies and processes relevant to our service platform, our ability to deliver high-quality services may be materially impaired.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P67_S2	In addition, we make significant investments in new systems and tools to achieve competitive advantages and efficiencies.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P67_S3	Implementation of such investments in information technology could exceed estimated budgets and we may experience challenges that prevent new strategies or technologies from being realized according to anticipated schedules.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P67_S4	If we are unable to maintain current information technology and processes or encounter delays, or fail to exploit new technologies, then the execution of our business plans may be disrupted.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P67_S5	Similarly, our employees require effective tools and techniques to perform functions integral to our business.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P67_S6	Failure to successfully provide such tools and systems, or ensure that employees have properly adopted them, could materially and adversely impact our ability to achieve positive business outcomes.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P67_S7	Failure to maintain the security of our information and technology networks, including personally identifiable and client information, intellectual property and proprietary business information could significantly adversely affect us.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P67_S8	Security breaches and other disruptions of our information and technology networks could compromise our information and intellectual property and expose us to liability, reputational harm and significant remediation costs, which could cause material harm to our business and financial results.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P68_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and intellectual property, and that of our clients and personally identifiable information of our employees and contractors, in our data centers and on our networks.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P68_S1	The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information are critical to our operations.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P68_S2	Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by third parties or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P68_S3	A significant actual or potential theft, loss, corruption, exposure, fraudulent use or misuse of client, employee or other personally identifiable or proprietary business data, whether by third parties or as a result of employee malfeasance or otherwise, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or intellectual property or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could result in significant remediation and other costs, fines, litigation or regulatory actions against us.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P68_S4	Such an event could additionally disrupt our operations and the services we provide to clients, damage our reputation, result in the loss of a competitive advantage, impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial data and cause a loss of confidence in our services and financial reporting, which could adversely affect our business, revenues, competitive position and investor confidence.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P69_S0	providers, including cloud storage solution providers, resulting in less direct control over our data.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P69_S1	Such third parties are also vulnerable to security breaches and compromised security systems, for which we may not be indemnified and which could materially adversely affect us and our reputation.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P69_S2	Interruption or failure of our information technology, communications systems or data services could impair our ability to provide our services effectively, which could damage our reputation and materially harm our operating results.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P69_S3	Our business requires the continued operation of information technology and communication systems and network infrastructure.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P69_S4	Our ability to conduct our global business may be materially adversely affected by disruptions to these systems or infrastructure.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P69_S5	Our information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or disruption from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, system malfunctions, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and floods, acts of war or terrorism, employee errors or malfeasance, or other events which are beyond our control.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P69_S6	In addition, the operation and maintenance of these systems and networks is in some cases dependent on third-party technologies, systems and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P69_S7	Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays and loss, corruption or exposure of critical data or intellectual property and may also disrupt our ability to provide services to or interact with our clients, and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication or travel.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P69_S8	Furthermore, any such event could result in substantial recovery and remediation costs and liability to customers, business partners and other third parties.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P69_S9	We have disaster recovery plans and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events, but our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient and cannot account for all eventualities, and a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations, and as a result, our future operating results could be materially adversely affected.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P69_S10	The infrastructure disruptions we describe above may also disrupt our ability to manage real estate for clients or may adversely affect the value of real estate investments we make on behalf of clients.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P70_S0	The buildings we manage for clients, which include some of the world s largest office properties and retail centers, are used by numerous people daily.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P70_S1	As a result, fires, earthquakes, floods, other natural disasters, defects and terrorist attacks can result in significant loss of life, and, to the extent we are held to have been negligent in connection with our management of the affected properties, we could incur significant financial liabilities and reputational harm.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P71_S0	Our business relies heavily on the use of commercial real estate data.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P71_S1	A portion of this data is purchased or licensed from third-party providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P71_S2	A disruption of our ability to provide data to our professionals and/or our clients or an inadvertent exposure of proprietary data could damage our reputation and competitive position, and our operating results could be adversely affected.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P71_S3	Our goodwill and other intangible assets could become impaired, which may require us to take significant non-cash charges against earnings.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P71_S4	Under current accounting guidelines, we must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P71_S5	Any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of such analysis would result in a non-cash charge against earnings, and such charge could materially adversely affect our reported results of operations, stockholders equity and our stock price.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P71_S6	A significant and sustained decline in our future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the economic environment, slower growth rates or if our stock price falls below our net book value per share for a sustained period, could result in the need to perform additional impairment analysis in future periods.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P71_S7	If we were to conclude that a future write-down of goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary, then we would record such additional charges, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P72_S0	Our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected by new laws or regulations or by changes in existing laws or regulations or the application thereof.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P72_S1	If we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us, or make incorrect determinations in complex tax regimes, we may incur significant financial penalties.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P72_S2	We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations specific to the services we perform in our business.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P72_S3	Brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions and the provision of asset services and valuation services require us and our employees to maintain applicable licenses in each U.S. state and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we perform these services.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P72_S4	If we and our employees fail to maintain our licenses or conduct these activities without a license, or violate any of the regulations covering our licenses, we may be required to pay fines (including treble damages in certain states) or return commissions received or have our licenses suspended or revoked.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P72_S5	A number of our services, including the services provided by our indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, CBRE Capital Markets and CBRE Global Investors, are subject to regulation by the SEC, FINRA or other self-regulatory organizations and state securities regulators and compliance failures or regulatory action could adversely affect our business.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P72_S6	We could be subject to disciplinary or other actions in the future due to claimed noncompliance with these regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P72_S7	We are also subject to laws of broader applicability, such as tax, securities, environmental and employment laws, including the Fair Labor Standards Act, occupational health and safety regulations and U.S. state wage-and-hour laws.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P72_S8	Failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of significant fines by governmental authorities, awards of damages to private litigants and significant amounts paid in legal fees or settlements of these matters.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P73_S0	We operate in many jurisdictions with complex and varied tax regimes, and are subject to different forms of taxation resulting in a variable effective tax rate.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P73_S1	In addition, from time to time we engage in transactions across different tax jurisdictions.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P74_S0	Due to the different tax laws in the many jurisdictions where we operate, we are often required to make subjective determinations.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P74_S1	The tax authorities in the various jurisdictions where we carry on business may not agree with the determinations that are made by us with respect to the application of tax law.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P74_S2	Such disagreements could result in disputes and, ultimately, in the payment of additional funds to the government authorities in the jurisdictions where we carry on business, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P74_S3	In addition, changes in tax rules or the outcome of tax assessments and audits could have an adverse effect on our results in any particular quarter.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P75_S0	As the size and scope of our business has increased significantly during the past several years, both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with numerous licensing and other regulatory requirements and the possible loss resulting from non-compliance have increased.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P75_S1	The global economic crisis has resulted in increased government and legislative activities, including the introduction of new legislation and changes to rules and regulations, which we expect will continue into the future.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P75_S2	New or revised legislation or regulations applicable to our business, both within and outside of the United States, as well as changes in administrations or enforcement priorities may have an adverse effect on our business, including increasing the costs of regulatory compliance or preventing us from providing certain types of services in certain jurisdictions or in connection with certain transactions or clients.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P75_S3	We are unable to predict how any of these new laws, rules, regulations and proposals will be implemented or in what form, or whether any additional or similar changes to laws or regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, will occur in the future.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P75_S4	Any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P76_S0	We may be subject to environmental liability as a result of our role as a property or facility manager or developer of real estate.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P77_S0	Various laws and regulations impose liability on real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating, cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P78_S0	our role as a property or facility manager or developer, we could be held liable as an operator for such costs.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P78_S1	This liability may be imposed without regard to the legality of the original actions and without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P78_S2	If we fail to disclose environmental issues, we could also be liable to a buyer or lessee of a property.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P78_S3	If we incur any such liability, our business could suffer significantly as it could be difficult for us to develop or sell such properties, or borrow funds using such properties as collateral.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P78_S4	In the event of a substantial liability, our insurance coverage might be insufficient to pay the full damages, or the scope of available coverage may not cover certain of these liabilities.
1138118_17_ITEM1_P78_S5	Additionally, liabilities incurred to comply with more stringent future environmental requirements could adversely affect any or all of our lines of business.

1138118_17_ITEM1_P82_S5	Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None.
1138118_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	Some of our offices house employees from our Global Investment Management and Development Services segments as well as employees from our other business segments.
1138118_17_ITEM2_P0_S1	We have provided above office totals by geographic region rather than by business segment in order to avoid double counting our Global Investment Management and Development Services offices.
1138118_17_ITEM2_P0_S2	In general, these leased offices are fully utilized.
1138118_17_ITEM2_P1_S0	The most significant terms of the leasing arrangements for our offices are the length of the lease and the rent.
1138118_17_ITEM2_P1_S1	Our leases have terms varying in duration.
1138118_17_ITEM2_P1_S2	The rent payable under our office leases varies significantly from location to location as a result of differences in prevailing commercial real estate rates in different geographic locations.
1138118_17_ITEM2_P2_S0	Our management believes that no single office lease is material to our business, results of operations or financial condition.
1138118_17_ITEM2_P2_S1	In addition, we believe there is adequate alternative office space available at acceptable rental rates to meet our needs, although adverse movements in rental rates in some markets may negatively affect our profits in those markets when we enter into new leases.
1138118_17_ITEM2_P2_S2	We do not own any of these offices.
1138118_17_ITEM2_P2_S3	Legal Proceedings We are a party to a number of pending or threatened lawsuits arising out of, or incident to, our ordinary course of business.
1138118_17_ITEM2_P2_S4	We believe that any losses in excess of the amounts accrued therefor as liabilities on our financial statements are unlikely to be significant, but litigation is inherently uncertain and there is the potential for a material adverse effect on our financial statements if one or more matters are resolved in a particular period in an amount materially in excess of what we anticipated.
1138118_17_ITEM5_P0_S0	the last two fiscal years, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange, are set forth below for the periods indicated.
1138118_17_ITEM5_P1_S0	The closing share price for our Class A common stock on December 31, 2016, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange, was $31.49.
1138118_17_ITEM5_P1_S1	As of February 13, 2017, there were 69 stockholders of record of our Class A common stock.
1138118_17_ITEM5_P1_S2	We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on any class of our common stock since our inception on February 20, 2001, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.
1138118_17_ITEM5_P1_S3	We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance future growth and possibly reduce debt or repurchase common stock.
1138118_17_ITEM5_P1_S4	Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, acquisition or other opportunities to invest capital, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors that the board of directors deems relevant.
1138118_17_ITEM5_P1_S5	In addition, our ability to declare and pay cash dividends is restricted by the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility and senior term loan facilities.
1138118_17_ITEM5_P2_S0	Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities None.

1138118_17_ITEM5_P11_S0	The following table sets forth our selected historical consolidated financial information for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 2016.
1138118_17_ITEM5_P11_S1	The statement of operations data, the statement of cash flows data and the other data for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 and the balance sheet data as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 were derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

1138118_17_ITEM5_P14_S0	(1) On September 1, 2015, CBRE, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, closed on a Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement with Johnson Controls, Inc. (JCI) to acquire JCI s Global Workplace Solutions (JCI-GWS) business (which we refer to as the GWS Acquisition).
1138118_17_ITEM5_P14_S1	The results for the year ended December 31, 2015 include the operations of JCI-GWS from September 1, 2015, the date such business was acquired.
1138118_17_ITEM5_P15_S0	(2) See Income Per Share information in Note 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_17_ITEM5_P16_S0	EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not recognized measurements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP.
1138118_17_ITEM5_P16_S1	When analyzing our operating performance, investors should use these measures in addition to, and not as an alternative for, their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
1138118_17_ITEM5_P16_S2	We generally use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes.
1138118_17_ITEM5_P16_S3	We believe these measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of current results to prior periods and may be useful for investors to analyze our financial performance because they eliminate the impact of selected charges that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of our business.
1138118_17_ITEM5_P16_S4	Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
1138118_17_ITEM5_P17_S0	EBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.
1138118_17_ITEM5_P17_S1	the impact of certain cash and non-cash charges related to acquisitions, cost-elimination expenses and certain carried interest incentive compensation (reversal) expense to align with the timing of associated revenue.
1138118_17_ITEM5_P17_S2	We believe that investors may find these measures useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because their calculations generally eliminate the effects of acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions, the effects of financings and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending.
1138118_17_ITEM5_P17_S3	EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for our discretionary use because they do not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.
1138118_17_ITEM5_P17_S4	These measures may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which amounts are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
1138118_17_ITEM5_P17_S5	We also use adjusted EBITDA as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive compensation programs.
1138118_17_ITEM5_P18_S0	EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_17_ITEM5_P19_S0	In the third quarter of 2015, we elected to early adopt the provisions of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-03, Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.
1138118_17_ITEM5_P19_S1	This ASU required that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability instead of separately being recorded in other assets.
1138118_17_ITEM5_P19_S2	As of December 31, 2014, deferred financing costs totaling $25.6 million were reclassified from other assets and netted against the related debt liabilities to conform with the 2015 presentation.
1138118_17_ITEM5_P19_S3	See Deferred Financing Costs discussion within Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_17_ITEM5_P19_S4	Amounts for 2012 and 2013 have not been reclassified to conform with the presentation in 2014, 2015 and 2016.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	We are the world s largest commercial real estate services and investment firm, based on 2016 revenue, with leading full-service operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P0_S1	We provide services in the office, retail, industrial, multifamily and hotel sectors of commercial real estate.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P0_S2	As of December 31, 2016, we operated in approximately 450 offices worldwide with more than 75,000 employees, excluding independent affiliates, providing commercial real estate services under the CBRE brand name, investment management services under the CBRE Global Investors brand name and development services under the Trammell Crow Company brand name.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P0_S3	Our business is focused on commercial property, corporate facilities, project and transaction management, tenant/occupier and property/agency leasing, capital markets solutions (property sales, commercial mortgage brokerage, loan origination and servicing) real estate investment management, valuation, development services and proprietary research.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P0_S4	We generate revenue from both management fees (large multi-year portfolio and per-project contracts) and from commissions on transactions.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P0_S5	We have been included in the Fortune 500 since 2008 (ranking #259 in 2016) and among the Fortune Most Admired Companies in the real estate sector for five consecutive years, including 2017.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P0_S6	In 2016, we were ranked by Forbes as the 15 th best employer in America, and the International Association of Outsourcing Professionals (IAOP) has ranked us among the top few outsourcing service providers across all industries for five consecutive years.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P0_S7	Additionally, we were one of only two companies to be ranked in the top 12 in the Barron s 500, which evaluates companies on growth and financial performance, in each of 2014, 2015 and 2016.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that we believe to be reasonable.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P1_S2	Actual results may differ from those estimates.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P1_S3	We believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P1_S4	In order for us to recognize revenue, four basic criteria must be met:
1138118_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our revenue recognition policies are consistent with these criteria.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	The judgments involved in revenue recognition include understanding the complex terms of agreements and determining the appropriate time and method to recognize revenue for each transaction based on such terms.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	Each transaction is evaluated to determine: (i) at what point in time or over what period of time revenue is earned; (ii) whether contingencies exist that impact the timing of recognition of revenue; and (iii) how and when such contingencies will be resolved.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P3_S2	The timing of revenue recognition could vary if different judgments were made.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P3_S3	Our revenues subject to the most judgment are brokerage commission revenue and incentive-based management and development fees.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P3_S4	For a detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policies, see the Revenue Recognition section within Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or this Annual Report.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	In establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables, we make assumptions with respect to future collectability.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	Our assumptions are based on an assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends, including the aging of receivables balances.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P4_S2	In addition to these assessments, in general, outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are more than 180 days overdue are evaluated for collectability and fully provided for if deemed uncollectible.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	Historically, our credit losses have generally been insignificant.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	However, estimating losses requires significant judgment, and conditions may change or new information may become known after any periodic evaluation.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P5_S2	As a result, actual credit losses may differ from our estimates.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting, which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	In determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, we use a variety of valuation methods including present value, depreciated replacement cost, market values (where available) and selling prices less costs to dispose.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	We are responsible for determining the valuation of assets and liabilities and for the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	Assumptions must often be made in determining fair values, particularly where observable market values do not exist.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P9_S1	Assumptions may include discount rates, growth rates, cost of capital, royalty rates, tax rates and remaining useful lives.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P9_S2	These assumptions can have a significant impact on the value of identifiable assets and accordingly can impact the value of goodwill recorded.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P9_S3	Different assumptions could result in different values being attributed to assets and liabilities.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P9_S4	Since these values impact the amount of annual depreciation and amortization expense, different assumptions could also impact our statement of operations and could impact the results of future asset impairment reviews.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	We are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	The goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step process.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	The first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	We use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P12_S2	Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P12_S3	These assumptions include revenue growth rates, profit margin percentages, discount rates, etc.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered to not be impaired.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	The second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one, over the estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P14_S2	Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business s fair value and the relative size of our goodwill, if different assumptions and estimates were used, it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P14_S3	For additional information on goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing, see Notes 2 and 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with the Accounting for Income Taxes , Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, (Topic 740).
1138118_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P16_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P16_S2	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	Accounting for tax positions requires judgments, including estimating reserves for potential uncertainties.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	We also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P18_S2	We do not record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that we believe will be realized in future periods.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P18_S3	While we believe the resulting tax balances as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with Topic 740, as applicable, the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P18_S4	Our foreign subsidiaries have accumulated $1.9 billion of undistributed earnings for which we have not recorded a deferred tax liability.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P18_S5	Although tax liabilities might result from dividends being paid out of these earnings, or as a result of a sale or liquidation of non-U.S. subsidiaries, these earnings are permanently reinvested outside of the United States and we do not have any plans to repatriate them or to sell or liquidate any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P18_S6	To the extent that we are able to repatriate earnings in a tax efficient manner, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds, net of foreign tax credits.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P18_S7	Determining our tax liability upon repatriation is not practicable.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P18_S8	Cash and cash equivalents owned by non-U.S. subsidiaries totaled $408.9 million at December 31, 2016.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P18_S9	See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information regarding income taxes.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P18_S10	New Accounting Pronouncements See New Accounting Pronouncements section within Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	Seasonality A significant portion of our revenue is seasonal, which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	Historically, our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flow from operating activities tend to be lowest in the first quarter, and highest in the fourth quarter of each year.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P20_S1	Revenue, earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales, financing and leasing transactions prior to year-end.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	Inflation Our commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by commercial real estate market supply and demand, which may be affected by inflation.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	However, to date, we do not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon our operations.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P21_S2	When you read our financial statements and the information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should consider that we have experienced, and continue to experience, several material trends and uncertainties that have affected our financial condition and results of operations that make it challenging to predict our future performance based on our historical results.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P21_S3	We believe that the following material trends and uncertainties are crucial to an understanding of the variability in our historical earnings and cash flows and the potential for continued variability in the future.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	Macroeconomic Conditions Economic trends and government policies affect global and regional commercial real estate markets as well as our operations directly.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	These include: overall economic activity and employment growth; interest rate levels and changes in interest rates; the cost and availability of credit; and the impact of tax and regulatory policies.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P22_S2	Periods of economic weakness or recession, significantly rising interest rates, fiscal uncertainty, declining employment levels, decreasing demand for commercial real estate, falling real estate values, disruption to the global capital or credit markets, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, will negatively affect the performance of our business.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P22_S3	Compensation is our largest expense and the sales and leasing professionals in our advisory services business generally are paid on a commission and/or bonus basis that correlates with their revenue production.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P22_S4	As a result, the negative effect of difficult market conditions on our operating margins is partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P22_S5	In addition, when negative economic conditions have been particularly severe, we have moved decisively to lower operating expenses to improve financial performance, and then have restored certain expenses as economic conditions improved.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P22_S6	Nevertheless, adverse global and regional economic trends could pose significant risks to the performance of our operations and our financial condition.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	Commercial real estate markets have recovered over the past several years, along with the steady improvement in global economic activity, most particularly in the United States.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P23_S1	Since 2010, U.S. leasing markets have been marked by increased demand for space, falling vacancies and higher rents.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P23_S2	During this time, healthy U.S. property sales activity has been sustained by gradually improving market fundamentals, low-cost credit availability and increased global and domestic capital flows.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P23_S3	Property sales volumes slowed in 2016 following several years of strong growth; however, the market remained active.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P23_S4	Commercial mortgage services activity rose in 2016 driven by lower interest rates and a favorable lending environment.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	Lending for multi-family properties in the United States was particularly robust, reflecting strong activity with U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) as well as a long-term trend of increased renting versus home ownership in the United States.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	European economies began to emerge from recession in 2013, with most countries returning to positive, albeit modest, economic growth.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	Sales and leasing activity in Europe has improved across most of Europe for much of the past two years.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P25_S2	An exception is London, where uncertainty in advance of and following the United Kingdom s referendum to leave the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit, constrained occupier and investor activity in 2016.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	In Asia Pacific, the performance of real estate leasing and investment markets has varied from country to country amid slowing economic growth.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	Leasing and investment market activity was generally soft for much of 2016, but picked up noticeably in the fourth quarter.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P26_S2	However, local capital from the Asia-Pacific region continues to migrate to other parts of the world.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	Real estate investment management and property development markets have been generally favorable with abundant debt and equity capital flows into commercial real estate.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	Real estate equity securities markets weakened in the fourth quarter of 2016 amid concerns about potentially higher interest rates.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	The performance of our global real estate services and real estate investment businesses depends on sustained economic growth and job creation; stable, healthy global credit markets; and continued positive business and investor sentiment.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	On September 1, 2015, CBRE, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, pursuant to a Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement with Johnson Controls, Inc. (JCI), acquired JCI s Global Workplace Solutions (JCI-GWS) business (which we refer to as the GWS Acquisition).
1138118_17_ITEM7_P29_S1	The acquired JCI-GWS business was a market-leading provider of integrated facilities management solutions for major occupiers of commercial real estate and had significant operations around the world.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P29_S2	The purchase price was $1.475 billion, paid in cash, plus adjustments totaling $46.5 million for working capital and other items.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P29_S3	We completed the GWS Acquisition in order to advance our strategy of delivering globally integrated services to major occupiers in our Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific segments.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P29_S4	We merged the acquired JCI-GWS business with our existing occupier outsourcing business line, and the new combined business adopted the Global Workplace Solutions name.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P29_S5	Strategic in-fill acquisitions have also played a key role in expanding our geographic coverage and broadening and strengthening our service offerings.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P29_S6	The companies we acquired have generally been regional or specialty firms that complement our existing platform, or independent affiliates in which, in some cases, we held a small equity interest.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P29_S7	In early 2017, we acquired a leading Software as a Service (SaaS) platform that produces scalable interactive visualization technologies for commercial real estate and a national boutique commercial real estate finance and consulting firm in the United States.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P29_S8	During 2016, we acquired our independent affiliate in Norway, a London-based retail property advisor specializing in the luxury goods retail sector and a leading provider of retail project management, shopping center development and tenant coordination services in the United States.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P29_S9	We also made an equity investment in a property services firm in Malaysia, acquiring a 49% interest.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P29_S10	During 2015, we completed eight in-fill acquisitions, including a Seattle-based leader in capital markets services for affordable housing, a Texas-based commercial real estate firm specializing in retail services, an energy management specialist based in Brookfield, Wisconsin, a Chicago-based location data analytics firm, one of the leading retail real estate services firms in the Midwestern United States, an advisory, consulting and research firm specializing in the Canadian hospitality and tourism industries and our former independent affiliate companies in Columbia, South Carolina, and Memphis, Tennessee.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P29_S11	We believe that strategic acquisitions can significantly decrease the cost, time and commitment of management resources necessary to attain a meaningful competitive position within targeted markets or to expand our presence within our current markets.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P29_S12	In general, however, most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating and net income as a result of transaction-related expenditures.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P29_S13	These include severance, lease termination, transaction and deferred financing costs, among others, and the charges and costs of integrating the acquired business and its financial and accounting systems into our own.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P29_S14	Our acquisition structures often include deferred and/or contingent purchase price payments in future periods that are subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P29_S15	As of December 31, 2016, we have accrued deferred consideration totaling $91.0 million, which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P29_S16	We are monitoring the economic and political developments related to Brexit and the potential impact on our businesses in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe, including, in particular, sales and leasing activity in the United Kingdom, as well as any associated currency volatility impact on our results of operations.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P29_S17	As we continue to increase our international operations through either acquisitions or organic growth, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	Our Global Investment Management business has a significant amount of euro-denominated assets under management, or AUM, as well as associated revenue and earnings in Europe.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have resulted and may continue to result in corresponding fluctuations in our AUM, revenue and earnings.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P31_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 47% of our business was transacted in non-U.S. dollar currencies, the majority of which included the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Danish krone, euro, Hong Kong dollar, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Polish zloty, Singapore dollar, Swedish krona, Swiss franc and Thai baht.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P31_S2	The following table sets forth our revenue derived from our most significant currencies (U.S. dollars in thousands):
1138118_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	Although we operate globally, we report our results in U.S. dollars.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	As a result, the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar may positively or negatively impact our reported results.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P32_S2	For example, we estimate that had the British pound sterling-to-U.S. dollar exchange rates been 10% higher during the year ended December 31, 2016, the net impact would have been an increase in pre-tax income of $4.9 million.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P32_S3	Had the euro-to-U.S. dollar exchange rates been 10% higher during the year ended December 31, 2016, the net impact would have been an increase in pre-tax income of $3.7 million.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P32_S4	These hypothetical calculations estimate the impact of translating results into U.S. dollars and do not include an estimate of the impact that a 10% change in the U.S. dollar against other currencies would have had on our foreign operations.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	We enter into derivative financial instruments to attempt to protect the value or fix the amount of certain obligations in terms of our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	In March 2014, we began a foreign currency exchange forward hedging program (which expired in December 2016) by entering into foreign currency exchange forward contracts, including agreements to buy U.S. dollars and sell Australian dollars, British pound sterling, Canadian dollars, euros and Japanese yen.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P33_S2	The purpose of these forward contracts was to attempt to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that would adversely impact some of our foreign currency denominated EBITDA.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P33_S3	Hedge accounting was not elected for any of these contracts.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P33_S4	As such, changes in the fair values of these contracts were recorded directly in earnings.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P33_S5	Included in the consolidated statement of operations set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report were net gains of $7.7 million , $24.2 million and $5.3 million from foreign currency exchange forward contracts for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P33_S6	As of December 31, 2016, we had no foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding as the program has been terminated.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P33_S7	We do not intend to hedge our foreign currency denominated EBITDA in 2017.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	Due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P34_S2	Our international operations also are subject to, among other things, political instability and changing regulatory environments, which affects the currency markets and which as a result may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P34_S3	We routinely monitor these risks and related costs and evaluate the appropriate amount of oversight to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	The following table sets forth items derived from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands): Fee revenue, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not recognized measurements under GAAP.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	When analyzing our operating performance, investors should use these measures in addition to, and not as an alternative for, their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	generally use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P36_S1	We believe these measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of current results to prior periods and may be useful for investors to analyze our financial performance because they eliminate the impact of selected charges that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of our business.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P36_S2	Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of fee revenue, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	Fee revenue is gross revenue less both client reimbursed costs largely associated with employees that are dedicated to client facilities and subcontracted vendor work performed for clients.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P37_S1	We believe that investors may find this measure useful to analyze the company s overall financial performance because it excludes costs reimbursable by clients, and as such provides greater visibility into the underlying performance of our business.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	EBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P38_S1	the impact of certain cash and non-cash charges related to acquisitions, cost-elimination expenses and certain carried interest incentive compensation (reversal) expense to align with the timing of associated revenue.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P38_S2	We believe that investors may find these measures useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because their calculations generally eliminate the effects of acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions, the effects of financings and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P38_S3	EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for our discretionary use because they do not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P38_S4	These measures may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which amounts are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P38_S5	We also use adjusted EBITDA as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive compensation programs.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	cost structure after several years of significant revenue and related cost growth.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	Cost-elimination expenses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of $73.6 million of severance costs related to headcount reductions in connection with the program and $4.9 million of third-party contract termination costs.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P40_S2	Cost-elimination expenses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of $32.6 million of severance costs related to headcount reductions in connection with the program and $7.8 million of third-party contract termination costs.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P40_S3	The total amount for each period does have a cash impact.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015 We reported consolidated net income of $572.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 on revenue of $13.1 billion as compared to consolidated net income of $547.1 million on revenue of $10.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	Our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $2.2 billion, or 20.4%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P41_S2	This increase was largely due to contributions from the GWS Acquisition, which added $1.8 billion of revenue, with a full year of activity reflected in the current year versus only four months of activity in 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P41_S3	Additionally, the revenue increase reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher occupier outsourcing revenue (excluding the impact of the GWS Acquisition, up 14.0%), as well as increased leasing (up 6.7%), commercial mortgage brokerage (up 19.1%) and sales (up 1.4%) activity.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P41_S4	These increases were partially offset by lower carried interest revenue in the current year as well as foreign currency translation, which had a $277.8 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016 versus the same period in 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the British pound sterling.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P41_S5	Our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by $2.0 billion, or 28.8%, during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to same period in 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P41_S6	This increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our occupier outsourcing business, particularly due to the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P41_S7	In addition, our sales professionals generally are paid on a commission basis, which substantially correlates with our transaction revenue performance.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P41_S8	Accordingly, the increase in sales and lease transaction revenue led to a corresponding increase in commission expense.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P41_S9	We also incurred $18.9 million of additional costs in 2016 versus 2015 in connection with our cost-elimination project that began in the fourth quarter of 2015 and ended in the third quarter of 2016 to enhance margins and reduce our global cost structure going forward (the expenses of which primarily consisted of severance costs related to headcount reductions and third-party contract termination costs).
1138118_17_ITEM7_P41_S10	These increases were partially offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $205.5 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P41_S11	Cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased from 65.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 69.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016, largely due to the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P41_S12	Excluding activity associated with the acquired JCI-GWS business, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 62.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 64.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P41_S13	This increase was partly driven by the aforementioned increase in costs incurred in connection with our cost-elimination project in 2016 and lower non-commissionable revenue in the current year.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P41_S14	In addition, outsourcing revenue (excluding the impact of the GWS Acquisition), which has a lower margin than sales and lease transaction revenue, was a lower percentage of revenue in 2015 than in 2016.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P41_S15	Our operating, administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis increased by $147.7 million, or 5.6%, during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P41_S16	The increase was mostly driven by costs associated with the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P41_S17	Also contributing to the variance were higher worldwide payroll-related costs (particularly bonuses largely attributable to improved results, most notably in our Development Services segment).
1138118_17_ITEM7_P41_S18	Lastly, we incurred an additional $19.1 million of costs in 2016 versus 2015 in connection with our cost-elimination project.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P41_S19	These items were partly offset by lower carried interest expense as well as foreign currency, which had a net $46.2 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016, including $10.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency transaction activity over the same period last year, much of which related to hedging activities, that was more than offset by a $57.1 million positive impact from foreign currency translation.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	decreased from 24.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 21.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P42_S1	Excluding activity associated with the acquired JCI-GWS business, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was 25.7% for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 24.7% for the same period in 2016, partly driven by the lower carried interest expense in the current year.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P42_S2	Our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by $52.8 million, or 16.8%, during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P42_S3	This increase was primarily attributable to higher amortization expense related to intangibles acquired in the GWS Acquisition, with a full year of amortization reflected in the current year versus only four months of amortization in 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P42_S4	A rise in depreciation expense during the year ended December 31, 2016 driven by technology-related capital expenditures also contributed to the increase.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P42_S5	Our equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis increased by $34.5 million, or 21.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily driven by higher equity earnings associated with gains on property sales reported in our Development Services segment.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P42_S6	Our consolidated interest expense increased by $26.0 million, or 21.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P42_S7	This increase was primarily driven by interest expense in the current year associated with $600.0 million of 4.875% senior notes issued in August 2015 as well as higher interest expense associated with borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement dated January 9, 2015 (2015 Credit Agreement) due to an increase in interest rates.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P42_S8	Our write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt on a consolidated basis was $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P42_S9	These costs included the write-off of $1.7 million of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with our prior credit agreement dated March 28, 2013, as amended (2013 Credit Agreement), and $1.0 million of fees incurred in connection with our 2015 Credit Agreement.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P42_S10	Our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was $296.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $320.9 million for the same period in 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P42_S11	Our effective tax rate, after adjusting pre-tax income to remove the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, decreased to 34.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 37.0% for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P42_S12	We experienced a favorable change in earnings mix in the current year, with 60% of our earnings, after removing the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, from the United States for 2016 versus 68% for 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P42_S13	In addition, we realized certain discrete tax benefits in the current year that were not applicable in 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P42_S14	These items were offset, in part, by higher losses sustained in the current year in jurisdictions where no tax benefit could be provided.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014 We reported consolidated net income of $547.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 on revenue of $10.9 billion as compared to consolidated net income of $484.5 million on revenue of $9.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	Our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $1.8 billion, or 20.0%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P43_S2	This increase was in part due to contributions from the GWS Acquisition from September 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P43_S3	Additionally, the revenue increase also reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher occupier outsourcing revenue (excluding the impact of the GWS Acquisition, up 15.4%) and property management fees (up 17.5%), as well as increased sales (up 17.9%) and leasing (up 11.5%) activity.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P43_S4	An increase in global appraisal revenue (up 18.6%) and commercial mortgage brokerage activity in our Americas segment (up 28.5%) also contributed to the positive variance.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	Foreign currency translation had a $536.4 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, euro and Japanese yen during the year ended December 31, 2015 versus the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	Our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by $1.5 billion, or 26.2%, during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	This increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our occupier outsourcing and property management businesses, particularly due to the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P45_S2	In addition, as previously mentioned, our sales professionals generally are paid on a commission basis, which substantially correlates with our transaction revenue performance.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P45_S3	Accordingly, the increase in sales and lease transaction revenue led to a corresponding increase in commission expense.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P45_S4	Lastly, we incurred $18.3 million of costs in connection with our cost-elimination project.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P45_S5	These increases were partially offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $318.4 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P45_S6	Cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased from 62.0% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 65.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015, largely due to the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P45_S7	Excluding activity associated with the acquired JCI-GWS business, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 62.0% for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 62.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P45_S8	Our operating, administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis increased by $194.6 million, or 8.0%, during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P45_S9	The increase was partly driven by costs associated with the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P45_S10	Also contributing to the variance were higher worldwide payroll-related costs (including bonuses) attributable to increased headcount and improved results as well as higher consulting, marketing and travel costs.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P45_S11	Lastly, we incurred $22.1 million of costs in connection with our cost-elimination project.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P45_S12	These increases were partially mitigated by an $8.6 million asset impairment charge incurred in our Americas segment during the year ended December 31, 2014, which did not recur during the year ended December 31, 2015, and foreign currency movement.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P45_S13	Foreign currency translation had a $162.3 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 and there was an improvement of $20.7 million in foreign currency transaction activity over the year ended December 31, 2014, much of which related to hedging activities.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P45_S14	Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 27.0% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 24.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015, partially due to the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P45_S15	Excluding activity associated with the acquired JCI-GWS business, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was 27.0% for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 25.7% for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P45_S16	Our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by $49.0 million, or 18.5%, during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P45_S17	This increase was primarily attributable to higher amortization expense relative to intangibles acquired in the GWS Acquisition as well as increased amortization expense associated with mortgage servicing rights.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P45_S18	A rise in depreciation expense during the year ended December 31, 2015 driven by technology-related capital expenditures also contributed to the increase.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P45_S19	Our gain on disposition of real estate on a consolidated basis was $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $57.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P45_S20	These gains resulted from activity within our Global Investment Management and Development Services segments.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P45_S21	Our equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis increased by $61.1 million, or 60.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily driven by higher equity earnings associated with gains on property sales reported in our Development Services segment.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P45_S22	Our consolidated interest expense increased by $6.8 million, or 6.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P45_S23	This increase was primarily driven by higher interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2015 associated with $600.0 million of 4.875% senior notes issued in August 2015 as well as the 5.25% senior notes issued in September 2014 and December 2014 of $300.0 million and $125.0 million, respectively.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P45_S24	These increases were partially offset by lower interest expense associated with $350.0 million of 6.625% senior notes, which were redeemed in full in October 2014, as well as lower interest expense due to a decrease in notes payable on real estate during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	Our write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt on a consolidated basis was $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	The costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015 included the write-off of $1.7 million of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with our 2013 Credit Agreement, and $1.0 million of fees incurred in connection with our 2015 Credit Agreement.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P46_S2	The costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily related to costs associated with the redemption in full of our 6.625% senior notes, including a $17.4 million early extinguishment premium and the write-off of $5.7 million of previously deferred financing costs.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P46_S3	See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on such credit agreements.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	Our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was $320.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $263.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	This increase was driven by the significant growth in pre-tax income during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P47_S2	Our effective tax rate, after adjusting pre-tax income to remove the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, increased to 37.0% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 35.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P47_S3	This increase was largely due to the reversal of accrued taxes, interest and penalties related to settled positions, which had a favorable impact on the 2014 effective tax rate and did not recur in 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	We report our operations through the following segments: (1) Americas, (2) EMEA, (3) Asia Pacific, (4) Global Investment Management, and (5) Development Services.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	The Americas consists of operations located in the United States, Canada and key markets in Latin America.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P49_S1	EMEA mainly consists of operations in Europe, while Asia Pacific includes operations in Asia, Australia and New Zealand.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P49_S2	The Global Investment Management business consists of investment management operations in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P49_S3	The Development Services business consists of real estate development and investment activities primarily in the United States.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	The following table summarizes our results of operations by our Americas, EMEA, Asia Pacific, Global Investment Management and Development Services operating segments for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):
1138118_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	(1) During 2016, we changed our methodology for allocating certain costs to our reporting segments, including stock compensation, currency hedging and certain intercompany transactions.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P51_S1	Prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P51_S2	Such changes had no impact on our consolidated results.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015 Americas Revenue increased by $1.0 billion, or 16.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P52_S1	This increase was in part due to contributions from the GWS Acquisition, which added $641.6 million of revenue, with a full year of activity reflected in the current year versus only four months of activity in 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P52_S2	Additionally, the revenue increase reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher occupier outsourcing revenue (excluding the impact of the GWS Acquisition, up 10.4%), as well as improved leasing and commercial mortgage brokerage activity.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	Foreign currency translation had a $30.6 million negative impact on revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016 versus the same period in 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P53_S1	Cost of services increased by $918.2 million, or 22.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to higher costs associated with our occupier outsourcing business, particularly due to the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P53_S2	Also contributing to the variance was higher commission expense resulting from improved lease transaction revenue.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P53_S3	We also incurred $10.3 million of additional costs in 2016 versus 2015 in connection with our cost-elimination project.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P53_S4	Foreign currency translation had a $21.8 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P53_S5	Cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased to 69.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 66.5% for the same period in 2015, largely due to the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P53_S6	Excluding activity associated with the acquired JCI-GWS business, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 66.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 65.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015, partly driven by the aforementioned costs associated with our cost-elimination project.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P53_S7	Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $78.9 million, or 6.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P53_S8	The increase was partly driven by costs associated with the GWS Acquisition as well as higher payroll-related costs, including an increase in 401(k) contributions in the United States.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P53_S9	Higher software license and maintenance contract costs also contributed to the increase.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P53_S10	Foreign currency had a net $4.5 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016, which included a positive impact from foreign currency translation of $6.2 million, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency transaction activity, mostly hedging related, of $1.7 million.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	In connection with the origination and sale of mortgage loans for which the company retains servicing rights, we record servicing assets or liabilities based on the fair value of the retained mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) on the date the loans are sold.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P54_S1	We also assume or purchase certain servicing assets.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	Gains from mortgage servicing rights are initially recorded at fair value within revenue.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	Subsequent to the initial recording, MSRs are amortized (within amortization expense) and carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value in other intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P55_S2	They are amortized in proportion to and over the estimated period that the servicing income is expected to be received.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P55_S3	In any given period, the net of gains from MSRs less related amortization equals the net non-cash impact to operating income from such activity (Net MSRs).
1138118_17_ITEM7_P55_S4	For the year ended December 31, 2016, Net MSRs increased $29.6 million over the same period in the prior year.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P55_S5	For the year ended December 31, 2016, Net MSRs contributed $80.7 million to operating income, consisting of $154.0 million of gains recognized in conjunction with the origination and sale of mortgage loans, offset by $73.3 million of amortization of related intangible assets.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P55_S6	For the year ended December 31, 2015, Net MSRs contributed $51.1 million to operating income, consisting of $110.4 million of gains recognized in conjunction with the origination and sale of mortgage loans, offset by $59.3 million of amortization of related intangible assets.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P55_S7	EMEA Revenue increased by $913.5 million, or 30.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	added $924.9 million of revenue, with a full year of activity reflected in the current year versus only four months of activity in 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P56_S1	In addition, the revenue increase also reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher occupier outsourcing revenue (excluding the impact of the GWS Acquisition, up 15.8%).
1138118_17_ITEM7_P56_S2	Leasing activity was up slightly and sales activity was flat versus the prior year.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	Foreign currency translation had a $232.6 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016 versus the same period in 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the British pound sterling.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P57_S1	Cost of services increased by $821.8 million, or 37.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P57_S2	This increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our occupier outsourcing business, particularly due to the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P57_S3	We also incurred $9.3 million of additional costs in 2016 versus 2015 in connection with our cost-elimination project.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P57_S4	These increases were partially reduced by foreign currency translation, which had a $177.8 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P57_S5	Cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased to 77.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 73.4% for the year ended December 31, 2015, largely due to the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P57_S6	Excluding activity associated with the acquired JCI-GWS business, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 69.0% for both the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P57_S7	Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $73.6 million, or 11.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily driven by higher costs associated with the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P57_S8	Higher payroll-related costs (including bonuses) in the current year also contributed to the variance.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P57_S9	These increases were partially mitigated by foreign currency, which had a $44.2 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016, including $1.0 million in favorable foreign currency transaction activity over the same period last year, much of which related to hedging activities, and a $43.2 million positive impact from foreign currency translation.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	Asia Pacific Revenue increased by $350.9 million, or 30.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P58_S1	This increase was largely due to contributions from the GWS Acquisition, which added $229.4 million of revenue, with a full year of activity reflected in the current year versus only four months of activity in 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P58_S2	The revenue increase also reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher occupier outsourcing revenue (excluding the impact of the GWS Acquisition, up 33.4%) as well as improved sales and leasing activity.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P58_S3	This increase was partially offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $2.8 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016 versus the same period in 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the Chinese yuan and Indian rupee, largely mitigated by strength in the Japanese yen.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P58_S4	Cost of services increased by $300.8 million, or 39.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, driven by higher costs associated with our occupier outsourcing businesses, including the acquired GWS business.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P58_S5	This was partially offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $5.9 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P58_S6	Cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased to 71.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 67.1% for the same period in 2015, primarily due to the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P58_S7	Excluding activity associated with the acquired JCI-GWS business, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 65.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 64.1% for the same period in 2015, primarily driven by our revenue mix, with outsourcing revenue, which has a lower margin than sales and lease revenue, being a higher percentage of revenue than in the prior year.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P58_S8	Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $24.4 million, or 8.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, mainly driven by costs associated with the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P58_S9	Additionally, foreign currency activity had an overall negative impact of $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, due to unfavorable foreign currency transaction activity, mostly related to hedging.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	Global Investment Management Revenue decreased by $90.9 million, or 19.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P59_S1	This decrease was primarily driven by lower carried interest revenue as well as lower acquisition, asset management and incentive fees in the current year.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	Foreign currency translation had an $11.8 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016 versus the same period in 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the British pound sterling.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P60_S1	Operating, administrative and other expenses decreased by $50.8 million, or 14.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily driven by lower carried interest expense incurred in the current year.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P60_S2	Additionally, foreign currency had a net $5.0 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016, which included $2.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency transaction activity over the same period last year, much of which related to hedging activities, that was more than offset by a $7.7 million positive impact from foreign currency translation.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P60_S3	These decreases were partially offset by $19.8 million of additional costs in 2016 versus 2015 in connection with our cost-elimination project.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	A roll forward of our AUM by product type for the year ended December 31, 2016 is as follows (dollars in billions): AUM generally refers to the properties and other assets with respect to which we provide (or participate in) oversight, investment management services and other advice, and which generally consist of real estate properties or loans, securities portfolios and investments in operating companies and joint ventures.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P61_S1	Our AUM is intended principally to reflect the extent of our presence in the real estate market, not the basis for determining our management fees.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P61_S2	Our assets under management consist of:
1138118_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	the total fair market value of the real estate properties and other assets either wholly-owned or held by joint ventures and other entities in which our sponsored funds or investment vehicles and client accounts have invested or to which they have provided financing.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P62_S1	Committed (but unfunded) capital from investors in our sponsored funds is not included in this component of our AUM.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P62_S2	The value of development properties is included at estimated completion cost.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	the net asset value of our managed securities portfolios, including investments (which may be comprised of committed but uncalled capital) in private real estate funds under our fund of funds program.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P63_S1	Our calculation of AUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	Development Services Revenue increased by $5.8 million, or 8.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily driven by higher development fees in the current year.

1138118_17_ITEM7_P65_S1	This increase was primarily driven by higher bonuses in the current year as a result of significantly improved operating performance due to property sales (reflected in equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries and gain on disposition of real estate).
1138118_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	As of December 31, 2016, development projects in process totaled $6.6 billion, down $100 million from year-end 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P66_S1	The new projects pipeline totaled $4.2 billion, up $600 million from a year ago.

1138118_17_ITEM7_P67_S1	This increase was in part due to contributions from the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P67_S2	Additionally, the revenue increase also reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher occupier outsourcing revenue (excluding the impact of the GWS Acquisition, up 10.8%) and property management fees (up 14.7%), as well as improved sales, leasing, commercial mortgage brokerage and appraisal activity.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	Foreign currency translation had an $85.6 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the Brazilian real and Canadian dollar when converting to U.S. dollars during the year ended December 31, 2015 versus the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P68_S1	Cost of services increased by $717.8 million, or 21.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to higher costs associated with our property management and occupier outsourcing businesses, particularly due to the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P68_S2	This increase was also due to higher commission expense resulting from improved sales and lease transaction revenue.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P68_S3	Additionally, higher salaries and related costs due to increased headcount (in part due to in-fill acquisitions) also contributed to the increase.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P68_S4	Foreign currency translation had a $52.8 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P68_S5	Cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased to 66.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 65.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014, largely due to the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P68_S6	Excluding activity associated with the acquired JCI-GWS business, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 65.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 65.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P68_S7	Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $155.8 million, or 13.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P68_S8	The increase was partly driven by costs associated with the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P68_S9	Also contributing to the variance were higher payroll-related costs (including bonuses) attributable to increased headcount and improved results as well as higher consulting, marketing and travel costs.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P68_S10	These increases were partially mitigated by an $8.6 million asset impairment charge incurred in our Americas segment during the year ended December 31, 2014, which did not recur during the year ended December 31, 2015, and foreign currency movement.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P68_S11	Foreign currency translation had a $24.5 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 and there was an improvement of $19.1 million in foreign currency transaction activity over the year ended December 31, 2014, some of which related to hedging activities.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P68_S12	For the year ended December 31, 2015, Net MSRs increased $26.1 million over the same period in 2014.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P68_S13	For the year ended December 31, 2015, Net MSRs contributed $51.1 million to operating income, consisting of $110.4 million of gains recognized in conjunction with the origination and sale of mortgage loans, offset by $59.3 million of amortization of related intangible assets.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P68_S14	For the year ended December 31, 2014, Net MSRs contributed $25.0 million to operating income, consisting of $73.9 million of gains recognized in conjunction with the origination and sale of mortgage loans, offset by $48.9 million of amortization of related intangible assets.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	EMEA Revenue increased by $660.2 million, or 28.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P69_S1	This increase was largely due to contributions from the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P69_S2	In addition, the revenue increase also reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher occupier outsourcing revenue (excluding the impact of the GWS Acquisition up 19.4%) and property management fees (up 25.9%), as well as improved sales, leasing and appraisal activity.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P69_S3	The increase in revenue was partially offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $291.6 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the British pound sterling and euro when converting to U.S. dollars during the year ended December 31, 2015 versus the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P69_S4	Cost of services increased by $599.7 million, or 37.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P69_S5	This increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our property management and occupier outsourcing businesses, particularly due to the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P69_S6	Additionally, we incurred $9.7 million of costs in connection with our cost-elimination project.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P69_S7	These increases were partially reduced by foreign currency translation, which had a $192.9 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P69_S8	Cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased to 73.4% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 68.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014, largely due to the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P69_S9	Excluding activity associated with the acquired JCI-GWS business, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 69.0% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 68.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P69_S10	Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $40.2 million, or 7.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily driven by higher payroll-related costs (including bonuses) during the year ended December 31, 2015 as well as costs associated with the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P69_S11	Additionally, we incurred $10.3 million of costs in connection with our cost-elimination project.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P69_S12	These items were partially offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $78.2 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	Asia Pacific Revenue increased by $167.3 million, or 17.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P70_S1	Contributions from the GWS Acquisition during the year ended December 31, 2015 as well as our acquisition of our former affiliate in Thailand in June 2014 drove the increase for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P70_S2	The revenue increase also reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher occupier outsourcing revenue (excluding the impact of the GWS Acquisition, up 30.1%) and property management fees (up 21.3%), as well as improved sales, leasing and appraisal activity.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P70_S3	The overall increase was largely muted by foreign currency translation, which had a $120.7 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the Australian dollar and Japanese yen when converting to U.S. dollars during the year ended December 31, 2015 versus the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P70_S4	Cost of services increased by $154.2 million, or 25.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, driven by higher costs associated with our property management and occupier outsourcing businesses, including the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P70_S5	Also contributing to the variance was increased commission expense resulting from higher transaction revenue as well as $7.0 million of costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015 in connection with our cost-elimination project.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P70_S6	These increases were partially offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $72.7 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended December 31, 2015.

1138118_17_ITEM7_P70_S8	Excluding activity associated with the acquired JCI-GWS business, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 64.1% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 62.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily driven by our revenue mix, with outsourcing revenue, which has a lower margin, being a higher percentage of revenue than in the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $8.6 million, or 3.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily driven by higher payroll-related costs (including bonuses) as well as $4.4 million of costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015 in connection with our cost-elimination project.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P71_S1	The increase was also partly driven by costs associated with the GWS Acquisition.

1138118_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	Global Investment Management Revenue decreased by $8.2 million, or 1.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily driven by foreign currency translation, which had a $38.5 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the British pound sterling and euro when converting to U.S. dollars during the year ended December 31, 2015 versus the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P72_S1	Higher carried interest revenue was more than offset by lower asset management, disposition and acquisition fees during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P72_S2	Operating, administrative and other expenses decreased by $27.0 million, or 7.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily driven by foreign currency translation, which had a $26.3 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P73_S0	A rollforward of our AUM by product type for the year ended December 31, 2015 is as follows (dollars in billions): We describe above how we calculate AUM.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P73_S1	Also as noted above, our calculation of AUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P74_S0	Development Services Revenue was relatively consistent at $65.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $65.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P74_S1	Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $17.1 million, or 17.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P74_S2	This increase was primarily driven by higher bonuses during the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of significantly improved operating performance due to property sales.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	As of December 31, 2015, development projects in process totaled $6.7 billion, up $1.3 billion from the end of 2014, and the inventory of pipeline deals totaled $3.6 billion, down $0.4 billion from year-end 2014.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that we can satisfy our working capital and funding requirements with internally generated cash flow and, as necessary, borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P77_S0	2017 include up to approximately $170 million of anticipated capital expenditures, net of tenant concessions.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P77_S1	As of December 31, 2016, we had aggregate commitments of $31.6 million to fund future co-investments in our Global Investment Management business, $25.5 million of which is expected to be funded in 2017.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P77_S2	Additionally, as of December 31, 2016, we are committed to fund $23.0 million of additional capital to unconsolidated subsidiaries within our Development Services business, which we may be required to fund at any time.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P77_S3	As of December 31, 2016, we had $2.8 billion of borrowings available under our $2.8 billion revolving credit facility.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P77_S4	We have historically relied on our internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital, capital expenditure and general investment requirements (including strategic in-fill acquisitions) and have not sought other external sources of financing to help fund these requirements.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P77_S5	In the absence of extraordinary events or a large strategic acquisition, we anticipate that our cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future, and at a minimum for the next 12 months.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P77_S6	We may seek to take advantage of market opportunities to refinance existing debt instruments, as we have done in the past, with new debt instruments at interest rates, maturities and terms we deem attractive.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P78_S0	As noted above, we believe that any future significant acquisitions that we may make could require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P78_S1	In the past, we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that we believed to be reasonable.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P78_S2	However, it is possible that we may not be able to obtain acquisition financing on favorable terms, or at all, in the future if we decide to make any further significant acquisitions.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	Our long-term liquidity needs, other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases, are generally comprised of two elements.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	The first is the repayment of the outstanding and anticipated principal amounts of our long-term indebtedness.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P80_S1	We are unable to project with certainty whether our long-term cash flow from operations will be sufficient to repay our long-term debt when it comes due.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P80_S2	If our cash flow is insufficient, then we expect that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P80_S3	We cannot make any assurances that such refinancing or amendments would be available on attractive terms, if at all.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	The second long-term liquidity need is the payment of obligations related to acquisitions.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P81_S1	Our acquisition structures often include deferred and/or contingent purchase price payments in future periods that are subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P81_S2	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had accrued $91.0 million and $79.7 million, respectively, of deferred purchase consideration, which was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P81_S3	In addition, on October 27, 2016, we announced that our board of directors had authorized the company to repurchase up to an aggregate of $250 million of its shares of Class A common stock over three years.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P81_S4	The timing of the repurchase and the actual amount repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of the company s common stock, general market and economic conditions and other factors.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P81_S5	We intend to fund the repurchases, if any, with cash on hand or borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P81_S6	Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $450.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $201.6 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P81_S7	The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher net payments to vendors and income taxes paid during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P81_S8	These items were partially offset by higher commissions paid during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $651.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $9.9 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P82_S1	The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher bonuses and commissions paid during the year ended December 31, 2015 as well as an increase in real estate held for development during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P82_S2	These items were partially offset by lower net payments to vendors and lower income taxes paid during the year ended December 31, 2015 as well as improved collections of receivables and operating performance during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P82_S3	Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $1.6 billion as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P82_S4	This variance was primarily driven by a greater amount invested in acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2015, particularly the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P82_S5	Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $1.5 billion as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P82_S6	This variance was primarily driven by amounts paid for the acquisition of the Global Workplace Solutions business during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P82_S7	Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $199.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $789.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P82_S8	This variance was primarily due to proceeds received from the issuance of $600.0 million of 4.875% senior notes in August 2015 as well as $378.8 million of higher net borrowings of term loans under our 2015 Credit Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P82_S9	These collective borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2015, as well as cash on hand, were used to fund the GWS Acquisition, which closed on September 1, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P82_S10	Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $789.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $232.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P82_S11	This variance was primarily due to proceeds received from the issuance of $600.0 million of 4.875% senior notes in August 2015 and lower net repayments under our revolving credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P82_S12	Also contributing to the increase was the establishment of $900.0 million of new senior term loan facilities under our 2015 Credit Agreement, partially offset by repayment of $645.6 million of senior term loans under our 2013 Credit Agreement, both of which occurred during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P82_S13	The net proceeds from the issuance of 5.25% senior notes and the redemption of $350.0 million of 6.625% senior notes during the year ended December 31, 2014 partially reduced the overall cash used in financing activities during 2014.

1138118_17_ITEM7_P92_S2	Accordingly, the entire balance has been reflected as expiring in less than one year.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P93_S0	Indebtedness Our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to pay the principal amount of our indebtedness and other obligations when due.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P93_S1	In addition, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or for other purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P93_S2	If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our debt, would increase.

1138118_17_ITEM7_P103_S1	The purpose of these interest rate swap agreements is to attempt to hedge potential changes to our cash flows due to the variable interest nature of our senior term loan facilities.
1138118_17_ITEM7_P103_S2	The total notional amount of these interest rate swap agreements is $400.0 million, with $200.0 million expiring in October 2017 and $200.0 million expiring in September 2019.

1138118_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations and changes in interest rates on debt obligations.
1138118_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We manage such risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of our debt funding and by using derivative financial instruments.
1138118_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We apply the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) (Topic 815) when accounting for derivative financial instruments.
1138118_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	In all cases, we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and, accordingly, do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
1138118_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Exchange Rates Our foreign operations expose us to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
1138118_17_ITEM7A_P2_S1	These fluctuations may impact the value of our cash receipts and payments in terms of our functional (reporting) currency, which is U.S. dollars.

1138118_17_ITEM7A_P4_S1	Based on dealers quotes, the estimated fair values of our 5.00% senior notes, 4.875% senior notes and 5.25% senior notes were $827.6 million, $607.0 million and $439.3 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016.
1138118_17_ITEM7A_P5_S0	We utilize sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect on our variable rate debt.
1138118_17_ITEM7A_P5_S1	If interest rates were to increase 100 basis points on our outstanding variable rate debt at December 31, 2016, excluding notes payable on real estate, the net impact of the additional interest cost would be a decrease of $3.5 million on pre-tax income and a decrease of $3.5 million in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	All other schedules are omitted because they are either not applicable, not required or the information required is included in the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes thereto.

1138118_17_ITEM8_P1_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1138118_17_ITEM8_P1_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P1_S7	Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

1138118_17_ITEM8_P1_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P1_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P2_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P2_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P2_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P2_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1138118_17_ITEM8_P10_S3	We provide services in the office, retail, industrial, multifamily and hotel sectors of commercial real estate.

1138118_17_ITEM8_P10_S6	We generate revenue from both management fees (large multi-year portfolio and per-project contracts) and from commissions on transactions.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P11_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our consolidated subsidiaries, which are comprised of variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary and voting interest entities, in which we determined we have a controlling financial interest, under the Consolidations Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) (Topic 810).
1138118_17_ITEM8_P11_S1	The equity attributable to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries is shown separately in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P11_S2	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P12_S0	We determine whether an entity is a VIE and, if so, whether it should be consolidated by utilizing judgments and estimates that are inherently subjective.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P12_S1	Our determination of whether an entity in which we hold a direct or indirect variable interest is a VIE is based on several factors, including whether the entity s total equity investment at risk upon inception is sufficient to finance the entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P12_S2	We make judgments regarding the sufficiency of the equity at risk based first on a qualitative analysis, and then a quantitative analysis, if necessary.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P13_S0	We analyze any investments in VIEs to determine if we are the primary beneficiary.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P13_S1	In evaluating whether we are the primary beneficiary, we evaluate our direct and indirect economic interests in the entity.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P13_S2	A reporting entity is determined to be the primary beneficiary if it holds a controlling financial interest in the VIE.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P13_S3	(2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from such entity that could potentially be significant to such entity.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P13_S4	Performance of that analysis requires the exercise of judgment.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P13_S5	We consider a variety of factors in identifying the entity that holds the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance including, but not limited to, the ability to direct financing, leasing, construction and other operating decisions and activities.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P13_S6	In addition, we consider the rights of other investors to participate in those decisions, to replace the manager and to sell or liquidate the entity.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P14_S0	whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE at the time we become involved with a variable interest entity and reconsider that conclusion continually.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P14_S1	We consolidate any VIE of which we are the primary beneficiary and disclose significant VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary, if any, as well as disclose our maximum exposure to loss related to VIEs that are not consolidated (see Note 4).
1138118_17_ITEM8_P15_S0	Voting Interest Entities (VOEs) For VOEs, we consolidate the entity if we have a controlling financial interest.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P15_S1	We have a controlling financial interest in a VOE if (i) for legal entities other than limited partnerships, we own a majority voting interest in the VOE or, for limited partnerships and similar entities, we own a majority of the entity s kick-out rights through voting limited partnership interests and (ii) non-controlling shareholders or partners do not hold substantive participating rights and no other conditions exist that would indicate that we do not control the entity.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P15_S2	Other Investments Our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, but do not control, or entities which are variable interest entities in which we are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for under the equity method.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P15_S3	We eliminate transactions with such equity method subsidiaries to the extent of our ownership in such subsidiaries.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P15_S4	Accordingly, our share of the earnings from these equity-method basis companies is included in consolidated net income.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P15_S5	All other investments held on a long-term basis are valued at cost less any impairment in value.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P15_S6	Under either the equity or cost method, impairment losses are recognized upon evidence of other-than-temporary losses of value.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P16_S0	When testing for impairment on investments that are not actively traded on a public market, we generally use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our investments and/or look to comparable activities in the marketplace.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P16_S1	Management s judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow approach.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P16_S2	These assumptions include net asset values, internal rates of return, discount and capitalization rates, interest rates and financing terms, rental rates, timing of leasing activity, estimates of lease terms and related concessions, etc.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P16_S3	When determining if impairment is other-than-temporary, we also look to the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been less than cost as well as the financial condition and near-term prospects of each investment.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P17_S0	Use of Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.), or GAAP, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P17_S1	These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses we report.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P17_S2	Such estimates include the value of goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets, accounts receivable, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, retirement and other post-employment benefits, among others.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P17_S3	These estimates and assumptions are based on management s best judgment, and are evaluated on an ongoing basis and adjusted, as needed, using historical experience and other factors, including consideration of the macroeconomic environment.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P17_S4	As future events and their effects cannot be forecast with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P17_S5	Changes in estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P18_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents generally consist of cash and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P18_S1	Included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 is cash and cash equivalents of $73.3 million and $70.2 million, respectively, from consolidated funds and other entities, which are not available for general corporate use.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P18_S2	We also manage certain cash and cash equivalents as an agent for our investment and property and facilities management clients.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P18_S3	These amounts are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets (see Note 16).
1138118_17_ITEM8_P19_S0	Restricted Cash Included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 is restricted cash of $68.8 million and $72.8 million, respectively.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P19_S1	The balances primarily include restricted cash set aside to cover funding obligations as required by contracts executed by us in the ordinary course of business.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P20_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist principally of trade receivables and interest-bearing investments.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P20_S1	Users of real estate services account for a substantial portion of trade receivables and collateral is generally not required.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P20_S2	The risk associated with this concentration is limited due to the large number of users and their geographic dispersion.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P21_S0	We place substantially all of our interest-bearing investments with several major financial institutions to limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P22_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment, which includes leasehold improvements, is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P22_S1	Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment is computed primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging up to 10 years.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P23_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the term of their associated leases, excluding options to renew, since such leases generally do not carry prohibitive penalties for non-renewal.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P24_S0	We capitalize expenditures that significantly increase the life of our assets and expense the costs of maintenance and repairs.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P24_S1	We review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P24_S2	If this review indicates that such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment is recognized in the period the changes occur and represents the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P25_S0	Certain costs related to the development or purchase of internal-use software are capitalized.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P25_S1	Internal-use software costs that are incurred in the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P25_S2	Significant direct consulting costs and certain payroll and related costs, which are incurred during the development stage of a project are generally capitalized and amortized over a three-year period (except for enterprise software development platforms, which range from three to seven years) when placed into production.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P26_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting, which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P27_S0	purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P27_S1	The majority of our goodwill balance has resulted from our acquisition of CBRE Services, Inc. (CBRE Services) in 2001 (the 2001 Acquisition), our acquisition of Insignia Financial Group, Inc. (Insignia) in 2003 (the Insignia Acquisition), our acquisition of the Trammell Crow Company in 2006 (the Trammell Crow Company Acquisition), our acquisition of substantially all of the ING Group N.V. (ING) Real Estate Investment Management (REIM) operations in Europe and Asia, as well as substantially all of Clarion Real Estate Securities (CRES) in 2011 (collectively referred to as the REIM Acquisitions), our acquisition of Norland Managed Services Ltd (Norland) in 2013 (the Norland Acquisition) and our acquisition of Johnson Controls, Inc. (JCI) s Global Workplace Solutions (JCI-GWS) business in 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P27_S2	Other intangible assets that have indefinite estimated useful lives that are not being amortized include certain management contracts identified in the REIM Acquisitions, a trademark, which was separately identified as a result of the 2001 Acquisition, as well as a trade name separately identified as a result of the REIM Acquisitions.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P27_S3	The remaining other intangible assets primarily include customer relationships, mortgage servicing rights, trademarks, management contracts and covenants not to compete, which are all being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging up to 20 years.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P27_S4	We are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually, or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P28_S0	The goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step process.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P29_S0	The first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P29_S1	We use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P29_S2	Management s judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P29_S3	These assumptions include revenue growth rates, profit margin percentages, discount rates, etc.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P30_S0	If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P30_S1	If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P31_S0	The second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P31_S1	The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one, over the estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P31_S2	Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business s fair value and the relative size of our goodwill, if different assumptions and estimates were used, it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P32_S0	Deferred Financing Costs Costs incurred in connection with financing activities are generally deferred and amortized over the terms of the related debt agreements ranging up to ten years.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P32_S1	Debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability are presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P32_S2	Amortization of these costs is charged to interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P33_S0	Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-15, Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements permits classifying debt issuance costs associated with a line of credit arrangement as an asset, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the arrangement.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P33_S1	Total deferred financing costs, net of accumulated amortization, related to our revolving line of credit have been included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and were $22.2 million and $22.1 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P34_S0	In connection with this amendment, we incurred approximately $5.4 million of financing costs.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P34_S1	During 2015, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement providing for a $500.0 million tranche A term loan facility and a $2.6 billion revolving credit facility.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P34_S2	In addition, we added new tranche B-1 and tranche B-2 term loan facilities under this same credit facility pursuant to which we borrowed an additional $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P34_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2015, in connection with these financing activities, we incurred approximately $21.7 million of financing costs, of which $1.0 million was expensed.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P34_S4	In addition, we expensed $1.7 million of previously-deferred financing costs.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P34_S5	All of these write-offs were included in write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P34_S6	During 2014, we completed three financing transactions, which included the issuance in September and December of $300.0 million and $125.0 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due March 15, 2025 and the redemption in October 2014 of all of the then outstanding 6.625% senior notes (aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million).
1138118_17_ITEM8_P34_S7	During the year ended December 31, 2014, in connection with these financing activities, we incurred approximately $4.7 million of financing costs.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P34_S8	In addition, we expensed $5.7 million of previously-deferred financing costs as well as a $17.4 million early extinguishment premium, all of which were included in write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P34_S9	See Note 10 for additional information on activities associated with our debt.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P35_S0	We record commission revenue on real estate sales generally upon close of escrow or transfer of title, except when future contingencies exist.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P35_S1	Real estate commissions on leases are generally recorded in revenue when all obligations under the commission agreement are satisfied.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P36_S0	Terms and conditions of a commission agreement may include, but are not limited to, execution of a signed lease agreement and future contingencies including tenant occupancy, payment of a deposit or payment of a first month s rent (or a combination thereof).
1138118_17_ITEM8_P36_S1	A commission agreement may provide that we earn a portion of a lease commission upon the execution of the lease agreement by the tenant and landlord, with the remaining portion(s) of the lease commission earned at a later date, usually upon tenant occupancy or payment of rent.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P36_S2	The existence of any significant future contingencies results in the delay of recognition of corresponding revenue until such contingencies are satisfied.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P36_S3	For example, if we do not earn all or a portion of the lease commission until the tenant pays its first month s rent, and the lease agreement provides the tenant with a free rent period, we delay revenue recognition until rent is paid by the tenant.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P36_S4	As some of these conditions are outside of our control and are often not clearly defined, judgment must be exercised in determining when such required events have occurred in order to recognize revenue.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P37_S0	Property and facilities management revenues are generally based on measures consistent with the terms of the customer contracts.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P38_S0	These contracts are negotiated utilizing a variety of terms covering various lengths of time.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P38_S1	The fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related agreements.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P38_S2	We also may earn revenue based on certain qualitative and quantitative performance measures.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P38_S3	We recognize this revenue when the performance has been completed, the measure has been calculated and fees are deemed collectible.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P39_S0	Our clients reimburse us for certain expenses incurred on their behalf, primarily in our property and facilities management operations.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P39_S1	Our treatment of these reimbursements is based upon the terms of the underlying contract.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P39_S2	We use certain indicators as to whether we record the reimbursements on a gross versus net basis, such as whether we are the primary obligor on the contracts, whether the contract is based on a fixed fee, credit risk and our discretion in making vendor selections and establishing prices.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P40_S0	In certain instances, we have determined we are acting as the principal in the transaction and, accordingly, report these reimbursements as revenue on a gross basis with the total costs reflected in cost of services.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P40_S1	Reimbursement revenue is recognized when the underlying reimbursable costs are incurred.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P40_S2	When we determine we are not the primary obligor and are acting as an agent, we account for the transaction on a net basis.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P41_S0	Investment management fees are based predominantly upon a percentage of the equity deployed on behalf of our limited partners.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P41_S1	Fees related to our indirect investment management programs are based upon a percentage of the fair value of those investments.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P41_S2	These fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related investment management agreements.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P42_S0	Our Global Investment Management segment earns performance-based incentive fees with regard to many of its investments.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P42_S1	Such revenue is recognized at the end of the measurement periods when the conditions of the applicable incentive fee arrangements have been satisfied and following the expiration of any potential claw back provision.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P42_S2	With many of these investments, our Global Investment Management professionals have participation interests in such incentive fees, which are commonly referred to as carried interest.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P42_S3	This carried interest expense is generally accrued for based upon the probability of such performance-based incentive fees being earned over the related vesting period.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P42_S4	In addition, our Global Investment Management segment also earns success-based transaction fees with regard to buying or selling properties on behalf of certain funds and separate accounts.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P42_S5	Such revenue is recognized at the completion of a successful transaction and is not subject to any claw back provision.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P43_S0	Appraisal fees are recorded after services have been rendered.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P43_S1	and we have no significant remaining obligations for performance in connection with the transaction, while loan servicing fees are recorded in revenue as monthly principal and interest payments are collected from mortgagors.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P43_S2	Other commissions, consulting fees and referral fees are recorded as revenue at the time the related services have been performed, unless future contingencies exist.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P44_S0	Development services and project management services generate fees from development and construction management projects.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P44_S1	Most development and construction management and project management assignments are subject to agreements that describe the calculation of fees and when we earn such fees.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P44_S2	The earnings terms of these agreements dictate when we recognize the related revenue.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P44_S3	Generally, development fees are recognized based on the lower of the amount billed or the amount determined on a straight-line basis over the development period.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P45_S0	We may earn incentive fees for project management services based upon achievement of certain performance criteria as set forth in the project management services agreement.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P45_S1	Incentive development fees are recognized when quantitative criteria have been met (such as specified leasing, budget or time-based targets) or for those incentive fees based on qualitative criteria, upon approval of the fee by our clients.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P45_S2	Certain incentive development fees allow us to share in the fair value of the developed real estate asset above cost.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P45_S3	This sharing creates additional revenue potential to us with no exposure to loss other than opportunity cost.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P45_S4	We recognize such fees when the specified target is attained and fees are deemed collectible.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P46_S0	We record deferred income to the extent that cash payments have been received in accordance with the terms of underlying agreements, but such amounts have not yet met the criteria for revenue recognition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P46_S1	We recognize such revenues when the appropriate criteria are met.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P47_S0	In establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables, we make assumptions with respect to future collectability.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P47_S1	Our assumptions are based on an assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends, including the aging of receivables balances.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P47_S2	In addition to these assessments, in general, outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are more than 180 days overdue are evaluated for collectability and fully provided for if deemed uncollectible.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P48_S0	However, estimating losses requires significant judgment, and conditions may change or new information may become known after any periodic evaluation.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P48_S1	As a result, actual credit losses may differ from our estimates.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P49_S0	The costs of business promotion and advertising are expensed as incurred.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P49_S1	Business promotion and advertising costs of $65.8 million, $62.7 million and $55.6 million were included in operating, administrative and other expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P50_S0	The financial statements of subsidiaries located outside the U.S. are generally measured using the local currency as the functional currency.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P50_S1	The assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date, and income and expenses are translated at the average monthly rate.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P50_S2	The resulting translation adjustments are included in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of equity.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P50_S3	Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the results of operations.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P51_S0	As required by FASB ASC Topic 815 Derivatives and Hedging , we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P51_S1	We do not net derivatives on our balance sheet.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P51_S2	The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P52_S0	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P52_S1	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P52_S2	Derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P53_S0	Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P54_S0	We may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of our risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or we elect not to apply hedge accounting.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P54_S1	In all cases, we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and, accordingly, do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P55_S0	Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive loss.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P55_S1	In the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, accumulated other comprehensive loss consists of foreign currency translation adjustments, fees associated with the termination of interest rate swaps, unrealized losses on interest rate swaps, unrealized holding gains (losses) on available for sale securities and pension liability adjustments.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P55_S2	Foreign currency translation adjustments exclude any income tax effect given that earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries are deemed to be reinvested for an indefinite period of time (see Note 13).
1138118_17_ITEM8_P56_S0	Marketable Securities We account for investments in marketable debt and equity securities in accordance with the Investments Debt and Equity Securities Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 320).
1138118_17_ITEM8_P57_S0	debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P58_S0	Marketable securities we acquire with the intent to generate a profit from short-term movements in market prices are classified as trading securities.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P58_S1	Debt securities are classified as held to maturity when we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P58_S2	Marketable equity and debt securities not classified as trading or held to maturity are classified as available for sale.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P59_S0	Trading securities are carried at their fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in net income.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P59_S1	Available for sale securities are carried at their fair value and any difference between cost and fair value is recorded as unrealized gain or loss, net of income taxes, and is reported as accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated statement of equity.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P60_S0	Premiums and discounts are recognized in interest using the effective interest method.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P60_S1	Realized gains and losses and declines in value expected to be other-than-temporary on available for sale securities have not been significant.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P61_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P61_S1	Interest and dividends on securities classified as available for sale are included in interest income.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P62_S0	For investments classified as available for sale, we assess impairment at the individual security level.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P62_S1	An investment is impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost basis.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P62_S2	When an impairment exists, we assess whether such impairment is temporary or other-than-temporary.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P62_S3	We review the volatility and intended holding period of our investments and also determine if we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that the value would be recovered over the intended holding period.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P62_S4	Based on our review, we did not record any significant other-than-temporary impairment losses during the years ending December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P63_S0	Our wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE Capital Markets, Inc. (CBRE Capital Markets) is a Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) approved Multifamily Program Plus Seller/Servicer and an approved Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) Aggregation and Negotiated Transaction Seller/Servicer.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P63_S1	In addition, CBRE Capital Markets wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE Multifamily Capital, Inc. (CBRE MCI) is an approved Fannie Mae Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS) Seller/Servicer and CBRE Capital Markets wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE HMF is a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) approved Non-Supervised Federal Housing Authority (FHA) Title II Mortgagee, an approved Multifamily Accelerated Processing (MAP) lender and an approved Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) issuer of mortgage-backed securities (MBS).
1138118_17_ITEM8_P64_S0	Under these arrangements, before loans are originated through proceeds from warehouse lines of credit, we obtain either a contractual loan purchase commitment from either Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae or a confirmed forward trade commitment for the issuance and purchase of a Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae MBS that will be secured by the loans.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P64_S1	The warehouse lines of credit are generally repaid within a one-month period when Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae buys the loans or upon settlement of the Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae MBS, while we retain the servicing rights.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P65_S0	Loans are funded at the prevailing market rates.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P66_S0	We elect the fair value option for all warehouse receivables.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P66_S1	At December 31, 2016 and 2015, all of the warehouse receivables included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were either under commitment to be purchased by Freddie Mac or had confirmed forward trade commitments for the issuance and purchase of Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities that will be secured by the underlying loans.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P67_S0	We also assume or purchase certain servicing assets.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P68_S0	Our mortgage service rights (MSRs) are initially recorded at fair value.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P68_S1	Subsequent to the initial recording, MSRs are amortized and carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value in other intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P68_S2	They are amortized in proportion to and over the estimated period that net servicing income is expected to be received based on projections and timing of estimated future net cash flows.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P68_S3	Our initial recording of MSRs at their fair value resulted in net gains, as the fair value of servicing contracts that result in MSR assets exceeded the fair value of servicing contracts that result in MSR liabilities.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P68_S4	The net assets and net gains are presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P69_S0	The amount of MSRs recognized during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_17_ITEM8_P70_S0	Mortgage servicing rights do not actively trade in an open market with readily available observable prices; therefore, fair value is determined based on certain assumptions and judgments, including the estimation of the present value of future cash flows realized from servicing the underlying mortgage loans.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P70_S1	Management s assumptions include the benefits of servicing (servicing fee income and interest on escrow deposits), inflation, the cost of servicing, prepayment rates, delinquencies, discount rates and the estimated life of servicing cash flows.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P70_S2	The assumptions used are subject to change based on management s judgments and estimates of changes in future cash flows and interest rates, among other things.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P70_S3	The key assumptions used during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 in measuring fair value were as follows:
1138118_17_ITEM8_P70_S4	The estimated fair value of our mortgage servicing rights was $375.5 million and $301.2 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P70_S5	Impairment is evaluated through a comparison of the carrying amount and fair value of the MSRs, and recognized with the establishment of a valuation allowance.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P70_S6	We did not incur any impairment charges related to our MRSs during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 or 2014.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P70_S7	No valuation allowance was created previously and we did not record a valuation allowance for MSRs in 2016 or 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P70_S8	Included in revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations are contractually specified servicing fees from loans serviced for others of $104.2 million, $78.9 million and $65.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and prepayment fees/late fees/ancillary income earned from loans serviced for others of $7.2 million, $8.4 million and $6.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P71_S0	Accounting for Broker Draws As part of our recruitment efforts relative to new U.S. brokers, we offer a transitional broker draw arrangement.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P71_S1	Our broker draw arrangements generally last until such time as a broker s pipeline of business is sufficient to allow him or her to earn sustainable commissions.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P72_S0	This program is intended to provide the broker with a minimal amount of cash flow to allow adequate time for his or her training as well as time for him or her to develop business relationships.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P72_S1	Similar to traditional salaries, the broker draws are paid irrespective of the actual revenues generated by the broker.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P72_S2	Often these broker draws represent the only form of compensation received by the broker.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P72_S3	Furthermore, it is not our general policy to pursue collection of unearned broker draws paid under this arrangement.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P72_S4	As a result, we have concluded that broker draws are economically equivalent to salaries paid and accordingly charge them to compensation expense as incurred.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P73_S0	The broker is also entitled to earn a commission on completed revenue transactions.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P73_S1	This amount is calculated as the commission that would have been payable under our full commission program, less any amounts previously paid to the broker in the form of a draw.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P74_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We account for all employee awards under the fair value recognition provisions of the Compensation Stock Compensation Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 718).
1138118_17_ITEM8_P74_S1	Topic 718 requires the measurement of compensation cost at the grant date, based upon the estimated fair value of the award, and requires amortization of the related expense over the employee s requisite service period.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P75_S0	In the third quarter of 2016, we elected to early adopt the provisions of ASU 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which required us to reflect any adjustments as of January 1, 2016, the beginning of the annual period that includes the interim period of adoption.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P76_S0	ASU 2016-09 permits companies to make an accounting policy election to either estimate forfeitures on share-based payment awards, as previously required, or to recognize forfeitures as they occur.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P76_S1	We elected to change our accounting policy to recognize forfeitures when they occur and the impact of this change in accounting policy has been recorded as a $3.3 million cumulative effect adjustment to accumulated earnings as of January 1, 2016.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P76_S2	Additionally, this ASU requires the recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies as income tax benefits or expenses in the income statement rather than to additional paid-in capital, which has been applied on a prospective basis to settlements of share-based payment awards occurring on or after January 1, 2016.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P76_S3	ASU 2016-09 also requires that excess tax benefits be presented as operating activities on the statement of cash flows, which we have elected to apply on a prospective basis.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P76_S4	See Note 12 for additional information on our stock-based compensation plans.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P77_S0	Basic income per share attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. is computed by dividing net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P77_S1	The computation of diluted income per share attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. generally further assumes the dilutive effect of potential common shares, which include stock options and certain contingently issuable shares.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P77_S2	Contingently issuable shares consist of non-vested stock awards.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P78_S0	Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with the Accounting for Income Taxes Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 740).
1138118_17_ITEM8_P79_S0	temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P79_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P79_S2	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P80_S0	Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P81_S0	Self-Insurance Our wholly-owned captive insurance company, which is subject to applicable insurance rules and regulations, insures our exposure related to workers compensation insurance, general liability insurance and automotive insurance for our U.S. operations risk on a primary basis and we purchase excess coverage from unrelated insurance carriers.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P81_S1	The captive insurance company also insures primary risk relating to professional indemnity claims globally.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P81_S2	Given the nature of these types of claims, it may take several years for resolution and determination of the cost of these claims.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P81_S3	We are required to estimate the cost of these claims in our financial statements.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P81_S4	The estimates that we utilize to record our potential losses on claims are inherently subjective, and actual claims could differ from amounts recorded, which could result in increased or decreased expense in future periods.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P81_S5	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our reserves for claims under these insurance programs were $80.6 million and $73.8 million, respectively, of which $1.7 million and $1.9 million, respectively, represented our estimated current liabilities.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P82_S0	The FASB has recently issued five ASUs related to revenue recognition ( new revenue recognition guidance ), all of which become effective for the company on January 1, 2018.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P82_S1	(2) in March 2016, ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net); (3) in April 2016, ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing; (4) in May 2016, ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-scope Improvements and Practical Expedients; and (5) in December 2016, ASU 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue From Contracts with Customers.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P83_S0	ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers and will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P83_S1	This ASU permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P83_S2	ASU 2016-08 clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P83_S3	ASU 2016-10 clarifies guidance related to identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation guidance contained in ASU 2014-09.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P83_S4	ASU 2016-12 clarifies guidance in certain narrow areas and adds some practical expedients.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P83_S5	ASU 2016-20 also clarifies guidance in certain narrow areas and adds optional exemptions to certain disclosure requirements.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P83_S6	We plan to adopt the new revenue recognition guidance in the first quarter of 2018 and are evaluating the application of a transition method.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P83_S7	We continue to evaluate the impact that adoption of these updates will have on our consolidated financial statements.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P84_S0	We are currently evaluating the impact of principal versus agent guidance in relation to third-party costs which are billed to clients in association with facilities management services and the impact, if any, on our consolidated financial statements.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P85_S0	(Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P85_S1	This ASU will significantly change the income statement impact of equity investments and the recognition of changes in fair value of financial liabilities when the fair value option is elected.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P85_S2	This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P85_S3	Early adoption is not permitted, except for the provisions related to the recognition of changes in fair value of financial liabilities when the fair value option is elected.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P85_S4	We do not believe the adoption of ASU 2016-01 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P86_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) .
1138118_17_ITEM8_P86_S1	This ASU requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet as liabilities, with corresponding right-of-use assets.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P86_S2	For income statement recognition purposes, leases will be classified as either a finance or operating lease in a manner similar to the requirements under the current lease accounting literature, but without relying upon the bright-line tests.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P86_S3	This ASU is effective for annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and mandates a modified retrospective transition method for all entities.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P86_S4	We plan to adopt ASU 2016-02 in the first quarter of 2019 and are currently evaluating the magnitude of its impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P87_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-05, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P87_S1	This ASU clarifies that a change in one of the parties to a derivative contract (through novation) that is part of a hedge accounting relationship does not, by itself, require designation of that relationship, as long as all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P87_S2	This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P88_S0	We do not believe the adoption of ASU 2016-05 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P89_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P89_S1	This ASU eliminates the requirement for an investor to retroactively apply the equity method when its increase in ownership interest (or degree of influence) in an investee triggers equity method accounting.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P89_S2	ASU 2016-07 should be applied prospectively upon its effective date to increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence that result in the adoption of the equity method.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P89_S3	This ASU is effective for all entities for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early application permitted.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P89_S4	We do not believe the application of ASU 2016-07 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P90_S0	In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P90_S1	This ASU is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring timelier recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments held by financial institutions and other organizations.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P90_S2	This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P91_S0	We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-13 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P92_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P92_S1	This ASU addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P93_S0	December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P94_S0	We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-15 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P95_S0	In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P95_S1	This ASU requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P95_S2	This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P95_S3	At this point in time, we do not believe the adoption of ASU 2016-16 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P96_S0	In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17, Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P96_S1	This ASU changes the evaluation of whether a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity by changing how a reporting entity that is a single decision maker of a variable interest entity treats indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P96_S2	This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P96_S3	We do not believe the adoption of ASU 2016-17 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P97_S0	In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P97_S1	This ASU requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P97_S2	As a result, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P97_S3	This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted.

1138118_17_ITEM8_P97_S6	This ASU amends a number of Topics in the FASB ASC.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P97_S7	The ASU is part of an ongoing FASB project to facilitate Codification updates for non-substantive technical corrections, clarifications, and improvements that are not expected to have a significant effect on accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost to most entities.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P97_S8	This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P97_S9	We do not believe the adoption of ASU 2016-19 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

1138118_17_ITEM8_P100_S1	This ASU eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P100_S2	This ASU also eliminates the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment and, if it fails that qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P100_S3	This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P100_S4	We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2017-04 will have on our goodwill assessment process, but do not believe the adoption of ASU 2017-04 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P101_S0	Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2015 and 2014 financial statements to conform with the 2016 presentation.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P102_S0	On September 1, 2015, CBRE, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, pursuant to a Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement with JCI, acquired JCI s GWS business (we refer to as the GWS Acquisition).
1138118_17_ITEM8_P102_S1	The acquired JCI-GWS business was a market-leading provider of integrated facilities management solutions for major occupiers of commercial real estate and had significant operations around the world.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P102_S2	The purchase price was $1.475 billion, paid in cash, plus adjustments totaling $46.5 million for working capital and other items.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P102_S3	We completed the GWS Acquisition in order to advance our strategy of delivering globally integrated services to major occupiers in our Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific segments.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P102_S4	We merged the acquired JCI-GWS business with our existing occupier outsourcing business line, and the new combined business adopted the Global Workplace Solutions name.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P102_S5	We financed the transaction with: (i) a new issuance in August 2015 of $600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due March 1, 2026; (ii) borrowings in September 2015 of $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of new tranche B-1 and tranche B-2 term loan facilities under our amended and restated credit agreement dated January 9, 2015 (2015 Credit Agreement); (iii) borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility under our 2015 Credit Agreement; and (iv) cash on hand.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P102_S6	See Note 10 for more information on the abovementioned debt instruments.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P103_S0	The purchase accounting for the GWS Acquisition, including assignment of goodwill to our reporting units, has been finalized.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P103_S1	There were no significant adjustments to the purchase price allocation recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P103_S2	The excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired of $796 million has been recorded to goodwill, with $406 million assigned to our Americas segment, $378 million assigned to our EMEA segment and $12 million assigned to our Asia Pacific segment.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P103_S3	The goodwill arising from the GWS Acquisition consists largely of the synergies and economies of scale expected from combining the operations acquired from JCI with our business.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P103_S4	Of the $796 million of goodwill recorded in connection with the GWS Acquisition, approximately $445 million is deductible for tax purposes.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P103_S5	The accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes revenue, operating income and net income of $982.0 million, $27.7 million and $18.8 million, respectively, attributable to the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P104_S0	$48.9 million and amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired of $24.2 million, all of which were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015 in connection with the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P104_S1	Unaudited pro forma results, assuming the GWS Acquisition had occurred as of January 1, 2014 for purposes of the 2015 and 2014 pro forma disclosures, are presented below.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P104_S2	They include certain adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2015, including $47.5 million of increased amortization expense as a result of intangible assets acquired in the GWS Acquisition, $22.4 million of additional interest expense as a result of debt incurred to finance the GWS Acquisition, the removal of $48.9 million of direct costs incurred by us related to the GWS Acquisition, and the tax impact for the year ended December 31, 2015 of these pro forma adjustments.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P104_S3	They also include certain adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2014, including $71.7 million of increased amortization expense as a result of intangible assets acquired in the GWS Acquisition, $38.1 million of additional interest expense as a result of debt incurred to finance the GWS Acquisition, and the tax impact for the year ended December 31, 2014 of these pro forma adjustments.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P105_S0	These pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of what operating results would have been had the GWS Acquisition occurred on January 1, 2014 and may not be indicative of future operating results (dollars in thousands, except share data): 4.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P106_S0	We hold variable interests in certain VIEs in our Global Investment Management and Development Services segments which are not consolidated as it was determined that we are not the primary beneficiary.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P106_S1	Our involvement with these entities is in the form of equity co-investments and fee arrangements.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P106_S2	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our maximum exposure to loss related to the VIEs which are not consolidated was as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_17_ITEM8_P107_S0	The Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic (Topic 820) of the FASB ASC defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P107_S1	Topic 820 also establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P107_S2	This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P107_S3	The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:
1138118_17_ITEM8_P108_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P109_S0	Level 2 Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P110_S0	Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P110_S1	This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P110_S2	There were no significant transfers in or out of Level 1 and Level 2 during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P110_S3	The following tables present the fair value of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands):
1138118_17_ITEM8_P111_S0	The fair values of the warehouse receivables are calculated based on already locked in security buy prices.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P111_S1	At December 31, 2016 and 2015, all of the warehouse receivables included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were either under commitment to be purchased by Freddie Mac or had confirmed forward trade commitments for the issuance and purchase of Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae mortgage backed securities that will be secured by the underlying loans (See Note 2).
1138118_17_ITEM8_P111_S2	These assets are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as all inputs are readily observable.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P112_S0	The valuation of interest rate swaps and foreign currency exchange forward contracts is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P112_S1	This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate and foreign currency exchange forward curves.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P113_S0	The fair values of interest rate swaps and foreign currency exchange forward contracts are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future estimated cash payments/receipts.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P113_S1	The estimated cash flows are based on an expectation of future interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates using forward curves derived from observable market interest rate and foreign currency exchange forward curves.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P114_S0	The valuation of our loan commitments is determined using discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P114_S1	The primary source of value of each written loan commitment is future servicing rights.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P114_S2	Mortgage servicing rights do not actively trade in an open market with readily available observable prices; therefore, fair value is determined based on certain assumptions and judgments, including the estimation of the present value of future cash flows realized from servicing the underlying mortgage loans (see Note 2).
1138118_17_ITEM8_P115_S0	our loan commitments are classified in Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P115_S1	The following table provides additional information about fair value measurements for these Level 3 assets for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands): Fair value measurements for our available for sale securities are obtained from independent pricing services which utilize observable market data that may include quoted market prices, dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. treasury yield curve, trading levels, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the instrument s terms and conditions.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P116_S0	The trading securities and securities sold, not yet purchased are primarily in the U.S. and are generally valued at the last reported sales price on the day of valuation or, if no sales occurred on the valuation date, at the mean of the bid and asked prices on such date.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P116_S1	There were no significant non-recurring fair value measurements recorded during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P116_S2	The following non-recurring fair value measurements were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2014 (dollars in thousands):
1138118_17_ITEM8_P117_S0	The fair value measurements employed for our impairment evaluations were generally based on third-party information available in non-active markets (such as third-party appraisals and offers received from third parties) as well as a discounted cash flow approach and/or review of comparable activities in the market place.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P117_S1	Inputs used in these evaluations included risk-free rates of return, estimated risk premiums as well as other economic variables.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P118_S0	Property and Equipment During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded an asset impairment of $8.6 million in our Americas segment.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P118_S1	This non-cash write-off resulted from the decision (due to a change in strategy) to abandon a property database platform that was being developed in the U.S. and was included within operating, administrative and other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P119_S0	Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded write-downs in our Global Investment Management segment of $3.6 million, of which $0.8 million were attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P119_S1	These write-downs were primarily driven by challenging market conditions and a decrease in the estimated holding period of certain assets.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P119_S2	All of our impairment charges related to investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries were included in equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P120_S0	Real Estate During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a provision for loss on real estate held for sale of $1.9 million, of which $1.8 million was attributable to non-controlling interests.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P120_S1	This charge reduced the carrying value of certain assets to their fair value, less cost to sell, primarily due to reduced selling prices resulting from a decrease in the estimated holding period of certain assets.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P120_S2	All of the abovementioned charges were reported in our Development Services segment.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P120_S3	All of the abovementioned charges were included within operating, administrative and other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P121_S0	FASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P121_S1	Our financial instruments are as follows:
1138118_17_ITEM8_P122_S0	These balances include cash and cash equivalents as well as restricted cash with maturities of less than three months.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P122_S1	The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P123_S0	Receivables, less Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Due to their short-term nature, fair value approximates carrying value.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P124_S0	These balances are carried at fair value based on market prices at the balance sheet date.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P125_S0	Trading and Available for Sale Securities These investments are carried at their fair value.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P126_S0	Foreign Currency Exchange Forward Contracts These assets and liabilities are carried at their fair value as calculated by using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P127_S0	Securities Sold, not yet Purchased These liabilities are carried at their fair value.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P128_S0	The majority of this balance represents outstanding amounts under our warehouse lines of credit of our wholly-owned subsidiary, CBRE Capital Markets.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P128_S1	Due to the short-term nature and variable interest rates of these instruments, fair value approximates carrying value (see Note 10).
1138118_17_ITEM8_P129_S0	Interest Rate Swaps These liabilities are carried at their fair value as calculated by using widely-accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative (see Note 6).
1138118_17_ITEM8_P130_S0	Notes Payable on Real Estate: As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the carrying value of our notes payable on real estate, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, was $26.0 million and $38.3 million, respectively.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P130_S1	These notes payable were not recourse to CBRE Group, Inc., except for being recourse to the single-purpose entities that held the real estate assets and were the primary obligors on the notes payable.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P131_S0	These borrowings have either fixed interest rates or floating interest rates at spreads added to a market index.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P132_S0	Although it is possible that certain portions of our notes payable on real estate may have fair values that differ from their carrying values, based on the terms of such loans as compared to current market conditions, or other factors specific to the borrower entity, we do not believe that the fair value of our notes payable is significantly different than their carrying value.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P133_S0	Derivative Financial Instruments We are exposed to certain risks arising from both our business operations and economic conditions.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P133_S1	We manage economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources and duration of our debt funding and by using derivative financial instruments.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P133_S2	Specifically, we enter into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the payment of future known but uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P133_S3	Our derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing and duration of our known or expected cash payments principally related to our borrowings.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P134_S0	We do not net derivatives on our balance sheet.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P134_S1	Our objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P134_S2	To accomplish this objective, we primarily use interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P134_S3	In July 2015, we entered into three interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $300.0 million, all with effective dates in August 2015, and designated them as cash flow hedges in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging .
1138118_17_ITEM8_P134_S4	We structured these swap agreements to attempt to hedge the variability of future interest payments due to changes in interest rates prior to us issuing the 4.875% senior notes (see Note 10).
1138118_17_ITEM8_P134_S5	In August 2015, we elected to terminate these agreements and paid a $6.2 million cash settlement, which was recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and is being amortized to interest expense throughout the remaining term of the terminated hedge transaction until August 2025.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P134_S6	There was no hedge ineffectiveness for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P134_S7	We reclassified $0.6 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P134_S8	During the next twelve months, we estimate that $0.6 million will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P135_S0	In March 2011, we entered into five interest rate swap agreements, all with effective dates in October 2011, and immediately designated them as cash flow hedges in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P136_S0	these interest rate swap agreements is to attempt to hedge potential changes to our cash flows due to the variable interest nature of our senior term loan facilities.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P136_S1	The total notional amount of these interest rate swap agreements is $400.0 million, with $200.0 million expiring in October 2017 and $200.0 million expiring in September 2019.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P137_S0	The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P137_S1	There was no significant hedge ineffectiveness for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P138_S0	The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the balance sheet and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P138_S1	We reclassified $10.7 million, $11.9 million and $12.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P138_S2	During the next twelve months, we estimate that $7.8 million will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P138_S3	In addition, we recorded net losses of $2.4 million, $6.5 million and $9.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, to other comprehensive loss in relation to such interest rate swap agreements.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P138_S4	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the fair values of such interest rate swap agreements were reflected as a $13.2 million liability and a $21.5 million liability, respectively, and were included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P139_S0	Additionally, our foreign operations expose us to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P139_S1	These fluctuations may impact the value of our cash receipts and payments in terms of our functional (reporting) currency, which is U.S. dollars.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P139_S2	We enter into derivative financial instruments to attempt to protect the value or fix the amount of certain obligations in terms of our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P139_S3	In March 2014, we began a foreign currency exchange forward hedging program (which expired in December 2016) by entering into foreign currency exchange forward contracts, including agreements to buy U.S. dollars and sell Australian dollars, British pound sterling, Canadian dollars, euros and Japanese yen.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P139_S4	The purpose of these forward contracts was to attempt to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that would adversely impact some of our foreign currency denominated EBITDA.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P139_S5	Hedge accounting was not elected for any of these contracts.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P139_S6	As such, changes in the fair values of these contracts were recorded directly in earnings.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P139_S7	Included in the consolidated statement of operations were net gains of $7.7 million, $24.2 million and $5.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, resulting from net gains on foreign currency exchange forward contracts.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P139_S8	As of December 31, 2016, we had no foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding as the program has expired.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P139_S9	As of December 31, 2015, the fair value of forward contracts with six counterparties aggregated to an $8.9 million asset position, which was included in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P139_S10	As of December 31, 2015, the fair value of forward contracts with two counterparties aggregated to a $1.1 million liability position, which was included in other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P139_S11	We also routinely monitor our exposure to currency exchange rate changes in connection with certain transactions and sometimes enter into foreign currency exchange option and forward contracts to limit our exposure to such transactions, as appropriate.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P139_S12	In the ordinary course of business, we also sometimes utilize derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange contracts to attempt to mitigate foreign currency exchange exposure resulting from intercompany loans.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P139_S13	The net impact on our financial position and earnings resulting from these foreign currency exchange forward and options contracts has not been significant.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P140_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment consists of the following (dollars in thousands): Depreciation and amortization expense associated with property and equipment was $151.2 million, $137.2 million and $122.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P140_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded an impairment loss related to property and equipment of $8.6 million (see Note 5 for additional information).
1138118_17_ITEM8_P140_S2	We did not recognize any significant impairment losses related to property and equipment in 2016 and 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P140_S3	The following table summarizes the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands):
1138118_17_ITEM8_P141_S0	During 2016, we acquired our independent affiliate in Norway, a London-based retail property advisor specializing in the luxury goods retail sector and a leading provider of retail project management, shopping center development and tenant coordination services in the U.S. During 2015, we completed eight in-fill acquisitions, including a Seattle-based leader in capital markets services for affordable housing, a Texas-based commercial real estate firm specializing in retail services, an energy management specialist based in Brookfield, Wisconsin, a Chicago-based location data analytics firm, one of the leading retail real estate services firms in the Midwestern U.S., an advisory, consulting and research firm specializing in the Canadian hospitality and tourism industries and our former independent affiliate companies in Columbia, South Carolina, and Memphis, Tennessee.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P142_S0	Our annual assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives has historically been completed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P142_S1	We performed the 2016, 2015 and 2014 assessments as of October 1.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P142_S2	When we performed our required annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we determined that no impairment existed as the estimated fair value of our reporting units was in excess of their carrying value.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P143_S0	Other intangible assets totaled $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, net of accumulated amortization of $771.7 million and $589.2 million, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are comprised of the following (dollars in thousands): Unamortizable intangible assets include management contracts identified as a result of the REIM Acquisitions relating to relationships with open-end funds, a trademark separately identified as a result of the 2001 Acquisition and a trade name separately identified in connection with the REIM Acquisitions, which represents the Clarion Partners trade name in the U.S. These intangible assets have indefinite useful lives and accordingly are not being amortized.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P144_S0	Customer relationships relate to existing relationships mainly in the brokerage, occupier outsourcing and property management lines of business that were primarily identified in the Trammell Crow Company Acquisition, the Norland Acquisition and the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P144_S1	These intangible assets are being amortized over useful lives of up to 20 years.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P145_S0	Mortgage servicing rights represent the carrying value of servicing assets in our mortgage brokerage line of business in the U.S.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P145_S1	The mortgage servicing rights are being amortized over the estimated period that net servicing income is expected to be received, which is typically up to ten years.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P145_S2	In connection with the GWS Acquisition, trademarks of approximately $280 million were separately identified and are being amortized over 20 years.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P145_S3	A trade name of approximately $35 million was separately identified as a result of the Norland Acquisition and was fully amortized as of December 31, 2015.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P146_S0	Management contracts consist primarily of asset management contracts relating to relationships with closed-end funds and separate accounts in the U.S., Europe and Asia that were separately identified as a result of the REIM Acquisitions.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P146_S1	These management contracts are being amortized over useful lives of up to 13 years.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P146_S2	A covenant not to compete of approximately $74 million was separately identified in connection with the GWS Acquisition and is being amortized over three years.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P146_S3	Other amortizable intangible assets mainly represent transition costs and are being amortized over useful lives of up to 20 years.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P146_S4	Amortization expense related to intangible assets was $211.7 million, $175.3 million and $138.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P146_S5	The estimated annual amortization expense for each of the years ending December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2021 approximates $206.7 million, $186.0 million, $132.9 million, $111.8 million and $97.4 million, respectively.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P147_S0	Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries Investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.

1138118_17_ITEM8_P176_S0	Substantially all leases require us to pay maintenance costs, insurance and property taxes.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P176_S1	The composition of total rental expense under noncancellable operating leases consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_17_ITEM8_P177_S0	In January 2008, CBRE MCI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBRE Capital Markets, entered into an agreement with Fannie Mae under Fannie Mae s DUS Program to provide financing for multifamily housing with five or more units.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P177_S1	Under the DUS Program, CBRE MCI originates, underwrites, closes and services loans without prior approval by Fannie Mae, and in selected cases, is subject to sharing up to one-third of any losses on loans originated under the DUS Program.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P177_S2	CBRE MCI has funded loans subject to such loss sharing arrangements with unpaid principal balances of $16.6 billion at December 31, 2016.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P178_S0	CBRE MCI, under its agreement with Fannie Mae, must post cash reserves or other acceptable collateral under formulas established by Fannie Mae to provide for sufficient capital in the event losses occur.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P178_S1	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, CBRE MCI had a $45.0 million and a $35.0 million, respectively, letter of credit under this reserve arrangement, and had provided approximately $28.2 million and $21.8 million, respectively, of loan loss accruals.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P178_S2	Fannie Mae s recourse under the DUS Program is limited to the assets of CBRE MCI, which assets totaled approximately $798.8 million (including $588.5 million of warehouse receivables, a substantial majority of which are pledged against warehouse lines of credit and are therefore not available to Fannie Mae) at December 31, 2016.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P178_S3	We had outstanding letters of credit totaling $50.9 million as of December 31, 2016, excluding letters of credit for which we have outstanding liabilities already accrued on our consolidated balance sheet related to our subsidiaries outstanding reserves for claims under certain insurance programs as well as letters of credit related to operating leases.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P178_S4	CBRE MCI s letter of credit totaling $45.0 million as of December 31, 2016 referred to in the preceding paragraph represented the majority of the $50.9 million outstanding letters of credit as of such date.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P178_S5	The remaining letters of credit are primarily executed by us in the ordinary course of business and expire at varying dates through November 2017.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P178_S6	We had guarantees totaling $56.6 million as of December 31, 2016, excluding guarantees related to pension liabilities, consolidated indebtedness and other obligations for which we have outstanding liabilities already accrued on our consolidated balance sheet, and excluding guarantees related to operating leases.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P178_S7	The $56.6 million primarily represents guarantees executed by us in the ordinary course of business, including various guarantees of management and vendor contracts in our operations overseas, which expire at the end of each of the respective agreements.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P178_S8	In addition, as of December 31, 2016, we had issued numerous non-recourse carveout, completion and budget guarantees relating to development projects for the benefit of third parties.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P178_S9	These guarantees are commonplace in our industry and are made by us in the ordinary course of our Development Services business.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P178_S10	Non-recourse carveout guarantees generally require that our project-entity borrower not commit specified improper acts, with us potentially liable for all or a portion of such entity s indebtedness or other damages suffered by the lender if those acts occur.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P179_S0	Completion and budget guarantees generally require us to complete construction of the relevant project within a specified timeframe and/or within a specified budget, with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P180_S0	These contracts are intended to pass the risk to such contractors.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P180_S1	While there can be no assurance, we do not expect to incur any material losses under these guarantees.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P181_S0	An important part of the strategy for our Global Investment Management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P181_S1	These co-investments generally total up to 2.0% of the equity in a particular fund.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P181_S2	As of December 31, 2016, we had aggregate commitments of $31.6 million to fund future co-investments.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P181_S3	Additionally, an important part of our Development Services business strategy is to invest in unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries as a principal (in most cases co-investing with our clients).
1138118_17_ITEM8_P181_S4	As of December 31, 2016, we had committed to fund $23.0 million of additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries.

1138118_17_ITEM8_P193_S2	Our time-vesting awards generally vest 25% per year over four years from the grant date.

1138118_17_ITEM8_P196_S2	The 401(k) Plan provides for participant contributions as well as a company match.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P196_S3	A participant is allowed to contribute to the 401(k) Plan from 1% to 75% of his or her compensation, subject to limits imposed by applicable law.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P196_S4	Effective January 1, 2007, all participants hired post January 1, 2007 vest in company match contributions 20% per year for each plan year they work 1,000 hours.

1138118_17_ITEM8_P196_S6	For 2016, 2015, and 2014, we contributed a 50% match on the first 6%, 5% and 4%, respectively, of annual compensation (up to $150,000 of compensation) deferred by each participant.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P196_S7	In connection with the 401(k) Plan, we charged to expense $44.3 million, $29.0 million and $21.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P197_S0	Participants are entitled to invest up to 25% of their 401(k) account balance in shares of our common stock.

1138118_17_ITEM8_P198_S0	We have two contributory defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom (U.K.).
1138118_17_ITEM8_P199_S0	A subsidiary of Insignia, which we acquired in connection with the Insignia Acquisition in 2003, also had a contributory defined benefit pension plan in the U.K.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P199_S1	Our subsidiaries based in the U.K. maintain the plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in these plans.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P199_S2	With respect to these plans, our historical policy has been to contribute annually to the plans, an amount to fund pension liabilities as actuarially determined and as required by applicable laws and regulations.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P199_S3	Our contributions to these plans are invested by the plan trustee and, if these investments do not perform well in the future, we may be required to provide additional contributions to cover any pension underfunding.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P199_S4	Effective July 1, 2007, we reached agreements with the active members of these plans to freeze future pension plan benefits.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P199_S5	In return, the active members became eligible to enroll in a defined contribution plan.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P200_S0	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the fair values of pension plan assets were $286.6 million and $305.5 million, respectively, and the fair values of projected benefit obligations in aggregate were $416.9 million and $377.5 million, respectively.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P200_S1	As a result, the plans were underfunded by approximately $130.3 million and $72.0 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and were recorded as net liabilities included in other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P200_S2	Items not yet recognized as a component of net periodic pension (benefit) cost were $209.6 million and $132.8 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and were included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P200_S3	Net periodic pension (benefit) cost was not material for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P200_S4	The components of income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes consisted of the following (dollars in thousands): Our tax provision (benefit) consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_17_ITEM8_P201_S0	The following is a reconciliation stated as a percentage of pre-tax income of the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate:
1138118_17_ITEM8_P201_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, we recorded a $0.4 million, $3.2 million and $2.2 million income tax benefit in connection with stock options exercised.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P201_S2	Of this income tax benefit, $2.3 million and $1.2 million was charged directly to additional paid-in capital within the equity section of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P201_S3	With our adoption of ASU 2016-09 in the third quarter of 2016, which has been applied on a prospective basis to settlements of share-based payment awards occurring on or after January 1, 2016, excess tax benefits for 2016 have been recognized as income tax benefits in the income statement rather than to additional paid-in capital.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P201_S4	Cumulative tax effects of temporary differences are shown below at December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands):
1138118_17_ITEM8_P202_S0	As of December 31, 2016, we had U.S. federal NOLs of approximately $39.1 million, translating to a deferred tax asset before valuation allowance of $13.7 million, which will begin to expire in 2023.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P203_S0	December 31, 2016, there were also deferred tax assets before valuation allowances of approximately $2.9 million related to state NOLs as well as $48.6 million related to foreign NOLs.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P203_S1	The state and foreign NOLs both begin to expire in 2017, but the majority carry forward indefinitely.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P204_S0	The utilization of NOLs may be subject to certain limitations under U.S. federal, state and foreign laws.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P204_S1	In addition, as of December 31, 2016, we had $54.0 million of foreign income tax credits that can be utilized to offset U.S. federal income taxes on foreign-sourced earnings.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P204_S2	These credits are scheduled to expire in 2023.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P205_S0	We determined that as of December 31, 2016, $105.5 million of deferred tax assets do not satisfy the realization criteria set forth in Topic 740.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P205_S1	Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been recorded for this amount.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P205_S2	If released, the entire amount would result in a benefit to continuing operations.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P205_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2016, our valuation allowance increased by approximately $13.9 million.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P205_S4	This resulted from establishment of valuation allowances of $16.9 million related to non-U.S. net operating losses and other foreign assets and $0.9 million related to U.S. net operating losses and other U.S. assets.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P205_S5	These increases were partially offset by $2.8 million of non-U.S. net operating loss utilization, $0.6 million of U.S. net operating loss utilization and $0.5 million of foreign currency translation.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P205_S6	We believe it is more likely than not that future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets recorded net of these valuation allowances.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P205_S7	Our foreign subsidiaries have accumulated $1.9 billion of undistributed earnings for which we have not recorded a deferred tax liability.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P205_S8	Although tax liabilities might result from dividends being paid out of these earnings, or as a result of a sale or liquidation of non-U.S. subsidiaries, these earnings are permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. and we do not have any plans to repatriate them or to sell or liquidate any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P205_S9	To the extent that we are able to repatriate the earnings in a tax efficient manner, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds, net of foreign tax credits.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P205_S10	Determining our tax liability upon repatriation is not practicable.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P205_S11	Cash and cash equivalents owned by non-U.S. subsidiaries totaled $408.9 million at December 31, 2016.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P205_S12	The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $94.9 million and $92.5 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P205_S13	The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect our effective tax rate, if recognized, is $39.1 million ($35.7 million, net of federal benefit received from state positions) and $43.8 million ($40.7 million, net of federal benefit received from state positions) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P205_S14	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_17_ITEM8_P206_S0	We believe it is reasonably possible that between $61.6 million and $63.1 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits will be settled during the next twelve months due to filing amended returns and settling ongoing exams.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P206_S1	Our continuing practice is to recognize potential accrued interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters within income tax expense.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P206_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we accrued an additional $2.9 million, $3.2 million and $3.0 million, respectively, in interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P206_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2014, we reversed $10.5 million of accrued interest and penalties related to settled positions.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P206_S4	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we have recognized a liability for interest and penalties of $31.7 million ($24.3 million, net of related federal benefit received from interest expense) and $28.8 million ($22.1 million, net of related federal benefit received from interest expense), respectively.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P207_S0	We conduct business globally and, as a result, one or more of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in multiple state, local and foreign jurisdictions.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P207_S1	We are no longer open to assessment by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for years prior to 2005.
1138118_17_ITEM8_P207_S2	With limited exception, our significant state and foreign tax jurisdictions are no longer subject to audit by the various tax authorities for tax years prior to 2007.

1138118_17_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Securities Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f), including maintenance of (i) records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets, and (ii) policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance that (a) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, (b) our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our board of directors and (c) we will prevent or timely detect unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1138118_17_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control.
1138118_17_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses of judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.
1138118_17_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper overriding of controls.
1138118_17_ITEM9A_P1_S3	As a result of such limitations, there is risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
1138118_17_ITEM9A_P1_S4	However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
1138118_17_ITEM9A_P1_S5	Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
1138118_17_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission.
1138118_17_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Based on our evaluation under the COSO framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2016.
1138118_17_ITEM9A_P2_S2	The effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.
1138118_17_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Disclosure Controls and Procedures Rule 13a-15 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires that we conduct an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report, and we have a disclosure policy in furtherance of the same.
1138118_17_ITEM9A_P3_S1	This evaluation is designed to ensure that all corporate disclosure is complete and accurate in all material respects.
1138118_17_ITEM9A_P3_S2	The evaluation is further designed to ensure that all information required to be disclosed in our SEC reports is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods and in the manner specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
1138118_17_ITEM9A_P3_S3	Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
1138118_17_ITEM9A_P3_S4	Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer supervise and participate in this evaluation, and they are assisted by our Deputy Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer and other members of our Disclosure Committee.
1138118_17_ITEM9A_P3_S5	In addition to our Deputy Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, our Disclosure Committee consists of our General Counsel, the chief communication officer, our corporate controller, our head of Global Internal Audit, our senior officers of significant business lines and other select employees.
1138118_17_ITEM9A_P4_S0	We conducted the required evaluation, and our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined by Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) were effective as of December 31, 2016 to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level.
1138118_17_ITEM9A_P4_S1	No changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

1138118_18_ITEM1_P0_S0	Company Overview CBRE Group, Inc. is a Delaware corporation.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P0_S1	References to the company, we, us and our refer to CBRE Group, Inc. and include all of its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or the context requires otherwise.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P0_S2	We are the world s largest commercial real estate services and investment firm, based on 2017 revenue, with leading global market positions in our leasing, property sales, occupier outsourcing and valuation businesses.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P0_S3	As of December 31, 2017, we operated in more than 450 offices worldwide with over 80,000 employees, excluding independent affiliates.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P0_S4	We serve clients in more than 100 countries.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P0_S5	Our business is focused on providing services to both occupiers of real estate and investors in real estate.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P0_S6	For occupiers, we provide facilities management, project management, transaction (both property sales and tenant leasing) and consulting services, among others.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P0_S7	For investors, we provide capital markets (property sales, commercial mortgage brokerage, loan origination and servicing), leasing, investment management, property management, valuation and development services, among others.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P0_S8	We provide commercial real estate services under the CBRE brand name, investment management services under the CBRE Global Investors brand name and development services under the Trammell Crow Company brand name.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P0_S9	Our revenue mix has shifted in recent years toward more contractual revenue as occupiers and investors increasingly prefer to purchase integrated, account-based services from firms that meet the full spectrum of their needs nationally and globally.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P0_S10	We believe we are well-positioned to capture a growing share of this business.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P0_S11	We generate revenue from both management fees (large multi-year portfolio and per-project contracts) and commissions on transactions.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P0_S12	Our contractual, fee-for-services businesses generally involve occupier outsourcing (including facilities and project management), property management, investment management, appraisal/valuation and loan servicing).
1138118_18_ITEM1_P0_S13	In addition, our leasing services business line is largely recurring in nature over time.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P0_S14	In 2017, we generated revenue from a highly diversified base of clients, including more than 90 of the Fortune 100 companies.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P0_S15	We have been an S P 500 company since 2006 and in 2017 we were ranked #214 on the Fortune 500.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P0_S16	We have been voted the most recognized commercial real estate brand in a Lipsey Company survey for 17 years in a row (including 2018).
1138118_18_ITEM1_P0_S17	We have also been rated a World s Most Ethical Company by the Ethisphere Institute for five consecutive years.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P1_S0	We marked our 112th year of continuous operations in 2018, tracing our origins to a company founded in San Francisco in the aftermath of the 1906 earthquake.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P1_S1	Since then, we have grown into the largest global commercial real estate services and investment firm (in terms of 2017 revenue) through organic growth and a series of strategic acquisitions.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P1_S2	Among these are the following acquisitions: Global Workplace Solutions (September 2015); Norland Managed Services Ltd (December 2013); ING Group N.V. s Real Estate Investment Management (REIM) operations in Europe and Asia (October 2011) and its U.S.-based global real estate listed securities business (July 2011); and Trammell Crow Company (December 2006).

1138118_18_ITEM1_P2_S2	CBRE Services, Inc., our direct wholly-owned subsidiary, is also a holding company and is the primary obligor or issuer with respect to most of our long-term indebtedness.

1138118_18_ITEM1_P4_S0	The Americas The Americas is our largest reporting segment, comprised of operations throughout the United States and Canada as well as key markets in Latin America.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P4_S1	Most of our operations are conducted through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE, Inc.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P4_S2	Our mortgage loan origination, sales and servicing operations are conducted exclusively through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary operating under the name CBRE Capital Markets, Inc., or CBRE Capital Markets, and its subsidiaries.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P4_S3	Our operations in Canada are conducted through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE Limited and our operations in Latin America are operated through various indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P4_S4	Our Americas segment accounted for 55.3% of our 2017 revenue, 55.4% of our 2016 revenue and 57.1% of our 2015 revenue.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P4_S5	Our operations also include independent affiliates to whom we license the CBRE name in their local markets in return for payments of annual or quarterly royalty fees to us and an agreement to cross-refer business between us and the affiliate.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P4_S6	Revenue from affiliates totaled less than 1% of total revenue in our Americas segment in 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P5_S0	Within our Americas segment, we organize our services into several business lines, as further described below.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P6_S0	Leasing Services Through our Advisory Transaction Services business line, we provide strategic advice and execution to owners, investors and occupiers in connection with leasing of office, industrial and retail space.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P6_S1	We generate significant repeat business from existing clients, which, for example, accounted for approximately 71% of our U.S. leasing activity in 2017, including referrals from other parts of our business.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P6_S2	We believe we are a market leader for the provision of these services in most top U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau), including Atlanta, Austin, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Francisco, and Seattle.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P6_S3	Capital Markets We offer clients fully integrated property sales and mortgage and structured financing services under the CBRE Capital Markets brand.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P6_S4	The tight integration of these services helps to meet marketplace demand for comprehensive capital markets solutions.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P6_S5	During 2017, we concluded approximately $130.4 billion of capital markets transactions in the Americas, including $87.2 billion of property sales transactions and $43.2 billion of mortgage originations and loan sales.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P6_S6	We are the leading property sales advisor in the United States, accounting for approximately 17% of investment sales transactions greater than $2.5 million across office, industrial, retail, multifamily and hotel properties in 2017, according to Real Capital Analytics.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P7_S0	Our mortgage brokerage business brokers, originates and services commercial mortgage loans primarily through relationships established with national and regional banks, credit companies, insurance companies, pension funds, investment banking firms and government agencies.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P7_S1	In the Americas, our mortgage loan origination volume in 2017 was $42.8 billion, including approximately $17.9 billion for U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs).
1138118_18_ITEM1_P7_S2	Most of the GSE loans were financed through revolving warehouse credit lines through a CBRE subsidiary that is dedicated exclusively for this purpose and were substantially risk mitigated by either obtaining a contractual purchase commitment from the GSE or confirming a forward-trade commitment for the issuance and purchase of a mortgage-backed security that will be secured by the loan.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P7_S3	We advised on the sale of approximately $0.4 billion of mortgages on behalf of financial institutions in 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P8_S0	We also oversee a loan servicing portfolio, which totaled approximately $141 billion in the Americas (approximately $174 billion globally) at year-end 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P9_S0	Our real estate services professionals are compensated primarily through commissions, which are payable upon completion of an assignment.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P9_S1	This mitigates the effect of compensation, our largest expense, on our operating margins during difficult market conditions.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P9_S2	We strive to retain top professionals through an attractive compensation program tied to productivity as well as greater investments in support resources, including professional development and training, market research and information, technology, branding and marketing, than most other firms in our sector.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P9_S3	We further strengthen our relationships with our real estate services clients by offering proprietary research to them through CBRE Research and CBRE Econometric Advisors, our commercial real estate market information and forecasting groups.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P10_S0	Valuation We provide valuation services that include market-value appraisals, litigation support, discounted cash flow analyses, feasibility studies as well as consulting services such as property condition reports, hotel advisory and environmental consulting.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P10_S1	Our valuation business has developed proprietary systems for data management, analysis and valuation report preparation, which we believe provide us with an advantage over our competitors.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P10_S2	We believe that our valuation business is one of the largest in the commercial real estate industry.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P10_S3	During 2017, we completed nearly 70,000 valuation, appraisal and advisory assignments in the Americas.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P11_S0	We provide a broad suite of services to occupiers of real estate, including facilities management, project management, transaction management and strategic consulting.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P11_S1	We report facilities and project management as well as strategic consulting activities in our occupier outsourcing revenue line and transaction management in our lease and sales revenue lines.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P11_S2	We believe the outsourcing of commercial real estate services is a long-term trend in our industry, with occupiers, such as corporations, public sector entities, health care providers and others, achieving better execution and improved efficiency by relying on the expertise of third-party real estate specialists.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P11_S3	We typically enter into multi-year, often multi-service, outsourcing contracts with our clients and also provide services on a one-off assignment or a short-term contract basis.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P12_S0	Facilities management involves the day-to-day management of client-occupied space and includes headquarter buildings, regional offices, administrative offices, data centers and other critical facilities, manufacturing and laboratory facilities, distribution facilities and retail space.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P12_S1	Contracts for facilities management services are often structured so we are reimbursed for client-dedicated personnel costs and subcontracted vendor costs as well as associated overhead expenses plus a monthly fee, and in some cases, annual incentives tied to agreed-upon performance targets, with any penalties typically capped.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P13_S0	Project management services are typically provided on a portfolio-wide or programmatic basis.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P13_S1	Revenues for project management generally include fixed management fees, variable fees, and incentive fees if certain agreed-upon performance targets are met.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P13_S2	Revenues for project management may also include reimbursement of payroll and related costs for personnel providing the services.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	We provide property management services on a contractual basis for owners/investors in office, industrial and retail properties.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P14_S1	These services include construction management, marketing, building engineering, accounting and financial services.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	We typically receive monthly management fees for the property management services we provide based upon a specified percentage of the monthly rental income or rental receipts generated from the property under management, or in certain cases, the greater of such percentage fee or a minimum agreed-upon fee.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	often reimbursed for our administrative and payroll costs, as well as certain out-of-pocket expenses, directly attributable to the properties under management.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P16_S1	Our management agreements with our property management services clients may be terminated by either party with notice generally ranging between 30 to 90 days; however, we have developed long-term relationships with many of these clients and the typical contract continues for multiple years.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P16_S2	We believe our contractual relationships with these clients put us in an advantageous position to provide other services to them, including leasing, refinancing, disposition and appraisal.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P17_S0	Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) Our Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, reporting segment serves clients in approximately 70 countries.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P17_S1	The largest operations are located in France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

1138118_18_ITEM1_P19_S1	Our agreements with these independent affiliates include licenses by us to them to use the CBRE name in the relevant territory in return for payments of annual or quarterly royalty fees to us.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P19_S2	In addition, these agreements typically provide for the cross-referral of business between us and our affiliates.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P19_S3	Revenue from affiliates totaled less than 1% of total revenue in our EMEA segment in 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P20_S0	Asia Pacific Our Asia Pacific reporting segment serves clients in approximately 20 countries.

1138118_18_ITEM1_P23_S1	Favorable currency movement added $5.3 billion to AUM in the current year.

1138118_18_ITEM1_P25_S0	Development Services Operations in our Development Services reporting segment are conducted through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Trammell Crow Company, LLC, which we also refer to as Trammell Crow Company, and certain of its subsidiaries, providing development services primarily in the United States to users of and investors in commercial real estate, as well as for its own account.

1138118_18_ITEM1_P26_S1	Development activity in which Trammell Crow Company has an ownership interest is conducted through subsidiaries that are consolidated or unconsolidated for financial reporting purposes, depending primarily on the extent and nature of our ownership interest.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P26_S2	At December 31, 2017, Trammell Crow Company had $6.8 billion of development projects in process.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P26_S3	Additionally, the inventory of pipeline deals (prospective projects we believe have a greater than 50% chance of closing or where land has been acquired and the projected construction start date is more than twelve months out) was $3.8 billion at December 31, 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P27_S0	Competition We compete across a variety of business lines within the commercial real estate industry, including property management, facilities management, project and transaction management, tenant and landlord leasing, capital markets solutions (property sales, commercial mortgage origination and structured finance) real estate investment management, valuation, loan servicing, development services and proprietary research.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P27_S1	Each business line is highly competitive on an international, national, regional and local level.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P27_S2	Although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2017 revenue, our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographic markets, property types and services.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P27_S3	We face competition from other commercial real estate service providers that compete with us on a global, national, regional or local basis or within a market segment; outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have expanded their offerings from time to time; in-house corporate real estate departments and property owners/developers that self-perform real estate services; investment banking firms, investment managers and developers that compete with us to raise and place investment capital; and accounting/consulting firms that advise on real estate strategies.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P27_S4	Some of these firms may have greater financial resources than we do.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P28_S0	Despite recent consolidation, the commercial real estate services industry remains highly fragmented and competitive.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P28_S1	Although many of our competitors are substantially smaller than we are, some of them are larger on a regional or local basis or have a stronger position in a specific market segment or service offering.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P28_S2	Among our primary competitors are other large national and global firms, such as JLL, Cushman Wakefield, Colliers International Group Inc., Savills plc and Newmark Group, Inc.; market-segment specialists, such as Eastdil Secured, HFF, L.P., Marcus Millichap, Inc. and Walker Dunlop, Inc.; and firms with business lines that compete with our occupier outsourcing business, such as ISS, Sodexo, and ABM.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P29_S0	Seasonality A significant portion of our revenue is seasonal, which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P30_S0	Revenue, earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales, financing and leasing transactions prior to year-end.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P30_S1	At December 31, 2017, excluding our independent affiliates, we had more than 80,000 employees worldwide, approximately 37% of whose costs are fully reimbursed by clients and are mostly in our Occupier Outsourcing and Property Management lines of business.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P30_S2	At December 31, 2017, approximately 1,900 of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements, most of whom work in properties we manage in California, Illinois, New Jersey and New York.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P31_S0	We hold various trademarks and trade names worldwide, which include the CBRE name.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P31_S1	Although we believe our intellectual property plays a role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve, we do not believe we would be materially, adversely affected by expiration or termination of our trademarks or trade names or the loss of any of our other intellectual property rights other than the CBRE and Trammell Crow Company names.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P32_S0	We maintain trademark registrations for the CBRE service mark in jurisdictions where we conduct significant business.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P32_S1	We hold a license to use the Trammell Crow Company trade name pursuant to a license agreement with CF98, L.P., an affiliate of Crow Realty Investors, L.P., d/b/a Crow Holdings, which may be revoked if we fail to satisfy usage and quality control covenants under the license agreement.

1138118_18_ITEM1_P35_S1	Certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability on current or previous real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating, cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property, including contamination resulting from above-ground or underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos or lead at a property.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P35_S2	If contamination occurs or is present during our role as a property or facility manager or developer, we could be held liable for such costs as a current operator of a property, regardless of the legality of the acts or omissions that caused the contamination and without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P35_S3	The operator of a site also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from exposure to hazardous substances or environmental contamination at a site, including liabilities arising from exposure to asbestos-containing materials.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P36_S0	Under certain laws and common law principles, any failure by us to disclose environmental contamination at a property could subject us to liability to a buyer or lessee of the property.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P36_S1	Further, federal, state and local governments in the countries in which we do business have enacted various laws, regulations and treaties governing environmental and climate change, particularly for greenhouse gases, which seek to tax, penalize or limit their release.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P36_S2	Such regulations could lead to increased operational or compliance costs over time.
1138118_18_ITEM1_P37_S0	While we are aware of the presence or the potential presence of regulated substances in the soil or groundwater at or near several properties owned, operated or managed by us that may have resulted from historical or ongoing activities on those properties, we are not aware of any material noncompliance with the environmental laws or regulations currently applicable to us, and we are not the subject of any material claim for liability with respect to contamination at any location.

1138118_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report and other public statements we make.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Based on the information currently known to us, we believe that the matters discussed below identify the material risk factors affecting our business.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P0_S2	However, the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial (but that later become material) may also adversely affect our business.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P0_S4	The success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and, accordingly, our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by economic slowdowns, liquidity crises, fiscal or political uncertainty and possible subsequent downturns in commercial real estate asset values, property sales and leasing activities in one or more of the geographies or industry sectors that we or our clients serve.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P0_S5	Periods of economic weakness or recession, significantly rising interest rates, fiscal or political uncertainty, market volatility, declining employment levels, declining demand for commercial real estate, falling real estate values, disruption to the global capital or credit markets or the public perception that any of these events may occur, may negatively affect the performance of some or all of our business lines.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P0_S6	Our business is significantly affected by generally prevailing economic conditions in the markets where we principally operate, which can result in a general decline in real estate acquisition, disposition and leasing activity, as well as a general decline in the value of commercial real estate and in rents, which in turn reduces revenue from property management fees and commissions derived from property sales, leasing, valuation and financing, as well as revenues associated with development or investment management activities.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P0_S7	Our businesses could also suffer from political or economic disruptions that affect interest rates or liquidity or create financial, market or regulatory uncertainty.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	leave the European Union, and speculation about the terms and consequences of this exit or that of other European Union members has caused and may continue to cause market volatility and currency fluctuations and adversely impact our clients confidence, which may result in a deterioration in our U.K. and other European businesses as leasing and investing activity slow down.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Adverse economic conditions or political or regulatory uncertainty could also lead to a decline in property sales prices as well as a decline in funds invested in existing commercial real estate assets and properties planned for development, which in turn could reduce the commissions and fees that we earn.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P1_S2	In addition, our development and investment strategy often entails making co-investments alongside our investor clients.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P1_S3	During an economic downturn, capital for our investment activities is usually constrained and it may take longer for us to dispose of real estate investments or selling prices may be lower than originally anticipated.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P1_S4	As a result, the value of our commercial real estate investments may be reduced, and we could realize losses or diminished profitability.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P1_S5	In addition, economic downturns may reduce the amount of loan originations and related servicing by our Capital Markets business.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The performance of our Property Management business depends upon how well the properties we manage perform.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	This is because our fees are generally based on a percentage of rent collections from these properties.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Rent collections may be affected by many factors, including: (i) real estate and financial market conditions prevailing generally and locally; (ii) our ability to attract and retain creditworthy tenants, particularly during economic downturns; and (iii) the magnitude of defaults by tenants under their respective leases, which may increase during distressed economic conditions .
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In continental Europe and Asia Pacific, the economies in certain countries can be fragile, which may adversely affect our financial performance.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Economic, political and regulatory uncertainty as well as significant changes and volatility in the financial markets and business environment, and in the global landscape, make it increasingly difficult for us to predict our financial performance into the future.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	As a result, any guidance or outlook that we provide on our performance is based on then-current conditions, and there is a risk that such guidance may turn out to be inaccurate.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Adverse developments in the credit markets may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our Global Investment Management, Development Services and Capital Markets (including property sales and mortgage and structured financing services) businesses are sensitive to credit cost and availability as well as marketplace liquidity.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Additionally, the revenues in all of our businesses are dependent to some extent on the overall volume of activity (and pricing) in the commercial real estate market.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business of providing advisory services to owners, investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with the leasing, disposition and acquisition of property.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	If our clients are unable to procure credit on favorable terms, there may be fewer completed leasing transactions, dispositions and acquisitions of property.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	In addition, if purchasers of commercial real estate are not able to procure favorable financing resulting in the lack of disposition opportunities for our funds and projects, our Global Investment Management and Development Services businesses may be unable to generate incentive fees, and we may also experience losses of co-invested equity capital if the disruption causes a permanent decline in the value of investments made.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Our operations are subject to social, political and economic risks in foreign countries as well as foreign currency volatility.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P6_S4	We conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the United States and as a result, we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	During 2017, approximately 48% of our revenue was transacted in foreign currencies, the majority of which included the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Czech koruna, Danish krone, euro, Hong Kong dollar, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Korean won, Mexican peso, Polish zloty, Singapore dollar, Swedish krona, Swiss franc and Thai baht.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	corresponding fluctuations in our assets under management for our Global Investment Management business, revenue and earnings.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Over time, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P8_S3	For example, the ongoing negotiations with respect to the United Kingdom s referendum to leave the European Union or other changes to the membership or policies of the European Union, or speculation about such events, may cause additional volatility in international currency markets.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P8_S4	In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Additional circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations include, but are not limited to, the following factors:
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	changes in U.S. laws or policies governing foreign trade or investment and use of foreign operations or workers, and any negative sentiments towards the United States as a result of any such changes to laws or policies.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We maintain anti-corruption and anti-money-laundering compliance programs and programs designed to enable us to comply with applicable government economic sanctions, embargoes and other import/export controls throughout the company.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	But, coordinating our activities to deal with the broad range of complex legal and regulatory environments in which we operate presents significant challenges.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	We may not be successful in complying with regulations in all situations and violations may result in criminal or civil sanctions, including material monetary fines, penalties, equitable remedies (including disgorgement), and other costs against us or our employees, and may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P10_S3	We have committed additional resources to expand our worldwide sales and marketing activities, to globalize our service offerings and products in select markets and to develop local sales and support channels.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P10_S4	If we are unable to successfully implement these plans, maintain adequate long-term strategies that successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P10_S5	In addition, we have penetrated, and seek to continue to enter into, emerging markets to further expand our global platform.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P10_S6	However, we may not be successful in effectively evaluating and monitoring the key business, operational, legal and compliance risks specific to those markets.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P10_S7	The political and cultural risks present in emerging countries could also harm our ability to successfully execute our operations or manage our businesses there.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees, including Robert E. Sulentic, our President and Chief Executive Officer.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P11_S2	While certain of our executive officers and key employees are subject to long-term compensatory arrangements from time to time, which include retention incentives and various restrictive covenants, there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain all key members of our senior management.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P11_S3	We also are highly dependent upon the retention of our property sales and leasing professionals, who generate a significant amount of our revenues, as well as other revenue producing professionals.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P11_S4	The departure of any of our key employees, or the loss of a significant number of key revenue producers, if we are unable to quickly hire and integrate qualified replacements, could cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to suffer.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Competition for these personnel is significant and we may not be able to successfully recruit, integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P11_S6	In addition, the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified support personnel in all areas of our business.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P11_S7	We and our competitors use equity incentives and sign-on and retention bonuses to help attract, retain and incentivize key personnel.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P11_S8	As competition is significant for the services of such personnel, the expense of such incentives and bonuses may increase and we may be unable to attract or retain such personnel to the same extent that we have in the past.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P11_S9	Any significant decline in, or failure to grow, our stock price may result in an increased risk of loss of these key personnel.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P11_S10	Furthermore, shareholder influence on our compensation practices, including our ability to issue equity compensation, may decrease our ability to offer attractive compensation to key personnel and make recruiting, retaining and incentivizing such personnel more difficult.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P11_S11	If we are unable to attract and retain these qualified personnel, our growth may be limited and our business and operating results could suffer.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P11_S12	We have numerous local and global competitors across all of our business lines and the geographies that we serve, and further industry consolidation could lead to significant future competition.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P11_S13	We compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate services and investment industry, including property management, facilities management, project and transaction management, tenant and landlord leasing, capital markets solutions (property sales, commercial mortgage origination and structured finance), real estate investment management, valuation, loan servicing, development services and proprietary research.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P11_S14	Although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2017 revenue, our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies, property types and services and business lines.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P11_S15	Depending on the geography, property type or service or business line, we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers and investment firms, including outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have expanded their offerings from time to time, in-house corporate real estate departments, developers, institutional lenders, insurance companies, investment banking firms, investment managers and accounting and consulting firms.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P11_S16	Some of these firms may have greater financial resources allocated to a particular geography, property type or service or business line than we have allocated to that geography, property type, service or business line.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P11_S17	In addition, future changes in laws could lead to the entry of other new competitors, such as financial institutions.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Although many of our existing competitors are local or regional firms that are smaller than we are, some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We are further subject to competition from large national and multi-national firms that have similar service and investment competencies to ours, and it is possible that further industry consolidation could lead to much larger and more formidable competitors globally or in the particular geographies, property types, service or business lines that we serve.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	There is no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively, to maintain current fee levels or margins, or maintain or increase our market share.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Our growth has benefited significantly from acquisitions, which may not perform as expected and similar opportunities may not be available in the future.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	A significant component of our growth over time has been generated by acquisitions.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Any future growth through acquisitions will depend in part upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions, which may not be available to us, as well as sufficient liquidity and credit to fund these acquisitions.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We may incur significant additional debt from time to time to finance any such acquisitions, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our then-existing indebtedness.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Acquisitions involve risks that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired may prove incorrect.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Future acquisitions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transaction-related expenses, which include severance, lease termination, transaction and deferred financing costs, among others.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We have had, and may continue to experience, challenges in integrating operations and information technology systems acquired from other companies.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	This could result in the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of our key employees or clients or those of the acquired operations.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P15_S2	The integration process itself may be disruptive to our business and the acquired company s businesses as it requires coordination of geographically diverse organizations and implementation of new accounting and information technology systems.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We believe that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on operating and net income.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Acquisitions also frequently involve significant costs related to integrating information technology and accounting and management services.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We complete acquisitions with the expectation that they will result in various benefits, including enhanced or more stable revenues, a strengthened market position, cross-selling opportunities, cost synergies, tax benefits and accretion to our adjusted income per share.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Achieving the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions is subject to a number of uncertainties, including the realization of accretive benefits in the timeframe anticipated and whether we can successfully integrate the acquired business.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management s time and energy, which could in turn materially and adversely affect our overall business, financial condition and operating results.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P16_S5	Our joint venture activities and affiliate program involve unique risks that are often outside of our control and that, if realized, could harm our business.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P16_S6	We have utilized joint ventures for commercial investments, select local brokerage and other affiliations both in the United States and internationally, and we may acquire interests in other joint ventures in the future.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Under our affiliate program, we enter into contractual relationships with local brokerage, property management or other operations pursuant to which we license to that operation our name and make available certain of our resources, in exchange for a royalty or economic participation in that operation s revenue, profits or transactional activity.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	In many of these joint ventures and affiliations, we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures or affiliates, and other participants or operators of affiliates may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P17_S2	In addition, the other participants and operators may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P17_S3	If a joint venture participant or affiliate acts contrary to our interest, it could harm our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Our real estate investment and co-investment activities in our Global Investment Management as well as Development Services businesses subject us to real estate investment risks which could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flow.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P17_S5	An important part of the strategy for our Global Investment Management business involves co-investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients, and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P17_S6	As of December 31, 2017, we had committed $38.6 million to fund future co-investments in our Global Investment Management business, $31.9 million of which is expected to be funded during 2018.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P17_S7	In addition to required future capital contributions, some of the co-investment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P17_S8	However, our debt instruments contain restrictions that may limit our ability to provide capital to the entities holding direct or indirect interests in co-investments.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P17_S9	The failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments, including damage to our reputation with our co-investment partners and clients, as well as the necessity of obtaining alternative funding from other sources that may be on disadvantageous terms for us and the other co-investors.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P17_S10	Participating as a co-investor is an important part of our Global Investment Management business, which might suffer if we were unable to make these investments.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P17_S11	Selective investment in real estate projects is an important part of our Development Services business strategy, and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	In addition, at December 31, 2017, we were involved as a principal (in most cases, co-investing with our clients) in approximately 70 unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries with invested equity of $111.8 million and had committed additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries of $20.8 million.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	As of December 31, 2017, we also guaranteed outstanding notes payable of these unconsolidated subsidiaries with outstanding balances of $9.3 million.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	During the ordinary course of our Development Services business, we provide numerous completion and budget guarantees requiring us to complete the relevant project within a specified timeframe and/or within a specified budget, with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	While we generally have guaranteed maximum price contracts with reputable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees (which are intended to pass most of the risk to such contractors), there can be no assurance that we will not have to perform under any such guarantees.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	If we are required to perform under a significant number of such guarantees, it could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Because the disposition of a single significant investment can affect our financial performance in any period, our real estate investment activities could cause fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flow.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	In many cases, we have limited control over the timing of the disposition of these investments and the recognition of any related gain or loss, or incentive participation fee.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Poor performance of the investment programs that our Global Investment Management business manages would cause a decline in our revenue, net income and cash flow and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future programs.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The revenue, net income and cash flow generated by our Global Investment Management business can be volatile period over period, primarily due to the fact that management, transaction and incentive fees can vary as a result of market movements from one period to another.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	In the event that any of the investment programs that our Global Investment Management business manages were to perform poorly, our revenue, net income and cash flow could decline because the value of the assets we manage would decrease, which would result in a reduction in some of our management fees, and our investment returns would decrease, resulting in a reduction in the incentive compensation we earn.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Moreover, we could experience losses on co-investments of our own capital in such programs as a result of poor performance.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Investors and potential investors in our programs continually assess our performance, and our ability to raise capital for existing and future programs and maintaining our current fee structure will depend on our continued satisfactory performance.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Our debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us, and in the event of a default, all of our borrowings would become immediately due and payable.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P21_S5	We have debt and related debt service obligations.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P21_S6	As of December 31, 2017, our total debt, excluding notes payable on real estate (which are generally nonrecourse to us) and warehouse lines of credit (which are recourse only to our wholly-owned subsidiary, CBRE Capital Markets, and are secured by our related warehouse receivables), was approximately $2.0 billion.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P21_S7	For the year ended December 31, 2017, our interest expense was approximately $136.8 million.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P21_S8	Our debt instruments impose, and the terms of any future debt may impose, operating and other restrictions on us and many of our subsidiaries.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P21_S9	These restrictions affect, and in many respects limit or prohibit, our ability to:
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	finance ongoing operations, strategic acquisitions, investments or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest, including:
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our credit agreement currently requires us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) to consolidated interest expense (as defined in the credit agreement) of 2.00x and a maximum leverage ratio of total debt (as defined in the credit agreement) less available cash (as defined in the credit agreement) to consolidated EBITDA of 4.25x (and, in the case of the first four full fiscal quarters following the consummation of a qualified acquisition (as defined in the credit agreement), 4.75x) as of the end of each fiscal quarter.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	On this basis, our coverage ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense was 14.74x for the year ended December 31, 2017, and our leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to consolidated EBITDA was 0.79x as of December 31, 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot give assurance that we will be able to meet those ratios when required.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P23_S3	We continue to monitor our projected compliance with these financial ratios and other terms of our credit agreement.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P23_S4	A breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our debt instruments.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P23_S5	If any such default occurs, the lenders under our credit agreement may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P23_S6	The lenders under our credit agreement also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P23_S7	In addition, a default under our credit agreement could trigger a cross default or cross acceleration under our other debt instruments.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P23_S8	Our credit agreement is jointly and severally guaranteed by us, each of our material U.S. subsidiaries which guarantees any of our other material indebtedness and certain of our foreign subsidiaries.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P23_S9	We have limited restrictions on the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur, which may intensify the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our indebtedness.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P23_S10	In addition, in the event of a credit-ratings downgrade, our ability to borrow and the costs of that borrowing could be adversely affected.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P23_S11	Subject to the maximum amounts of indebtedness permitted by our credit agreement covenants, we are not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur, and so we may in the future incur such indebtedness in order to finance our operations and investments.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P23_S12	In addition, Moody s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard Poor s Ratings Services, rate our significant outstanding debt.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P23_S13	These ratings, and any downgrades of them, may affect our ability to borrow as well as the costs of our current and future borrowings.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P23_S14	A significant portion of our revenue is seasonal, which could cause our financial results to fluctuate significantly.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	A significant portion of our revenue is seasonal.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Historically, our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flow from operating activities tend to be lowest in the first calendar quarter, and highest in the fourth calendar quarter of each year.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales, financing and leasing transactions prior to calendar year-end.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P24_S3	This variance among periods makes it difficult to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P24_S4	In addition, as a result of the seasonal nature of our business, political, economic or other unforeseen disruptions occurring in the fourth quarter that impact our ability to close large transactions may have a disproportionate effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P24_S5	We are subject to various litigation and regulatory risks and may face financial liabilities and/or damage to our reputation as a result of litigation or regulatory proceedings.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our businesses are exposed to various litigation and regulatory risks.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	In addition, although we maintain insurance coverage for most of this risk, insurance coverage is unavailable at commercially reasonable pricing for certain types of exposures.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Accordingly, an adverse result in a litigation against us, or a lawsuit that results in a substantial legal liability for us (and particularly a lawsuit that is not insured), could have a disproportionate and material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Furthermore, an adverse result in regulatory proceedings, if applicable, could result in fines or other liabilities or adversely impact our operations.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	In addition, we depend on our business relationships and our reputation for high-caliber professional services to attract and retain clients.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	As a result, allegations against us, or the announcement of a regulatory investigation involving us, irrespective of the ultimate outcome of that allegation or investigation, may harm our professional reputation and as such materially damage our business and its prospects.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We may be subject to actual or perceived conflicts of interest.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Similar to other global services companies with different business lines and a broad client base, we may be subject to potential actual or perceived conflicts of interests in the provision of our services.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	For example, conflicts may arise from our position as broker to both owners and tenants in commercial real estate lease transactions.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P28_S2	In such situations, our policies are designed to give full disclosure and transparency to all parties as well as implement appropriate barriers on information-sharing and other activities to ensure each party s interests are protected; however, there can be no assurance that our policies will be successful in every case.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P28_S3	If we fail, or appear to fail, to identify, disclose and manage potential conflicts of interest, there could be an adverse effect on our business or reputation regardless of whether any such claims have merit.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P28_S4	In addition, it is possible that in some jurisdictions, regulations could be changed to limit our ability to act for certain parties where potential conflicts may exist.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P28_S5	There can be no assurance that potential conflicts of interest will not adversely affect us.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P28_S6	Failure to maintain and execute information technology strategies and ensure that our employees adapt to changes in technology could materially and adversely affect our ability to remain competitive in the market.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our business relies heavily on information technology to deliver services that meet the needs of our clients.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P29_S1	If we are unable to effectively execute our information technology strategies or adopt new technologies and processes relevant to our service platform, our ability to deliver high-quality services may be materially impaired.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P29_S2	In addition, we make significant investments in new systems and tools to achieve competitive advantages and efficiencies.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Implementation of such investments in information technology could exceed estimated budgets and we may experience challenges that prevent new strategies or technologies from being realized according to anticipated schedules.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P29_S4	If we are unable to maintain current information technology and processes or encounter delays, or fail to exploit new technologies, then the execution of our business plans may be disrupted.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P29_S5	Similarly, our employees require effective tools and techniques to perform functions integral to our business.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P29_S6	Failure to successfully provide such tools and systems, or ensure that employees have properly adopted them, could materially and adversely impact our ability to achieve positive business outcomes.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P29_S7	Failure to maintain the security of our information and technology networks, including personally identifiable and client information, intellectual property and proprietary business information could significantly adversely affect us.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P29_S8	Security breaches and other disruptions of our information and technology networks could compromise our information and intellectual property and expose us to liability, reputational harm and significant remediation costs, which could cause material harm to our business and financial results.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and intellectual property, and that of our clients and personally identifiable information of our employees and contractors, in our data centers and on our networks.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information are critical to our operations.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by third parties or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P30_S3	A significant actual or potential theft, loss, corruption, exposure, fraudulent use or misuse of client, employee or other personally identifiable or proprietary business data, whether by third parties or as a result of employee malfeasance or otherwise, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or intellectual property or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could result in significant remediation and other costs, fines, litigation or regulatory actions against us.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Such an event could additionally disrupt our operations and the services we provide to clients, damage our reputation, result in the loss of a competitive advantage, impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial data and cause a loss of confidence in our services and financial reporting, which could adversely affect our business, revenues, competitive position and investor confidence.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P30_S5	Additionally, we increasingly rely on third-party data storage providers, including cloud storage solution providers, resulting in less direct control over our data.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	compromised security systems, for which we may not be indemnified and which could materially adversely affect us and our reputation.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Interruption or failure of our information technology, communications systems or data services could impair our ability to provide our services effectively, which could damage our reputation and materially harm our operating results.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Our business requires the continued operation of information technology and communication systems and network infrastructure.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Our ability to conduct our global business may be materially adversely affected by disruptions to these systems or our infrastructure.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Our information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or disruption from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, system malfunctions, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and floods, acts of war or terrorism, employee errors or malfeasance, or other events which are beyond our control.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P31_S5	In addition, the operation and maintenance of these systems and networks is in some cases dependent on third-party technologies, systems and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P31_S6	Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays and loss, corruption or exposure of critical data or intellectual property and may also disrupt our ability to provide services to or interact with our clients, and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication or travel.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P31_S7	Furthermore, while we have certain business interruption insurance coverage and various contractual arrangements that can serve to mitigate costs, damages and liabilities, any such event could result in substantial recovery and remediation costs and liability to customers, business partners and other third parties.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P31_S8	We have disaster recovery plans and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events, but our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient and cannot account for all eventualities, and a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations, and as a result, our future operating results could be materially adversely affected.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P31_S9	The infrastructure disruptions we describe above may also disrupt our ability to manage real estate for clients or may adversely affect the value of real estate investments we make on behalf of clients.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The buildings we manage for clients, which include some of the world s largest office properties and retail centers, are used by numerous people daily.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	As a result, fires, earthquakes, floods, other natural disasters, defects and terrorist attacks can result in significant loss of life, and, to the extent we are held to have been negligent in connection with our management of the affected properties, we could incur significant financial liabilities and reputational harm.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our business relies heavily on the use of commercial real estate data.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P33_S1	A portion of this data is purchased or licensed from third-party providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P33_S2	A disruption of our ability to provide data to our professionals and/or our clients or an inadvertent exposure of proprietary data could damage our reputation and competitive position, and our operating results could be adversely affected.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Our goodwill and other intangible assets could become impaired, which may require us to take significant non-cash charges against earnings.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Under current accounting guidelines, we must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P33_S5	Any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of such analysis would result in a non-cash charge against earnings, and such charge could materially adversely affect our reported results of operations, stockholders equity and our stock price.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P33_S6	A significant and sustained decline in our future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the economic environment, slower growth rates or if our stock price falls below our net book value per share for a sustained period, could result in the need to perform additional impairment analysis in future periods.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P33_S7	If we were to conclude that a future write-down of goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary, then we would record such additional charges, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected by new laws or regulations or by changes in existing laws or regulations or the application thereof.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	If we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us, or make incorrect determinations in complex tax regimes, we may incur significant financial penalties.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P34_S2	We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations specific to the services we perform in our business.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions and the provision of property management and valuation services require us and our employees to maintain applicable licenses in each U.S. state and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we perform these services.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P34_S4	If we and our employees fail to maintain our licenses or conduct these activities without a license, or violate any of the regulations covering our licenses, we may be required to pay fines (including treble damages in certain states) or return commissions received or have our licenses suspended or revoked.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P34_S5	A number of our services, including the services provided by our indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, CBRE Capital Markets and CBRE Global Investors, are subject to regulation by the SEC, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, or other self-regulatory organizations and state securities regulators and compliance failures or regulatory action could adversely affect our business.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P34_S6	We could be subject to disciplinary or other actions in the future due to claimed noncompliance with these regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P34_S7	We are also subject to laws of broader applicability, such as tax, securities, environmental and employment laws, including the Fair Labor Standards Act, occupational health and safety regulations and U.S. state wage-and-hour laws.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P34_S8	Failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of significant fines by governmental authorities, awards of damages to private litigants and significant amounts paid in legal fees or settlements of these matters.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We operate in many jurisdictions with complex and varied tax regimes, and are subject to different forms of taxation resulting in a variable effective tax rate.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P35_S1	In addition, from time to time we engage in transactions across different tax jurisdictions.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Due to the different tax laws in the many jurisdictions where we operate, we are often required to make subjective determinations.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	The tax authorities in the various jurisdictions where we carry on business may not agree with the determinations that are made by us with respect to the application of tax law.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Such disagreements could result in disputes and, ultimately, in the payment of additional funds to the government authorities in the jurisdictions where we carry on business, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P36_S3	In addition, changes in tax rules or the outcome of tax assessments and audits could have an adverse effect on our results in any particular quarter.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or Tax Act, that significantly reforms the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P37_S1	The Tax Act, among other things, reduces U.S. corporate tax rates, imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest and net operating losses, allows for expensing of certain capital expenditures, puts into effect the migration from a worldwide system of taxation to a territorial system and imposes a deemed repatriation tax on certain earnings.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate tax rate, the overall impact of the Tax Act is uncertain.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P38_S1	As the size and scope of our business has increased significantly during the past several years, both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with numerous licensing and other regulatory requirements and the possible loss resulting from non-compliance have increased.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P38_S2	The global economic crisis has resulted in increased government and legislative activities, including the introduction of new legislation and changes to rules and regulations, which we expect will continue into the future.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P38_S3	New or revised legislation or regulations applicable to our business, both within and outside of the United States, as well as changes in administrations or enforcement priorities may have an adverse effect on our business, including increasing the costs of regulatory compliance or preventing us from providing certain types of services in certain jurisdictions or in connection with certain transactions or clients.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P38_S4	We are unable to predict how any of these new laws, rules, regulations and proposals will be implemented or in what form, or whether any additional or similar changes to laws or regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, will occur in the future.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P38_S5	Any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We may be subject to environmental liability as a result of our role as a property or facility manager or developer of real estate.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Various laws and regulations impose liability on real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating, cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P40_S1	In our role as a property or facility manager or developer, we could be held liable as an operator for such costs.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P40_S2	This liability may be imposed without regard to the legality of the original actions and without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P40_S3	If we fail to disclose environmental issues, we could also be liable to a buyer or lessee of a property.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P40_S4	If we incur any such liability, our business could suffer significantly as it could be difficult for us to develop or sell such properties, or borrow funds using such properties as collateral.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P40_S5	In the event of a substantial liability, our insurance coverage might be insufficient to pay the full damages, or the scope of available coverage may not cover certain of these liabilities.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P40_S6	Additionally, liabilities incurred to comply with more stringent future environmental requirements could adversely affect any or all of our lines of business.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act.

1138118_18_ITEM1A_P42_S1	These statements also relate to our future prospects, developments and business strategies.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P42_S2	These forward-looking statements are made based on our management s expectations and beliefs concerning future events affecting us and are subject to uncertainties and factors relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P42_S3	These uncertainties and factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those matters expressed in or implied by these forward-looking statements.
1138118_18_ITEM1A_P42_S4	The following factors are among those, but are not only those, that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements:

1138118_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	We occupied the follo wing offices, excluding affiliates, as of December 31, 2017:
1138118_18_ITEM2_P1_S0	Some of our offices house employees from our Global Investment Management and Development Services segments as well as employees from our other business segments.
1138118_18_ITEM2_P1_S1	We have provided above office totals by geographic region rather than by business segment in order to avoid double counting our Global Investment Management and Development Services offices.
1138118_18_ITEM2_P1_S2	In general, these leased offices are fully utilized.
1138118_18_ITEM2_P2_S0	The most significant terms of the leasing arrangements for our offices are the length of the lease and the rent.
1138118_18_ITEM2_P2_S1	Our leases have terms varying in duration.
1138118_18_ITEM2_P2_S2	The rent payable under our office leases varies significantly from location to location as a result of differences in prevailing commercial real estate rates in different geographic locations.
1138118_18_ITEM2_P3_S0	Our management believes that no single office lease is material to our business, results of operations or financial condition.
1138118_18_ITEM2_P3_S1	In addition, we believe there is adequate alternative office space available at acceptable rental rates to meet our needs, although adverse movements in rental rates in some markets may negatively affect our profits in those markets when we enter into new leases.
1138118_18_ITEM2_P3_S2	We do not own any of these offices.
1138118_18_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are a party to a number of pending or threatened lawsuits arising out of, or incident to, our ordinary course of business.
1138118_18_ITEM3_P1_S0	adverse effect on our financial statements if one or more matters are resolved in a particular period in an amount materially in excess of what we anticipated.

1138118_18_ITEM5_P0_S1	The applicable high and low prices of our Class A common stock for the last two fiscal years, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange, are set forth below for the periods indicated.
1138118_18_ITEM5_P1_S0	The closing share price for our Class A common stock on December 31, 2017, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), was $43.31.
1138118_18_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of February 13, 2018, there were 62 stockholders of record of our Class A common stock.
1138118_18_ITEM5_P2_S1	We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on any class of our common stock since our inception on February 20, 2001, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.
1138118_18_ITEM5_P2_S2	We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance future growth and possibly reduce debt or repurchase common stock.
1138118_18_ITEM5_P2_S3	Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, acquisition or other opportunities to invest capital, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors that the board of directors deems relevant .
1138118_18_ITEM5_P3_S0	On January 4, 2017, we issued an aggregate of 495,828 shares of Class A common stock as partial consideration to certain members of senior management in connection with our acquisition of Floored, Inc., a leading producer of SaaS (Software as a Service) solutions, including scalable, interactive 3D graphics technology, for the global commercial real estate industry.
1138118_18_ITEM5_P3_S1	Additionally, as permitted by our director compensation policy, certain of our non-employee directors elected to receive shares of our Class A common stock as consideration for their service as directors in lieu of cash payments during 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM5_P3_S2	Director fees are allocated in quarterly installments, and non-employee directors participating in the stock in lieu of cash program were issued 28 shares on February 15, 2017 in lieu of $1,000 in accrued director fees, 138 shares on May 2, 2017 in lieu of $5,000 in accrued director fees and 3,008 shares on August 1, 2017 in lieu of $113,500 in accrued director fees.
1138118_18_ITEM5_P3_S3	The number of shares issued in each case was based on the closing price on the NYSE of our Class A common stock on the date of issuance.
1138118_18_ITEM5_P3_S4	In each case, the issuance of these securities qualified for an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act because the issuance did not involve a public offering.
1138118_18_ITEM5_P4_S0	Neither we nor any affiliated purchaser as defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) of the Exchange Act purchased any of our Class A common stock during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM5_P4_S1	On October 27, 2017, we announced that our board of directors had authorized the company to repurchase up to an aggregate of $250 million of our Class A common stock over three years.
1138118_18_ITEM5_P4_S2	As of December 31, 2017, the authorization remained unused.

1138118_18_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following table sets forth our selected historical consolidated financial information for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM6_P0_S1	The statement of operations data, the statement of cash flows data and the other data for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 and the balance sheet data as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 were derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
1138118_18_ITEM6_P0_S2	The statement of operations data, the statement of cash flows data and the other data for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the balance sheet data as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were derived from our audited consolidated financial statements that are not included in this Form 10-K.
1138118_18_ITEM6_P1_S0	The selected financial data presented below is not necessarily indicative of results of future operations and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the information included under the headings Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
1138118_18_ITEM6_P2_S0	Note: We have not declared any cash dividends on common stock for the periods shown.
1138118_18_ITEM6_P3_S0	On September 1, 2015, CBRE, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, closed on a Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement with Johnson Controls, Inc. (JCI) to acquire JCI s Global Workplace Solutions (JCI-GWS) business (which we refer to as the GWS Acquisition).
1138118_18_ITEM6_P3_S1	The results for the year ended December 31, 2015 include the operations of JCI-GWS from September 1, 2015, the date such business was acquired.
1138118_18_ITEM6_P4_S0	See Income Per Share information in Note 16 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_18_ITEM6_P5_S0	EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not recognized measurements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP.
1138118_18_ITEM6_P5_S1	When analyzing our operating performance, investors should use these measures in addition to, and not as an alternative for, their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
1138118_18_ITEM6_P5_S2	We generally use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes.
1138118_18_ITEM6_P5_S3	We believe these measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of current results to prior periods and may be useful for investors to analyze our financial performance because they eliminate the impact of selected charges that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of our business.
1138118_18_ITEM6_P5_S4	Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
1138118_18_ITEM6_P6_S0	EBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.
1138118_18_ITEM6_P6_S1	the impact of certain cash and non-cash charges related to acquisitions, cost-elimination expenses and certain carried interest incentive compensation expense (reversal) to align with the timing of associated revenue.
1138118_18_ITEM6_P6_S2	We believe that investors may find these measures useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because their calculations generally eliminate the effects of acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions, the effects of financings and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending.
1138118_18_ITEM6_P7_S0	EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for our discretionary use because they do not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.
1138118_18_ITEM6_P7_S1	These measures may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which amounts are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
1138118_18_ITEM6_P7_S2	We also use adjusted EBITDA as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive compensation programs.
1138118_18_ITEM6_P8_S0	EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_18_ITEM6_P9_S0	Includes depreciation and amortization related to discontinued operations of $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1138118_18_ITEM6_P10_S0	Includes interest expense related to discontinued operations of $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1138118_18_ITEM6_P11_S0	Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes a net charge of $143.4 million attributable to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM6_P11_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2013, includes provision for income taxes related to discontinued operations of $1.3 million.
1138118_18_ITEM6_P12_S0	Includes EBITDA related to discontinued operations of $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1138118_18_ITEM6_P13_S0	In the third quarter of 2015, we elected to early adopt the provisions of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-03, Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.
1138118_18_ITEM6_P13_S1	This ASU required that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability instead of separately being recorded in other assets.
1138118_18_ITEM6_P13_S2	As of December 31, 2014, deferred financing costs totaling $25.6 million were reclassified from other assets and netted against the related debt liabilities to conform with the 2015 presentation.
1138118_18_ITEM6_P13_S3	See Deferred Financing Costs discussion within Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_18_ITEM6_P13_S4	Amounts for 2013 have not been reclassified to conform with the presentation in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	Overview We are the world s largest commercial real estate services and investment firm, based on 2017 revenue, with leading global market positions in our leasing, property sales, occupier outsourcing and valuation businesses.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P0_S1	As of December 31, 2017, we operated in more than 450 offices worldwide with over 80,000 employees, excluding independent affiliates.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P0_S2	Our business is focused on providing services to both the occupiers of real estate and investors in real estate.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P0_S3	For occupiers, we provide facilities management, project management, transaction (both property sales and tenant leasing) and consulting services, among others.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P0_S4	For investors, we provide capital markets (property sales, commercial mortgage brokerage, loan origination and servicing), leasing, investment management, property management, valuation and development services, among others.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P0_S5	We provide commercial real estate services under the CBRE brand name, investment management services under the CBRE Global Investors brand name and development services under the Trammell Crow Company brand name.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P0_S6	We generate revenue from both management fees (large multi-year portfolio and per-project contracts) and commissions on transactions.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P0_S7	In 2017, we generated revenue from a well-balanced, highly diversified base of clients, including more than 90 of the Fortune 100 companies.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P0_S8	We have been an S P 500 company since 2006 and in 2017 we were ranked #214 on the Fortune 500.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P0_S9	We have been voted the most recognized commercial real estate brand in a Lipsey Company survey for 17 years in a row (including 2018).
1138118_18_ITEM7_P0_S10	We have also been rated a World s Most Ethical Company by the Ethisphere Institute for five consecutive years.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that we believe to be reasonable.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P1_S2	Actual results may differ from those estimates.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P1_S3	We believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P1_S4	In order for us to recognize revenue, four basic criteria must be met:
1138118_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our revenue recognition policies are consistent with these criteria.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	The judgments involved in revenue recognition include understanding the complex terms of agreements and determining the appropriate time and method to recognize revenue for each transaction based on such terms.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	Each transaction is evaluated to determine: (i) at what point in time or over what period of time revenue is earned; (ii) whether contingencies exist that impact the timing of recognition of revenue; and (iii) how and when such contingencies will be resolved.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P3_S2	The timing of revenue recognition could vary if different judgments were made.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P3_S3	Our revenues subject to the most judgment are brokerage commission revenue and incentive-based management and development fees.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P3_S4	For a detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policies, see the Revenue Recognition section within Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or this Annual Report.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting, which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P4_S1	The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	value, depreciated replacement cost, market values (where available) and selling prices less costs to dispose.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	We are responsible for determining the valuation of assets and liabilities and for the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	Assumptions must often be made in determining fair values, particularly where observable market values do not exist.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	Assumptions may include discount rates, growth rates, cost of capital, royalty rates, tax rates and remaining useful lives.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P7_S2	These assumptions can have a significant impact on the value of identifiable assets and accordingly can impact the value of goodwill recorded.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P7_S3	Different assumptions could result in different values being attributed to assets and liabilities.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P7_S4	Since these values impact the amount of annual depreciation and amortization expense, different assumptions could also impact our statement of operations and could impact the results of future asset impairment reviews.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	We are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	The goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step process.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	The first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	We use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P10_S2	Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P10_S3	These assumptions include revenue growth rates, profit margin percentages, discount rates, etc.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered to not be impaired.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	The second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one, over the estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P12_S2	Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business s fair value and the relative size of our goodwill, if different assumptions and estimates were used, it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P12_S3	For additional information on goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing, see Notes 2 and 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with the Accounting for Income Taxes , Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, (Topic 740).
1138118_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P14_S2	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	Accounting for tax positions requires judgments, including estimating reserves for potential uncertainties.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	We also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P16_S2	We do not record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that we believe will be realized in future periods.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P16_S3	While we believe the resulting tax balances as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with Topic 740, as applicable, the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code, including, but not limited to:
1138118_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	In December 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act , which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	Our provision for income taxes for 2017 included a net charge of $143.4 million attributable to the Tax Act based upon our best estimate of the impact of the Tax Act in accordance with our understanding of the Tax Act and the related guidance available.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	The changes included in the Tax Act are broad and complex.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	The final transition impacts of the Tax Act may differ from the above estimate due to, among other things, changes in interpretations of the Tax Act, any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the Tax Act, any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the Tax Act, or any updates or changes to estimates we have utilized to calculate the transition impacts, including impacts from changes to current-year earnings estimates and foreign exchange rates of foreign subsidiaries.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P20_S2	Our accounting for the effects of the Tax Act is expected to be completed within the measurement period provided by SAB 118.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P20_S3	Our foreign subsidiaries have accumulated $2.5 billion of undistributed earnings for which we have not recorded a deferred tax liability.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P20_S4	No additional income taxes have been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax, in connection with the enactment of the Tax Act, or any additional outside basis difference inherent in these entities, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P20_S5	Although tax liabilities might result from dividends being paid out of these earnings, or as a result of a sale or liquidation of non-U.S. subsidiaries, these earnings are permanently reinvested outside of the United States and we do not have any plans to repatriate them or to sell or liquidate any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P20_S6	To the extent that we are able to repatriate earnings in a tax efficient manner, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds, net of foreign tax credits.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P20_S7	Determining our tax liability upon repatriation is not practicable.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P20_S8	See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information regarding income taxes.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P20_S9	New Accounting Pronouncements See New Accounting Pronouncements section within Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	Seasonality A significant portion of our revenue is seasonal, which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	Historically, our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flow from operating activities tend to be lowest in the first quarter, and highest in the fourth quarter of each year.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	Revenue, earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales, financing and leasing transactions prior to year-end.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	Inflation Our commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by commercial real estate market supply and demand, which may be affected by inflation.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P23_S1	However, to date, we do not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon our operations.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	When you read our financial statements and the information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should consider that we have experienced, and continue to experience, several material trends and uncertainties that have affected our financial condition and results of operations that make it challenging to predict our future performance based on our historical results.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	We believe that the following material trends and uncertainties are crucial to an understanding of the variability in our historical earnings and cash flows and the potential for continued variability in the future.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	Macroeconomic Conditions Economic trends and government policies affect global and regional commercial real estate markets as well as our operations directly.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	These include: overall economic activity and employment growth; interest rate levels and changes in interest rates; the cost and availability of credit; and the impact of tax and regulatory policies.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P25_S2	Periods of economic weakness or recession, significantly rising interest rates, fiscal uncertainty, declining employment levels, decreasing demand for commercial real estate, falling real estate values, disruption to the global capital or credit markets, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, will negatively affect the performance of our business.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P25_S3	Compensation is our largest expense and our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission and/or bonus basis that correlates with their revenue production.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P25_S4	As a result, the negative effect of difficult market conditions on our operating margins is partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P25_S5	In addition, when negative economic conditions have been particularly severe, we have moved decisively to lower operating expenses to improve financial performance, and then have restored certain expenses as economic conditions improved.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P25_S6	Nevertheless, adverse global and regional economic trends could pose significant risks to the performance of our operations and our financial condition.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	Commercial real estate markets in the United States have generally been marked by increased demand for space, falling vacancies and higher rents since 2010.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	During this time, healthy U.S. property sales activity has been sustained by gradually improving market fundamentals, including higher occupancy rates and rents, broad, low-cost credit availability and increased acceptance of commercial real estate as an institutional asset class.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P26_S2	Following years of strong growth, U.S. property sales volumes slowed in 2016 and 2017, but the market has remained active with significant capital continuing to target commercial real estate.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P26_S3	Commercial mortgage markets also have remained highly active, driven by relatively low interest rates, a favorable lending environment and improved market fundamentals.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P26_S4	The U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises continue to be a significant source of debt capital for multi-family properties.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	European economies began to emerge from recession in 2013, with economic growth accelerating in 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	Sales and leasing activity has improved steadily across most of continental Europe for more than three years and this trend gained momentum in 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P27_S2	Since the United Kingdom s June 2016 referendum to leave the European Union (EU), sentiment in that country has improved, leading to higher property leasing and sales volumes.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P27_S3	However, there continues to be uncertainty about both the withdrawal process and the United Kingdom s future relationship with the EU.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	In Asia Pacific, real estate leasing and investment markets have strengthened broadly since late 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	In 2017, investment activity, in particular, was very strong, and Asia Pacific investors continue to be a significant source of real estate investment both in the region and across other parts of the world.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	Real estate investment management and property development markets have been generally favorable with abundant debt and equity capital flows into commercial real estate.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	Actively managed real estate equity strategies have been pressured by a shift in investor preferences from active to passive portfolio strategies and concerns about potentially higher interest rates.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	The performance of our global real estate services and real estate investment businesses depends on sustained economic growth and job creation; stable, healthy global credit markets; and continued positive business and investor sentiment.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	Effects of Acquisitions We historically have made significant use of strategic acquisitions to add and enhance service competencies around the world.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P31_S1	For example, on September 1, 2015, CBRE, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, pursuant to a Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement with Johnson Controls, Inc. (JCI), acquired JCI s Global Workplace Solutions (JCI-GWS) business (which we refer to as the GWS Acquisition).
1138118_18_ITEM7_P31_S2	The acquired JCI-GWS business was a market-leading provider of integrated facilities management solutions for major occupiers of commercial real estate and had significant operations around the world.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P31_S3	The purchase price was $1.475 billion, paid in cash, plus adjustments totaling $46.5 million for working capital and other items.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P31_S4	We completed the GWS Acquisition in order to advance our strategy of delivering globally integrated services to major occupiers in our Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific segments.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P31_S5	We merged the acquired JCI-GWS business with our existing occupier outsourcing business line, which adopted the Global Workplace Solutions name.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P31_S6	Strategic in-fill acquisitions have also played a key role in strengthening our service offerings.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P31_S7	The companies we acquired have generally been regional or specialty firms that complement our existing platform, or independent affiliates in which, in some cases, we held a small equity interest.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P31_S8	During 2017, we completed 11 in-fill acquisitions, including two leading Software as a Service (SaaS) platforms one that produces scalable interactive visualization technologies for commercial real estate and one that provides technology solutions for facilities management operations, a healthcare-focused project manager in Australia, a full-service brokerage and management boutique in South Florida, a technology-enabled national boutique commercial real estate finance and consulting firm in the United States, a retail consultancy in France, a majority interest in a Toronto-based investment management business specializing in private infrastructure and private equity investments, a San Francisco-based technology-focused boutique real estate brokerage firm, a project management and design engineering firm operating across the United States, a Washington, D.C.-based retail brokerage operation and a leading technical engineering services provider in Italy.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P31_S9	During 2016, we acquired our independent affiliate in Norway, a London-based retail property advisor specializing in the luxury goods retail sector and a leading provider of retail project management, shopping center development and tenant coordination services in the United States.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P31_S10	We also made an equity investment in a property services firm in Malaysia, acquiring a 49% interest.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	We believe that strategic acquisitions can significantly decrease the cost, time and commitment of management resources necessary to attain a meaningful competitive position within targeted markets or to expand our presence within our current markets.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	In general, however, most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating and net income as a result of transaction-related expenditures.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P32_S2	These include severance, lease termination, transaction and deferred financing costs, among others, and the charges and costs of integrating the acquired business and its financial and accounting systems into our own.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P32_S3	Our acquisition structures often include deferred and/or contingent purchase price payments in future periods that are subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P32_S4	As of December 31, 2017, we have accrued deferred consideration totaling $83.6 million, which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	We are monitoring the economic and political developments related to the United Kingdom s referendum to leave the European Union and the potential impact on our businesses in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe, including, in particular, sales and leasing activity in the United Kingdom, as well as any associated currency volatility impact on our results of operations.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	As we continue to increase our international operations through either acquisitions or organic growth, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	Our Global Investment Management business has a significant amount of euro-denominated assets under management, or AUM, as well as associated revenue and earnings in Europe.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P35_S1	In addition, our Global Workplace Solutions business also has a significant amount of its revenue and earnings denominated in foreign currencies, such as the euro and the British pound sterling.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P35_S2	Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have resulted and may continue to result in corresponding fluctuations in our AUM, revenue and earnings.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P35_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 48% of our business was transacted in non-U.S. dollar currencies, the majority of which included the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Czech koruna, Danish krone, euro, Hong Kong dollar, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Korean won, Mexican peso, Polish zloty, Singapore dollar, Swedish krona, Swiss franc and Thai baht.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P35_S4	The following table sets forth our revenue derived from our most significant currencies (U.S. dollars in thousands):
1138118_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	Although we operate globally, we report our results in U.S. dollars.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	As a result, the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar may positively or negatively impact our reported results.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P36_S2	For example, we estimate that had the British pound sterling-to-U.S. dollar exchange rates been 10% higher during the year ended December 31, 2017, the net impact would have been an increase in pre-tax income of $10.9 million.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P36_S3	Had the euro-to-U.S. dollar exchange rates been 10% higher during the year ended December 31, 2017, the net impact would have been an increase in pre-tax income of $12.0 million.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P36_S4	These hypothetical calculations estimate the impact of translating results into U.S. dollars and do not include an estimate of the impact that a 10% change in the U.S. dollar against other currencies would have had on our foreign operations.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	From time to time, we have entered into derivative financial instruments to attempt to protect the value or fix the amount of certain obligations in terms of our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P37_S1	In March 2014, we began a foreign currency exchange forward hedging program by entering into foreign currency exchange forward contracts, including agreements to buy U.S. dollars and sell Australian dollars, British pound sterling, Canadian dollars, euros and Japanese yen.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P37_S2	The purpose of these forward contracts was to attempt to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that would adversely impact some of our foreign currency denominated EBITDA.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P37_S3	Hedge accounting was not elected for any of these contracts.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P37_S4	As such, changes in the fair values of these contracts were recorded directly in earnings.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had no foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding as we made the decision to let our program expire at the end of 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	Included in the consolidated statement of operations set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report were net gains of $7.7 million and $24.2 million from foreign currency exchange forward contracts for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P38_S2	We do not intend to hedge our foreign currency denominated EBITDA in 2018.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	Due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P39_S1	In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P39_S2	Our international operations also are subject to, among other things, political instability and changing regulatory environments, which affects the currency markets and which as a result may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P39_S3	We routinely monitor these risks and related costs and evaluate the appropriate amount of oversight to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	The following table sets forth items derived from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands) :
1138118_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	Certain adjustments have been made to 2016 and 2015 fee revenue to conform with current-year presentation.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	Fee revenue, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not recognized measurements under GAAP.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	When analyzing our operating performance, investors should use these measures in addition to, and not as an alternative for, their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	We believe these measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of current results to prior periods and may be useful for investors to analyze our financial performance because they eliminate the impact of selected charges that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of our business.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P43_S2	Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of fee revenue, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	Fee revenue is gross revenue less both client reimbursed costs largely associated with employees that are dedicated to client facilities and subcontracted vendor work performed for clients.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P44_S1	We believe that investors may find this measure useful to analyze the company s overall financial performance because it excludes costs reimbursable by clients, and as such provides greater visibility into the underlying performance of our business.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	EBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P45_S1	the impact of certain cash and non-cash charges related to acquisitions, cost-elimination expenses and certain carried interest incentive compensation (reversal) expense to align with the timing of associated revenue.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P45_S2	We believe that investors may find these measures useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because their calculations generally eliminate the effects of acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions, the effects of financings and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P45_S3	EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for our discretionary use because they do not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P45_S4	These measures may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which amounts are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P45_S5	We also use adjusted EBITDA as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive compensation programs.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	Represents cost-elimination expenses relating to a program initiated in the fourth quarter of 2015 and completed in the third quarter of 2016 (our cost-elimination project) to reduce the company s global cost structure after several years of significant revenue and related cost growth.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	respectively, of severance costs related to headcount reductions in connection with the program and $4.9 million and $7.8 million, respectively, of third-party contract termination costs.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	The total amount for each period does have a cash impact.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016 We reported consolidated net income of $691.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 on revenue of $14.2 billion as compared to consolidated net income of $572.0 million on revenue of $13.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	Our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $1.1 billion, or 8.7%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P50_S2	The revenue increase reflects strong organic growth fueled by higher occupier outsourcing revenue (up 12.0%) and property management revenue (up 9.0%), increased sales (up 5.4%) and leasing activity (up 7.1%), and higher loan servicing revenue (up 28.9%).
1138118_18_ITEM7_P50_S3	These increases were partially offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $34.5 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily driven by weakness in the British pound sterling and Venezuelan bolivar, partially offset by strength in the euro.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P50_S4	Our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by $769.5 million, or 8.4%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to same period in 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P50_S5	This increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our occupier outsourcing business as well as higher professional bonuses (particularly in the United States and United Kingdom).
1138118_18_ITEM7_P50_S6	In addition, our sales professionals generally are paid on a commission basis, which substantially correlates with our transaction revenue performance.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P50_S7	Accordingly, the increase in sales and lease transaction revenue led to a corresponding increase in commission expense.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P50_S8	These increases were partially offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $37.8 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended December 31, 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P50_S9	In addition, we incurred $37.1 million of costs in the prior year in connection with our cost-elimination project that did not recur in the current year.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P50_S10	Cost of services as a percentage of revenue was relatively consistent at 69.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017 versus 69.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P50_S11	Our operating, administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis increased by $77.4 million, or 2.8%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to same period in 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P50_S12	The increase was mostly driven by higher payroll-related costs (including increases in bonus and stock compensation expense driven by improved operating performance).
1138118_18_ITEM7_P50_S13	This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $96.7 million in integration and other costs related to the GWS Acquisition incurred during the year ended December 31, 2017 as well as the impact of $41.4 million of costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016 as part of our cost-elimination project, which did not recur during the year ended December 31, 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P50_S14	Foreign currency also had a $1.7 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017, including a $0.1 million positive impact from foreign currency translation and $1.6 million of favorable foreign currency transaction activity over the year ended December 31, 2016 (part of which related to net hedging activity during 2016, which did not recur in the current year given that we discontinued our hedging program at the end of 2016).
1138118_18_ITEM7_P50_S15	Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 21.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 20.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily driven by the aforementioned decline in integration and other costs related to the GWS Acquisition as well as the costs associated with our cost-elimination project in 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P50_S16	Our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by $39.2 million, or 10.7%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P50_S17	This increase was primarily attributable to higher amortization expense associated with mortgage servicing rights.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P50_S18	A rise in depreciation expense of $14.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 driven by technology-related capital expenditures also contributed to the increase.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P50_S19	Our equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis increased by $12.9 million, or 6.5%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016, primarily driven by higher equity earnings associated with gains on property sales reported in our Development Services segment.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	Our consolidated interest expense decreased by $8.0 million, or 5.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	This decrease was primarily driven by lower interest expense due to lower net borrowings under our credit agreement and a decrease in notes payable on real estate during 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P51_S2	Our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was $466.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $296.7 million for the same period in 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P51_S3	Our provision for income taxes for 2017 included a provisional net charge of $143.4 million attributable to the Tax Act.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P51_S4	This net charge was primarily comprised of a transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings, net of a tax benefit from the re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities using the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate and the release of valuation allowances on foreign tax credits that will decrease the liability related to the transition tax.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P51_S5	Excluding this net charge, our effective tax rate for 2017, after adjusting pre-tax income to remove the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, would have been 27.9% compared to 34.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P51_S6	We benefited from a more favorable geographic mix of income, the re-measurement of income tax exposures relating to prior periods and release of valuation allowances.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P51_S7	The release of valuation allowances during the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily related to valuation allowances on foreign income tax credits that are expected to be utilized as well as on net operating losses that have been utilized through current year operations.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P51_S8	The re-measurement of income tax exposures, primarily due to the resolution of certain tax audits during the year ended December 31, 2017, contributed to the lower effective tax rate for 2017 as compared to 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P51_S9	In addition, the contribution of income from lower taxed jurisdictions to our total consolidated income for the year ended December 31, 2017, provided a more favorable geographic mix of income, resulting in a decrease to the overall effective tax rate.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2017, the U.S. corporate tax rate was 35%.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P52_S1	For 2018, the U.S. corporate tax rate will decrease to 21%.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015 We reported consolidated net income of $572.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 on revenue of $13.1 billion as compared to consolidated net income of $547.1 million on revenue of $10.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P53_S1	Our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $2.2 billion, or 20.4%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P53_S2	This increase was largely due to contributions from the GWS Acquisition, which added $1.8 billion of revenue, with a full year of activity reflected in 2016 versus only four months of activity in 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P53_S3	Additionally, the revenue increase reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher occupier outsourcing revenue (excluding the impact of the GWS Acquisition, up 14.0%), as well as increased leasing (up 6.7%), commercial mortgage origination (up 18.0%), loan servicing (up 23.3%) and sales (up 1.4%) activity.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P53_S4	These increases were partially offset by lower carried interest revenue in 2016 as well as foreign currency translation, which had a $277.8 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016 versus the same period in 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the British pound sterling.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P53_S5	Our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by $2.0 billion, or 28.8%, during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to same period in 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P53_S6	This increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our occupier outsourcing business, particularly due to the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P53_S7	In addition, as previously mentioned, our sales professionals generally are paid on a commission basis, which substantially correlates with our transaction revenue performance.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P53_S8	Accordingly, the increase in sales and lease transaction revenue led to a corresponding increase in commission expense.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P53_S9	We also incurred $18.9 million of additional costs in 2016 versus 2015 in connection with our cost-elimination project that began in the fourth quarter of 2015 and ended in the third quarter of 2016 to enhance margins and reduce our global cost structure going forward (the expenses of which primarily consisted of severance costs related to headcount reductions and third-party contract termination costs).
1138118_18_ITEM7_P53_S10	These increases were partially offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $205.5 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P53_S11	Cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased from 65.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 69.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016, largely due to the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P53_S12	Excluding activity associated with the acquired JCI-GWS business, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 62.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 64.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P53_S13	This increase was partly driven by the aforementioned increase in costs incurred in connection with our cost-elimination project in 2016 and lower non-commissionable revenue in 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P53_S14	In addition, outsourcing revenue (excluding the impact of the GWS Acquisition), which has a lower margin than sales and lease transaction revenue, was a lower percentage of revenue in 2015 than in 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	Our operating, administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis increased by $147.7 million, or 5.6%, during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P54_S1	The increase was mostly driven by costs associated with the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P54_S2	Also contributing to the variance were higher worldwide payroll-related costs (particularly bonuses largely attributable to improved results, most notably in our Development Services segment).
1138118_18_ITEM7_P54_S3	Lastly, we incurred an additional $19.1 million of costs in 2016 versus 2015 in connection with our cost-elimination project.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P54_S4	These items were partly offset by lower carried interest expense as well as foreign currency, which had a net $46.2 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016, including $10.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency transaction activity over the same period last year, much of which related to hedging activities, that was more than offset by a $57.1 million positive impact from foreign currency translation.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P54_S5	Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 24.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 21.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P54_S6	Excluding activity associated with the acquired JCI-GWS business, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was 25.7% for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 24.7% for the same period in 2016, partly driven by the lower carried interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P54_S7	Our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by $52.8 million, or 16.8%, during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P54_S8	This increase was primarily attributable to higher amortization expense related to intangibles acquired in the GWS Acquisition, with a full year of amortization reflected during the year ended December 31, 2016 versus only four months of amortization during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P54_S9	A rise in depreciation expense of $14.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 driven by technology-related capital expenditures also contributed to the increase.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P54_S10	Our equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis increased by $34.5 million, or 21.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily driven by higher equity earnings associated with gains on property sales reported in our Development Services segment.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P54_S11	Our consolidated interest expense increased by $26.0 million, or 21.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P54_S12	This increase was primarily driven by a full year of interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2016 associated with our $600.0 million of 4.875% senior notes issued in August 2015 as well as higher interest expense associated with borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement dated January 9, 2015 (2015 Credit Agreement) due to an increase in interest rates.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P54_S13	Our write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt on a consolidated basis was $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P54_S14	These costs included the write-off of $1.7 million of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with our prior credit agreement dated March 28, 2013, as amended (2013 Credit Agreement), and $1.0 million of fees incurred in connection with our 2015 Credit Agreement.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P54_S15	Our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was $296.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $320.9 million for the same period in 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P54_S16	Our effective tax rate, after adjusting pre-tax income to remove the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, decreased to 34.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 37.0% for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P54_S17	We experienced a favorable change in earnings mix in the current year, with 60% of our earnings, after removing the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, from the United States for 2016 versus 68% for 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P54_S18	In addition, we realized certain discrete tax benefits during the year ended December 31, 2016 that were not applicable in 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P54_S19	These items were offset, in part, by higher losses sustained during the year ended December 31, 2016 in jurisdictions where no tax benefit could be provided.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	We report our operations through the following segments: (1) Americas, (2) EMEA, (3) Asia Pacific, (4) Global Investment Management, and (5) Development Services.

1138118_18_ITEM7_P61_S1	The revenue increase reflects strong organic growth fueled by higher occupier outsourcing and property management revenue, improved leasing activity and higher loan servicing revenue.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	Foreign currency translation had an $8.8 million negative impact on revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily driven by weakness in the Venezuelan bolivar, partially offset by strength in the Brazilian real and the Canadian dollar.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P62_S1	Cost of services increased by $427.2 million, or 8.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to higher costs associated with our occupier outsourcing business and higher professional bonuses in the United States.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P62_S2	Also contributing to the variance was higher commission expense resulting from improved lease transaction revenue.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P62_S3	Foreign currency translation had an $8.8 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended December 31, 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P62_S4	These items were partially offset by the impact of $11.9 million of costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016 in connection with our cost-elimination project that did not recur during the year ended December 31, 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P62_S5	Cost of services as a percentage of revenue was consistent at 69.7% for both years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P62_S6	Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $47.6 million, or 3.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P62_S7	The increase was partly driven by higher payroll-related costs (including increases in bonus and stock compensation expense due to improved operating performance).
1138118_18_ITEM7_P62_S8	Foreign currency also had a $9.0 million negative impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017, which included a negative impact from foreign currency translation of $2.4 million and $6.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency transaction activity over the year ended December 31, 2016 (part of which related to net hedging activity in 2016, which did not recur in the current year).
1138118_18_ITEM7_P62_S9	These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $52.6 million in integration and other costs related to the GWS Acquisition incurred during the year ended December 31, 2017 as well as the impact of $10.4 million of costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016 as part of our cost-elimination project, which did not recur during the year ended December 31, 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	In connection with the origination and sale of mortgage loans for which the company retains servicing rights, we record servicing assets or liabilities based on the fair value of the retained mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) on the date the loans are sold.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P63_S1	Upon origination of a mortgage loan held for sale, the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights to be retained is included in the forecasted proceeds from the anticipated loan sale and results in a net gain (which is reflected in revenue).
1138118_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	Subsequent to the initial recording, MSRs are amortized (within amortization expense) and carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value in other intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P64_S1	They are amortized in proportion to and over the estimated period that the servicing income is expected to be received.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P64_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2017, MSRs contributed to operating income $145.1 million of gains recognized in conjunction with the origination and sale of mortgage loans, offset by $98.6 million of amortization of related intangible assets.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P64_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2016, MSRs contributed to operating income $154.0 million of gains recognized in conjunction with the origination and sale of mortgage loans, offset by $73.3 million of amortization of related intangible assets.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P64_S4	EMEA Revenue increased by $280.2 million, or 7.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P64_S5	We achieved strong organic growth fueled by higher occupier outsourcing and property management revenue, as well as higher sales and leasing activity.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P64_S6	Such growth was partially offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $35.0 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily driven by weakness in the British pound sterling, partially offset by strength in the euro.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	Cost of services increased by $179.1 million, or 6.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to higher costs associated with our occupier outsourcing business and higher professional bonuses, particularly in the United Kingdom resulting from improved operating performance.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P65_S1	These items were partly offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $36.9 million positive impact on cost of services.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P65_S2	In addition, we incurred $18.8 million of costs during the year ended December 31, 2016 in connection with our cost-elimination project that did not recur during the year ended December 31, 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P65_S3	The absence of such costs contributed to cost of services as a percentage of revenue decreasing from 77.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 76.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P65_S4	Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $3.4 million, or 0.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P65_S5	This increase was primarily driven by higher payroll-related costs, including increased bonus and stock compensation expense due to improved operating performance during the year ended December 31, 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P65_S6	These items were largely offset by a decrease of $38.1 million in integration and other costs related to the GWS Acquisition incurred during the year ended December 31, 2017 as well as the impact of $6.8 million of costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016 as part of our cost-elimination project, which did not recur during the year ended December 31, 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P65_S7	Foreign currency also had a $1.3 million net positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017, including a $3.6 million positive impact from foreign currency translation, partially offset by $2.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency transaction activity over the year ended December 31, 2016 (part of which related to net hedging activity in 2016, which did not recur in the current year).
1138118_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	Asia Pacific Revenue increased by $230.0 million, or 15.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P66_S1	The revenue increase reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher occupier outsourcing and property management revenue as well as improved sales and leasing activity.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P66_S2	In addition, foreign currency translation had a $10.9 million positive impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily driven by strength in the Australian dollar and Indian rupee, partially offset by weakness in the Chinese yuan and Japanese yen.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P66_S3	Cost of services increased by $163.2 million, or 15.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016, driven by higher costs associated with our occupier outsourcing business.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P66_S4	Also contributing to the variance was higher commission expense resulting from improved sales and lease transaction revenue.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P66_S5	In addition, foreign currency translation had a $7.9 million negative impact on cost of services during the year ended December 31, 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P66_S6	These items were partially offset by the impact of $6.4 million of costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016 in connection with our cost-elimination project that did not recur during the year ended December 31, 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P66_S7	Cost of services as a percentage of revenue was relatively consistent at 71.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017 versus 71.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016.

1138118_18_ITEM7_P66_S9	We incurred higher payroll-related costs (including increased stock compensation and bonus expense due to improved operating performance) during the year ended December 31, 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P66_S10	This was partially offset by a decrease of $6.0 million in integration and other costs related to the GWS Acquisition incurred during the year ended December 31, 2017 as well as the impact of $2.9 million of costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016 as part of our cost-elimination project, which did not recur during the year ended December 31, 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P66_S11	Foreign currency activity also had an overall net positive impact of $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, due to $11.1 million of favorable foreign currency transaction activity over the year ended December 31, 2016 (part of which related to net hedging activity in 2016, which did not recur in the current year), partially offset by a $1.8 million negative impact from foreign currency translation.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P66_S12	Global Investment Management Revenue increased by $7.8 million, or 2.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily driven by higher carried interest revenue.

1138118_18_ITEM7_P67_S3	A roll forward of our AUM by product type for the year ended December 31, 2017 is as follows (dollars in billions):
1138118_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	AUM generally refers to the properties and other assets with respect to which we provide (or participate in) oversight, investment management services and other advice, and which generally consist of real estate properties or loans, securities portfolios and investments in operating companies and joint ventures.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P68_S1	Our AUM is intended principally to reflect the extent of our presence in the real estate market, not the basis for determining our management fees.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P68_S2	Our assets under management consist of:
1138118_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	the total fair market value of the real estate properties and other assets either wholly-owned or held by joint ventures and other entities in which our sponsored funds or investment vehicles and client accounts have invested or to which they have provided financing.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P69_S1	Committed (but unfunded) capital from investors in our sponsored funds is not included in this component of our AUM.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P69_S2	The value of development properties is included at estimated completion cost.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	the net asset value of our managed securities portfolios, including investments (which may be comprised of committed but uncalled capital) in private real estate funds under our fund of funds investments.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	Our calculation of AUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	Development Services Revenue increased by $6.2 million, or 8.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily driven by higher management and development fees during the year ended December 31, 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P72_S1	Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $20.1 million, or 14.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P72_S2	This increase was primarily driven by higher payroll-related costs, including increased bonus expense during the year ended December 31, 2017 due to improved operating performance (property sales reflected in equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries and gain on disposition of real estate were significantly higher during the year ended December 31, 2017).
1138118_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	As of December 31, 2017, development projects in process totaled $6.8 billion, up $0.2 billion from year-end 2016.

1138118_18_ITEM7_P74_S1	This increase was in part due to contributions from the GWS Acquisition, which added $641.6 million of revenue, with a full year of activity reflected during the year ended December 31, 2016 versus only four months of activity in 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P74_S2	Additionally, the revenue increase reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher occupier outsourcing revenue (excluding the impact of the GWS Acquisition, up 10.4%), as well as improved leasing and commercial mortgage origination and loan servicing activity.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	Foreign currency translation had a $30.6 million negative impact on revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016 versus the same period in 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P75_S1	Cost of services increased by $922.9 million, or 22.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to higher costs associated with our occupier outsourcing business, particularly due to the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P75_S2	Also contributing to the variance was higher commission expense resulting from improved lease transaction revenue.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P75_S3	We also incurred $10.3 million of additional costs in 2016 versus 2015 in connection with our cost-elimination project.

1138118_18_ITEM7_P75_S6	Excluding activity associated with the acquired JCI-GWS business, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 66.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 65.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015, partly driven by the aforementioned costs associated with our cost-elimination project.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P75_S7	Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $80.4 million, or 6.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P75_S8	The increase was partly driven by costs associated with the GWS Acquisition as well as higher payroll-related costs, including an increase in 401(k) contributions in the United States.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P75_S9	Higher software license and maintenance contract costs also contributed to the increase.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P75_S10	Foreign currency had a net $4.5 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016, which included a positive impact from foreign currency translation of $6.2 million, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency transaction activity, mostly hedging related, of $1.7 million.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P75_S11	For the year ended December 31, 2016, MSRs contributed to operating income $154.0 million of gains recognized in conjunction with the origination and sale of mortgage loans, offset by $73.3 million of amortization of related intangible assets.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P75_S12	For the year ended December 31, 2015, MSRs contributed to operating income $110.4 million of gains recognized in conjunction with the origination and sale of mortgage loans, offset by $59.3 million of amortization of related intangible assets.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P75_S13	EMEA Revenue increased by $900.3 million, or 30.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P75_S14	This increase was largely due to contributions from the GWS Acquisition, which added $924.9 million of revenue, with a full year of activity reflected during the year ended December 31, 2016 versus only four months of activity in 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P75_S15	In addition, the revenue increase also reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher occupier outsourcing revenue (excluding the impact of the GWS Acquisition, up 15.8%).
1138118_18_ITEM7_P75_S16	Leasing activity was up slightly and sales activity was flat during the year ended December 31, 2016 versus the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	Foreign currency translation had a $232.5 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016 versus the same period in 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the British pound sterling.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P76_S1	Cost of services increased by $813.5 million, or 37.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P76_S2	This increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our occupier outsourcing business, particularly due to the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P76_S3	We also incurred $9.3 million of additional costs in 2016 versus 2015 in connection with our cost-elimination project.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P76_S4	These increases were partially reduced by foreign currency translation, which had a $177.8 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P76_S5	Cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased to 77.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 73.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015, largely due to the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P76_S6	Excluding activity associated with the acquired JCI-GWS business, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 69.0% for both the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P77_S0	Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $71.5 million, or 11.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily driven by higher costs associated with the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P77_S1	Higher payroll-related costs (including bonuses) during the year ended December 31, 2016 also contributed to the variance.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P77_S2	These increases were partially mitigated by foreign currency, which had a $44.2 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016, including $1.0 million in favorable foreign currency transaction activity over the same period in 2015, much of which related to hedging activities, and a $43.2 million positive impact from foreign currency translation.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P78_S0	Asia Pacific Revenue increased by $355.8 million, or 31.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P78_S1	This increase was largely due to contributions from the GWS Acquisition, which added $229.4 million of revenue, with a full year of activity reflected during the year ended December 31, 2016 versus only four months of activity in 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P78_S2	The revenue increase also reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher occupier outsourcing revenue (excluding the impact of the GWS Acquisition, up 33.4%) as well as improved sales and leasing activity.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P78_S3	This increase was partially offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $2.9 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016 versus the same period in 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the Chinese yuan and Indian rupee, largely mitigated by strength in the Japanese yen.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P78_S4	Cost of services increased by $304.4 million, or 39.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, driven by higher costs associated with our occupier outsourcing businesses, including the acquired GWS business.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P78_S5	This was partially offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $5.9 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P78_S6	Cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased to 71.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 67.1% for the same period in 2015, primarily due to the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P78_S7	Excluding activity associated with the acquired JCI-GWS business, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 65.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 64.1% for the same period in 2015, primarily driven by our revenue mix, with outsourcing revenue, which has a lower margin than sales and lease revenue, being a higher percentage of revenue than in the prior year.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P78_S8	Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $25.0 million, or 9.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, mainly driven by costs associated with the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P78_S9	Additionally, foreign currency activity had an overall negative impact of $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, due to unfavorable foreign currency transaction activity, mostly related to hedging.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P78_S10	Global Investment Management Revenue decreased by $90.9 million, or 19.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P78_S11	This decrease was primarily driven by lower carried interest revenue as well as lower acquisition, asset management and incentive fees during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	Foreign currency translation had an $11.8 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016 versus the same period in 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the British pound sterling.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P79_S1	Operating, administrative and other expenses decreased by $50.8 million, or 14.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily driven by lower carried interest expense incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P79_S2	Additionally, foreign currency had a net $5.0 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016, which included $2.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency transaction activity over the same period in 2015, much of which related to hedging activities, that was more than offset by a $7.7 million positive impact from foreign currency translation.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P79_S3	These decreases were partially offset by $19.8 million of additional costs in 2016 versus 2015 in connection with our cost-elimination project.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	A roll forward of our AUM by product type for the year ended December 31, 2016 is as follows (dollars in billions):
1138118_18_ITEM7_P81_S0	Development Services Revenue increased by $5.8 million, or 8.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily driven by higher development fees during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P81_S1	Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $21.6 million, or 18.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P81_S2	This increase was primarily driven by higher bonuses during the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of significantly improved operating performance due to property sales (reflected in equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries and gain on disposition of real estate).
1138118_18_ITEM7_P82_S0	As of December 31, 2016, development projects in process totaled $6.6 billion, down $0.1 billion from year-end 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P82_S1	The new projects pipeline totaled $4.2 billion at December 31, 2016, up $0.6 billion from year-end 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P83_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that we can satisfy our working capital and funding requirements with internally generated cash flow and, as necessary, borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P83_S1	Our expected capital requirements for 2018 include up to approximately $180 million of anticipated capital expenditures, net of tenant concessions.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P83_S2	As of December 31, 2017, we had aggregate commitments of $38.6 million to fund future co-investments in our Global Investment Management business, $31.9 million of which is expected to be funded in 2018.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P83_S3	Additionally, as of December 31, 2017, we are committed to fund $20.8 million of additional capital to unconsolidated subsidiaries within our Development Services business, which we may be required to fund at any time.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P83_S4	As of December 31, 2017, we had $2.8 billion of borrowings available under our $2.8 billion revolving credit facility.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P83_S5	We have historically relied on our internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital, capital expenditure and general investment requirements (including strategic in-fill acquisitions) and have not sought other external sources of financing to help fund these requirements.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P83_S6	In the absence of extraordinary events or a large strategic acquisition, we anticipate that our cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future, and at a minimum for the next 12 months.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P83_S7	We may seek to take advantage of market opportunities to refinance existing debt instruments, as we have done in the past, with new debt instruments at interest rates, maturities and terms we deem attractive.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P83_S8	We may also, from time to time in our sole discretion, purchase, redeem, or retire our existing senior notes, through tender offers, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, or otherwise.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P83_S9	In February 2018, we gave the notice required under the indenture governing our 5.00% senior notes of our intent to redeem such notes in full on March 15, 2018.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P83_S10	We intend to fund this redemption with $550.0 million of borrowings from our tranche A term loan facility and borrowings from our revolving credit facility under our credit agreement as well as with cash on hand.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P84_S0	As noted above, we believe that any future significant acquisitions that we may make could require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P84_S1	In the past, we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that we believed to be reasonable.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P84_S2	However, it is possible that we may not be able to obtain acquisition financing on favorable terms, or at all, in the future if we decide to make any further significant acquisitions.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P85_S0	Our long-term liquidity needs, other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases, are generally comprised of two elements.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P86_S0	The first is the repayment of the outstanding and anticipated principal amounts of our long-term indebtedness.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P86_S1	We are unable to project with certainty whether our long-term cash flow from operations will be sufficient to repay our long-term debt when it comes due.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P86_S2	If our cash flow is insufficient, then we expect that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P86_S3	We cannot make any assurances that such refinancing or amendments would be available on attractive terms, if at all.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P87_S0	The second long-term liquidity need is the payment of obligations related to acquisitions.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P87_S1	Our acquisition structures often include deferred and/or contingent purchase price payments in future periods that are subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P87_S2	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had accrued $83.6 million ($23.2 million of which was a current liability) and $91.0 million ($29.3 million of which was a current liability), respectively, of deferred purchase consideration, which was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P87_S3	In addition, on October 27, 2016, we announced that our board of directors had authorized the company to repurchase up to an aggregate of $250 million of our Class A common stock over three years.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P87_S4	The timing of the repurchase and the actual amount repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of our common stock, general market and economic conditions and other factors.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P87_S5	We intend to fund the repurchases, if any, with cash on hand or borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P87_S6	As of December 31, 2017, the authorization remained unused.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P87_S7	Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $710.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $260.2 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P87_S8	The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to improved operating performance and lower net payments to vendors.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P87_S9	These items were partially offset by higher net receivables recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P87_S10	Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $450.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $201.6 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P87_S11	The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher net payments to vendors and income taxes paid during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P87_S12	These items were partially offset by higher commissions paid during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P88_S0	Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $141.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $134.0 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P88_S1	The increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by a greater amount invested in in-fill acquisitions during the current year.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P88_S2	Net cash used in investing activities totaled $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $1.6 billion as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P88_S3	This variance was primarily driven by a greater amount invested in acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2015, particularly the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P88_S4	Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $603.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $404.1 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P88_S5	The increase was primarily due to higher net repayments of senior term loans during the year ended December 31, 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P89_S0	Net cash used in financing activities totaled $199.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $789.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P89_S1	This variance was primarily due to proceeds received from the issuance of $600.0 million of 4.875% senior notes in August 2015 as well as $378.8 million of higher net borrowings of term loans under our 2015 Credit Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P89_S2	These collective borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2015, as well as cash on hand, were used to fund the GWS Acquisition, which closed on September 1, 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P89_S3	The following is a summary of our various contractual obligations and other commitments as of December 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands):
1138118_18_ITEM7_P90_S0	Reflects gross outstanding long-term debt balances as of December 31, 2017, assumed to be paid at maturity, excluding unamortized discount, premium and deferred financing costs.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P90_S1	See Note 11 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P90_S2	Figures do not include scheduled interest payments.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P90_S3	Assuming each debt obligation is held until maturity, we estimate that we will make the following interest payments (dollars in thousands): 2018 $96,584; 2019 to 2020 $193,168; 2021 to 2022 $192,329 and thereafter $149,818.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P91_S0	In February 2018, we gave the notice required under the indenture governing our 5.00% senior notes of our intent to redeem such notes in full on March 15, 2018.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P91_S1	We intend to fund this redemption with $550.0 million of borrowings from our tranche A term loan facility and borrowings from our revolving credit facility under our credit agreement as well as with cash on hand.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P91_S2	Overall, these transactions will reduce the estimated future interest payments detailed in footnote (1).
1138118_18_ITEM7_P92_S0	Primarily represents our warehouse lines of credit, which are recourse only to our wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE Capital Markets, Inc. (CBRE Capital Markets) and are secured by our related warehouse receivables.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P92_S1	See Notes 4 and 11 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P93_S0	See Note 12 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P94_S0	See Note 13 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P94_S1	These obligations are related, either wholly or partially, to the future retirement of our employees and such retirement dates are not predictable.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P94_S2	An undeterminable portion of this amount will be paid in years one through five.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P95_S0	Represents deferred obligations related to previous acquisitions, which are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2017 set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P96_S0	Due to the nature of guarantees, payments could be due at any time upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, including default.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P96_S1	Accordingly, all guarantees are reflected as expiring in less than one year.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P97_S0	Includes $38.6 million related to our Global Investment Management segment, $31.9 million of which is expected to be funded in 2018, and $20.8 million related to our Development Services segment (callable at any time).
1138118_18_ITEM7_P98_S0	As of December 31, 2017, our current and non-current tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, totaled $23.8 million.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P98_S1	Of this amount, we can reasonably estimate that $0.8 million will require cash settlement in less than one year.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P98_S2	We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions for the remaining $23.0 million.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P98_S3	In addition, we recognized an estimated tax liability of $134.6 million related to the transition tax on mandatory deemed repatriation due to the Tax Act, net of $55.4 million of foreign income tax credit carryforwards used to reduce the liability.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P98_S4	The estimated state tax liability and a portion of the estimated federal tax liability totaling $16.7 million is payable in less than one year.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P98_S5	The remainder of the federal tax liability of $117.9 million is payable over the following seven years with no interest charged.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P99_S0	Represents outstanding reserves for claims under certain insurance programs, which are included in other current and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2017 set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P99_S1	Due to the nature of this item, payments could be due at any time upon the occurrence of certain events.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P99_S2	Accordingly, the entire balance has been reflected as expiring in less than one year.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P100_S0	Indebtedness Our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to pay the principal amount of our indebtedness and other obligations when due.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P100_S1	In addition, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or for other purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P100_S2	If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our debt, would increase.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P101_S0	Long-Term Debt We maintain credit facilities with third-party lenders, which we use for a variety of purposes.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P102_S0	On March 28, 2013, CBRE Services, Inc. (CBRE Services), our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into the 2013 Credit Agreement with a syndicate of banks led by Credit Suisse AG, or CS, as administrative and collateral agent, to completely refinance a previous credit agreement.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P102_S1	On January 9, 2015, CBRE Services entered into the 2015 Credit Agreement with a syndicate of banks jointly led by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner Smith Incorporated, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and CS.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P102_S2	In January 2015, we used the proceeds from the tranche A term loan facility under the 2015 Credit Agreement and from the December 2014 issuance of $125.0 million of 5.25% senior notes due 2025, along with cash on hand, to pay off the prior tranche A and tranche B term loans and the balance on our revolving credit facility under the 2013 Credit Agreement.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P103_S0	On September 3, 2015, CBRE Services entered into an incremental assumption agreement with a syndicate of banks jointly led by Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and CS to establish new tranche B-1 and tranche B-2 term loan facilities under the 2015 Credit Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P103_S1	On March 21, 2016, CBRE Services executed an amendment to the 2015 Credit Agreement that, among other things, extended the maturity on the revolving credit facility to March 2021 and increased the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility by $200.0 million.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P103_S2	On October 31, 2017, we entered into a new Credit Agreement (the 2017 Credit Agreement), which refinanced and replaced the 2015 Credit Agreement.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P103_S3	We used $200.0 million of borrowings from the tranche A term loan facility and $83.0 million of revolving credit facility borrowings under the 2017 Credit Agreement, in addition to cash on hand, to repay all amounts outstanding under the 2015 Credit Agreement.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P104_S0	The 2017 Credit Agreement is a senior unsecured credit facility that is jointly and severally guaranteed by us and certain of our subsidiaries.

1138118_18_ITEM7_P109_S0	Interest Rate Swap Agreements In March 2011, we entered into five interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of $400.0 million, all with effective dates in October 2011, and immediately designated them as cash flow hedges in accordance with the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 815).
1138118_18_ITEM7_P109_S1	The purpose of these interest rate swap agreements is to attempt to hedge potential changes to our cash flows due to the variable interest nature of our senior term loan facilities.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P109_S2	A notional amount of $200.0 million of these interest rate swap agreements expired on October 2, 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P109_S3	The remaining total notional amount of these interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2017 was $200.0 million, which expire in September 2019.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P109_S4	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the fair values of such interest rate swap agreements were reflected as a $4.8 million liability and a $13.2 million liability, respectively, and were included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P110_S0	In July 2015, we entered into three interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $300.0 million, all with effective dates in August 2015, and designated them as cash flow hedges in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P110_S1	In August 2015, we elected to terminate these agreements and paid a $6.2 million cash settlement, which has been recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
1138118_18_ITEM7_P110_S2	This settlement fee is being amortized to interest expense throughout the remaining term of the terminated hedge transaction until August 2025.
1138118_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our exposure to market risk primarily consists of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations and changes in interest rates on debt obligations.
1138118_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We manage such risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of our debt funding and by using derivative financial instruments.
1138118_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We apply the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) (Topic 815) when accounting for derivative financial instruments.
1138118_18_ITEM7A_P1_S1	In all cases, we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and, accordingly, do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
1138118_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Exchange Rates Our foreign operations expose us to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
1138118_18_ITEM7A_P2_S1	These fluctuations may impact the value of our cash receipts and payments in terms of our functional (reporting) currency, which is U.S. dollars.
1138118_18_ITEM7A_P2_S2	See the discussion of international operations, which is included in Item 7.

1138118_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Interest Rates We manage our interest expense by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt.
1138118_18_ITEM7A_P3_S1	We enter into interest rate swap agreements to attempt to hedge the variability of future interest payments due to changes in interest rates.

1138118_18_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The estimated fair value of our senior term loans was approximately $199.9 million at December 31, 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM7A_P4_S1	Based on dealers quotes, the estimated fair values of our 5.00% senior notes, 4.875% senior notes and 5.25% senior notes were $823.8 million, $645.7 million and $468.0 million, respectively, at December 31, 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM7A_P4_S2	As of December 31, 2017, our outstanding gross variable rate debt was $200.0 million and we had interest rate swap agreements in place for a like amount in order to hedge the variability of future interest payments due.
1138118_18_ITEM7A_P4_S3	As such, we have not utilized sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect of a rise in interest rates on our variable rate debt as the impact would be minimal.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	All other schedules are omitted because they are either not applicable, not required or the information required is included in the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes thereto.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CBRE Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes and financial statement schedule II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements ).
1138118_18_ITEM8_P1_S1	We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P1_S2	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P1_S3	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P1_S4	Basis for Opinion The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting .
1138118_18_ITEM8_P1_S5	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P1_S6	( PCAOB ) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P1_S7	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P1_S8	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P1_S9	Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P1_S10	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P1_S11	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P1_S12	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P1_S13	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P1_S14	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P2_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P2_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P2_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P2_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P3_S0	We have served as the Company s auditor since 2008.

1138118_18_ITEM8_P11_S0	CBRE Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (which may be referred to in these financial statements as the company , we , us and our ), was incorporated on February 20, 2001.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P11_S1	We are the world s largest commercial real estate services and investment firm, based on 2017 revenue, with leading global market positions in our leasing, property sales, occupier outsourcing and valuation businesses.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P11_S2	Our business is focused on providing services to both occupiers of real estate and investors in real estate.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P11_S3	For occupiers, we provide facilities management, project management, transaction (both property sales and tenant leasing) and consulting services, among others.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P11_S4	For investors, we provide capital markets (property sales, commercial mortgage brokerage, loan origination and servicing), leasing, investment management, property management, valuation and development services, among others.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P11_S5	We generate revenue from both management fees (large multi-year portfolio and per-project contracts) and commissions on transactions.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P11_S6	As of December 31, 2017, we operated in more than 450 offices worldwide with over 80,000 employees, excluding independent affiliates, providing commercial real estate services under the CBRE brand name, investment management services under the CBRE Global Investors brand name and development services under the Trammell Crow Company brand name.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P12_S0	Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our consolidated subsidiaries, which are comprised of variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary and voting interest entities, in which we determined we have a controlling financial interest, under the Consolidations Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) (Topic 810).
1138118_18_ITEM8_P12_S1	The equity attributable to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries is shown separately in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P12_S2	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P13_S0	We determine whether an entity is a VIE and, if so, whether it should be consolidated by utilizing judgments and estimates that are inherently subjective.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P13_S1	Our determination of whether an entity in which we hold a direct or indirect variable interest is a VIE is based on several factors, including whether the entity s total equity investment at risk upon inception is sufficient to finance the entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P13_S2	We make judgments regarding the sufficiency of the equity at risk based first on a qualitative analysis, and then a quantitative analysis, if necessary.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P14_S0	We analyze any investments in VIEs to determine if we are the primary beneficiary.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P14_S1	In evaluating whether we are the primary beneficiary, we evaluate our direct and indirect economic interests in the entity.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P14_S2	A reporting entity is determined to be the primary beneficiary if it holds a controlling financial interest in the VIE.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P14_S3	(2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from such entity that could potentially be significant to such entity.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P14_S4	Performance of that analysis requires the exercise of judgment.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P14_S5	We consider a variety of factors in identifying the entity that holds the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance including, but not limited to, the ability to direct financing, leasing, construction and other operating decisions and activities.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P14_S6	In addition, we consider the rights of other investors to participate in those decisions, to replace the manager and to sell or liquidate the entity.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P14_S7	We determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE at the time we become involved with a variable interest entity and reconsider that conclusion continually.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P15_S0	We consolidate any VIE of which we are the primary beneficiary and disclose significant VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary, if any, as well as disclose our maximum exposure to loss related to VIEs that are not consolidated (see Note 5).
1138118_18_ITEM8_P16_S0	Voting Interest Entities (VOEs) For VOEs, we consolidate the entity if we have a controlling financial interest.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P16_S1	We have a controlling financial interest in a VOE if (i) for legal entities other than limited partnerships, we own a majority voting interest in the VOE or, for limited partnerships and similar entities, we own a majority of the entity s kick-out rights through voting limited partnership interests and (ii) non-controlling shareholders or partners do not hold substantive participating rights and no other conditions exist that would indicate that we do not control the entity.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P16_S2	Other Investments Our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, but do not control, or entities which are variable interest entities in which we are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for under the equity method.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P16_S3	We eliminate transactions with such equity method subsidiaries to the extent of our ownership in such subsidiaries.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P16_S4	Accordingly, our share of the earnings from these equity-method basis companies is included in consolidated net income.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P16_S5	All other investments held on a long-term basis are valued at cost less any impairment in value.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P16_S6	Under either the equity or cost method, impairment losses are recognized upon evidence of other-than-temporary losses of value.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P17_S0	When testing for impairment on investments that are not actively traded on a public market, we generally use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our investments and/or look to comparable activities in the marketplace.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P17_S1	Management s judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow approach.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P17_S2	These assumptions include net asset values, internal rates of return, discount and capitalization rates, interest rates and financing terms, rental rates, timing of leasing activity, estimates of lease terms and related concessions, etc.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P17_S3	When determining if impairment is other-than-temporary, we also look to the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been less than cost as well as the financial condition and near-term prospects of each investment.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P18_S0	Use of Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.), or GAAP, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P18_S1	These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses we report.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P18_S2	Such estimates include the value of goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets, accounts receivable, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, retirement and other post-employment benefits, among others.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P18_S3	These estimates and assumptions are based on management s best judgment, and are evaluated on an ongoing basis and adjusted, as needed, using historical experience and other factors, including consideration of the macroeconomic environment.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P18_S4	As future events and their effects cannot be forecast with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P18_S5	Changes in estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P19_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents generally consist of cash and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P19_S1	Included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 is cash and cash equivalents of $123.8 million and $73.3 million, respectively, from consolidated funds and other entities, which are not available for general corporate use.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P19_S2	We also manage certain cash and cash equivalents as an agent for our investment and property and facilities management clients.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P19_S3	These amounts are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets (see Note 17).
1138118_18_ITEM8_P20_S0	Restricted Cash Included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 is restricted cash of $73.0 million and $68.8 million, respectively.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P20_S1	The balances primarily include restricted cash set aside to cover funding obligations as required by contracts executed by us in the ordinary course of business.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P21_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist principally of trade receivables and interest-bearing investments.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P21_S1	Users of real estate services account for a substantial portion of trade receivables and collateral is generally not required.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P21_S2	The risk associated with this concentration is limited due to the large number of users and their geographic dispersion.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P22_S0	We place substantially all of our interest-bearing investments with several major financial institutions to limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P23_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment, which includes leasehold improvements, is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P23_S1	Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment is computed primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging up to 10 years.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P24_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the term of their associated leases, excluding options to renew, since such leases generally do not carry prohibitive penalties for non-renewal.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P25_S0	We capitalize expenditures that significantly increase the life of our assets and expense the costs of maintenance and repairs.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P25_S1	We review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P25_S2	If this review indicates that such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment is recognized in the period the changes occur and represents the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P26_S0	Certain costs related to the development or purchase of internal-use software are capitalized.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P26_S1	Internal-use software costs that are incurred in the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P26_S2	Significant direct consulting costs and certain payroll and related costs, which are incurred during the development stage of a project are generally capitalized and amortized over a three-year period (except for enterprise software development platforms, which range from three to seven years) when placed into production.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P27_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting, which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P27_S1	The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P27_S2	The majority of our goodwill balance has resulted from our acquisition of CBRE Services, Inc. (CBRE Services) in 2001 (the 2001 Acquisition), our acquisition of Insignia Financial Group, Inc. (Insignia) in 2003 (the Insignia Acquisition), our acquisition of the Trammell Crow Company in 2006 (the Trammell Crow Company Acquisition), our acquisition of substantially all of the ING Group N.V. (ING) Real Estate Investment Management (REIM) operations in Europe and Asia, as well as substantially all of Clarion Real Estate Securities (CRES) in 2011 (collectively referred to as the REIM Acquisitions), our acquisition of Norland Managed Services Ltd (Norland) in 2013 (the Norland Acquisition) and our acquisition of Johnson Controls, Inc. (JCI) s Global Workplace Solutions (JCI-GWS) business in 2015 .
1138118_18_ITEM8_P27_S3	Other intangible assets that have indefinite estimated useful lives that are not being amortized include certain management contracts identified in the REIM Acquisitions, a trademark, which was separately identified as a result of the 2001 Acquisition, as well as a trade name separately identified as a result of the REIM Acquisitions.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P27_S4	The remaining other intangible assets primarily include customer relationships, mortgage servicing rights, trademarks, management contracts and covenants not to compete, which are all being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging up to 20 years.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P28_S0	We are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually, or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P29_S0	The goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step process.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P30_S0	The first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P30_S1	We use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P30_S2	Management s judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P30_S3	These assumptions include revenue growth rates, profit margin percentages, discount rates, etc.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P31_S0	If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P31_S1	If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P32_S0	The second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P32_S1	The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one, over the estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P32_S2	Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business s fair value and the relative size of our goodwill, if different assumptions and estimates were used, it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P33_S0	Deferred Financing Costs Costs incurred in connection with financing activities are generally deferred and amortized over the terms of the related debt agreements ranging up to ten years.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P33_S1	D ebt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability are presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P33_S2	Amortization of these costs is charged to interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P34_S0	Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-15, Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements permits classifying debt issuance costs associated with a line of credit arrangement as an asset, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the arrangement.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P34_S1	Total deferred financing costs, net of accumulated amortization, related to our revolving line of credit have been included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and were $23.0 million and $22.2 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P34_S2	During 2017, we entered into a new credit agreement providing for a $750.0 million delayed draw tranche A term loan facility and a $2.8 billion revolving credit facility.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P34_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2017, in connection with these financing activities, we incurred approximately $8.0 million of financing costs.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P34_S4	On March 21, 2016, we executed an amendment to our 2015 amended and restated credit agreement which, among other things, extended the maturity on our revolving credit facility and increased the borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P34_S5	In connection with this amendment, we incurred approximately $5.4 million of financing costs.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P34_S6	During 2015, we entered into our 2015 amended and restated credit agreement providing for a $500.0 million tranche A term loan facility and a $2.6 billion revolving credit facility.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P34_S7	In addition, we added new tranche B-1 and tranche B-2 term loan facilities under this same credit facility pursuant to which we borrowed an additional $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P34_S8	During the year ended December 31, 2015, in connection with these financing activities, we incurred approximately $21.7 million of financing costs, of which $1.0 million was expensed.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P34_S9	In addition, we expensed $1.7 million of previously-deferred financing costs.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P34_S10	All of these write-offs were included in write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P34_S11	See Note 11 for additional information on activities associated with our debt.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P35_S0	Revenue Recognition We record commission revenue on real estate sales generally upon close of escrow or transfer of title, except when future contingencies exist.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P35_S1	Real estate commissions on leases are generally recorded in revenue when all obligations under the commission agreement are satisfied.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P36_S0	Terms and conditions of a commission agreement may include, but are not limited to, execution of a signed lease agreement and future contingencies including tenant occupancy, payment of a deposit or payment of a first month s rent (or a combination thereof).
1138118_18_ITEM8_P36_S1	A commission agreement may provide that we earn a portion of a lease commission upon the execution of the lease agreement by the tenant and landlord, with the remaining portion(s) of the lease commission earned at a later date, usually upon tenant occupancy or payment of rent.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P36_S2	The existence of any significant future contingencies results in the delay of recognition of corresponding revenue until such contingencies are satisfied.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P36_S3	For example, if we do not earn all or a portion of the lease commission until the tenant pays its first month s rent, and the lease agreement provides the tenant with a free rent period, we delay revenue recognition until rent is paid by the tenant.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P36_S4	As some of these conditions are outside of our control and are often not clearly defined, judgment must be exercised in determining when such required events have occurred in order to recognize revenue.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P37_S0	Property and facilities management revenues are generally based on measures consistent with the terms of the customer contracts.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P38_S0	These contracts are negotiated utilizing a variety of terms covering various lengths of time.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P38_S1	The fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related agreements.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P38_S2	We also may earn revenue based on certain qualitative and quantitative performance measures.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P38_S3	We recognize this revenue when the performance has been completed, the measure has been calculated and fees are deemed collectible.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P39_S0	Our clients reimburse us for certain expenses incurred on their behalf, primarily in our property and facilities management operations.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P39_S1	Our treatment of these reimbursements is based upon the terms of the underlying contract.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P39_S2	We use certain indicators as to whether we record the reimbursements on a gross versus net basis, such as whether we are the primary obligor on the contracts, whether the contract is based on a fixed fee, credit risk and our discretion in making vendor selections and establishing prices.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P39_S3	In certain instances, we have determined we are acting as the principal in the transaction and, accordingly, report these reimbursements as revenue on a gross basis with the total costs reflected in cost of services.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P39_S4	Reimbursement revenue is recognized when the underlying reimbursable costs are incurred.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P39_S5	When we determine we are not the primary obligor and are acting as an agent, we account for the transaction on a net basis.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P40_S0	Investment management fees are based predominantly upon a percentage of the equity deployed on behalf of our limited partners.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P40_S1	Fees related to our indirect investment management programs are based upon a percentage of the fair value of those investments.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P40_S2	These fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related investment management agreements.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P41_S0	Our Global Investment Management segment earns performance-based incentive fees with regard to many of its investments.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P41_S1	Such revenue is recognized at the end of the measurement periods when the conditions of the applicable incentive fee arrangements have been satisfied and following the expiration of any potential claw back provision.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P41_S2	With many of these investments, our Global Investment Management professionals have participation interests in such incentive fees, which are commonly referred to as carried interest.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P41_S3	This carried interest expense is generally accrued for based upon the probability of such performance-based incentive fees being earned over the related vesting period.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P41_S4	In addition, our Global Investment Management segment also earns success-based transaction fees with regard to buying or selling properties on behalf of certain funds and separate accounts.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P41_S5	Such revenue is recognized at the completion of a successful transaction and is not subject to any claw back provision.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P42_S0	Appraisal fees are recorded after services have been rendered.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P42_S1	and we have no significant remaining obligations for performance in connection with the transaction, while loan servicing fees are recorded in revenue as monthly principal and interest payments are collected from mortgagors.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P42_S2	Other commissions, consulting fees and referral fees are recorded as revenue at the time the related services have been performed, unless future contingencies exist.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P43_S0	Development services and project management services generate fees from development and construction management projects.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P43_S1	Most development and construction management and project management assignments are subject to agreements that describe the calculation of fees and when we earn such fees.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P43_S2	The earnings terms of these agreements dictate when we recognize the related revenue.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P43_S3	Generally, development fees are recognized based on the lower of the amount billed or the amount determined on a straight-line basis over the development period.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P44_S0	We may earn incentive fees for project management services based upon achievement of certain performance criteria as set forth in the project management services agreement.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P44_S1	Incentive development fees are recognized when quantitative criteria have been met (such as specified leasing, budget or time-based targets) or for those incentive fees based on qualitative criteria, upon approval of the fee by our clients.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P44_S2	Certain incentive development fees allow us to share in the fair value of the developed real estate asset above cost.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P44_S3	This sharing creates additional revenue potential to us with no exposure to loss other than opportunity cost.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P44_S4	We recognize such fees when the specified target is attained and fees are deemed collectible.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P45_S0	We record deferred income to the extent that cash payments have been received in accordance with the terms of underlying agreements, but such amounts have not yet met the criteria for revenue recognition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P45_S1	We recognize such revenues when the appropriate criteria are met.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P46_S0	In establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables, we make assumptions with respect to future collectability.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P46_S1	Our assumptions are based on an assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends, including the aging of receivables balances.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P46_S2	In addition to these assessments, in general, outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are more than 180 days overdue are evaluated for collectability and fully provided for if deemed uncollectible.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P47_S0	Historically, our credit losses have generally been insignificant.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P47_S1	However, estimating losses requires significant judgment, and conditions may change or new information may become known after any periodic evaluation.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P47_S2	As a result, actual credit losses may differ from our estimates.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P48_S0	The costs of business promotion and advertising are expensed as incurred.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P48_S1	Business promotion and advertising costs of $63.1 million, $65.8 million and $62.7 million were included in operating, administrative and other expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P49_S0	The financial statements of subsidiaries located outside the U.S. are generally measured using the local currency as the functional currency.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P49_S1	The assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date, and income and expenses are translated at the average monthly rate.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P49_S2	The resulting translation adjustments are included in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of equity.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P49_S3	Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the results of operations.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P50_S0	As required by FASB ASC Topic 815 Derivatives and Hedging , we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P50_S1	We do not net derivatives on our balance sheet.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P50_S2	The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P51_S0	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P51_S1	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P51_S2	Derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P52_S0	Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P53_S0	We may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of our risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or we elect not to apply hedge accounting.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P53_S1	In all cases, we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and, accordingly, do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P54_S0	Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income (loss).
1138118_18_ITEM8_P54_S1	In the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, accumulated other comprehensive loss consists of foreign currency translation adjustments, fees associated with the termination of interest rate swaps, unrealized gains (losses) on interest rate swaps, unrealized holding gains (losses) on available for sale securities and pension liability adjustments.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P54_S2	Foreign currency translation adjustments exclude any income tax effect given that earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries are deemed to be reinvested for an indefinite period of time (see Note 14).
1138118_18_ITEM8_P55_S0	Marketable Securities We account for investments in marketable debt and equity securities in accordance with the Investments Debt and Equity Securities Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 320).
1138118_18_ITEM8_P55_S1	We determine the appropriate classification of debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P56_S0	Marketable securities we acquire with the intent to generate a profit from short-term movements in market prices are classified as trading securities.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P56_S1	Debt securities are classified as held to maturity when we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P56_S2	Marketable equity and debt securities not classified as trading or held to maturity are classified as available for sale.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P57_S0	Trading securities are carried at their fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in net income.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P57_S1	Available for sale securities are carried at their fair value and any difference between cost and fair value is recorded as unrealized gain or loss, net of income taxes, and is reported as accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated statement of equity.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P58_S0	Premiums and discounts are recognized in interest using the effective interest method.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P58_S1	Realized gains and losses and declines in value expected to be other-than-temporary on available for sale securities have not been significant.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P59_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P59_S1	Interest and dividends on securities classified as available for sale are included in interest income.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P60_S0	For investments classified as available for sale, we assess impairment at the individual security level.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P60_S1	An investment is impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost basis.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P60_S2	When an impairment exists, we assess whether such impairment is temporary or other-than-temporary.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P60_S3	We review the volatility and intended holding period of our investments and also determine if we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that the value would be recovered over the intended holding period.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P60_S4	Based on our review, we did not record any significant other-than-temporary impairment losses during the years ending December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P61_S0	Our wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE Capital Markets, Inc. (CBRE Capital Markets) is a Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) approved Multifamily Program Plus Seller/Servicer and an approved Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) Aggregation and Negotiated Transaction Seller/Servicer.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P61_S1	In addition, CBRE Capital Markets wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE Multifamily Capital, Inc. (CBRE MCI) is an approved Fannie Mae Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS) Seller/Servicer and CBRE Capital Markets wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE HMF is a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) approved Non-Supervised Federal Housing Authority (FHA) Title II Mortgagee, an approved Multifamily Accelerated Processing (MAP) lender and an approved Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) issuer of mortgage-backed securities (MBS).
1138118_18_ITEM8_P62_S0	Under these arrangements, before loans are originated through proceeds from warehouse lines of credit, we obtain either a contractual loan purchase commitment from either Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae or a confirmed forward trade commitment for the issuance and purchase of a Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae MBS that will be secured by the loans.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P62_S1	The warehouse lines of credit are generally repaid within a one-month period when Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae buys the loans or upon settlement of the Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae MBS, while we retain the servicing rights.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P63_S0	Loans are funded at the prevailing market rates.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P64_S0	We elect the fair value option for all warehouse receivables.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P64_S1	At December 31, 2017 and 2016, all of the warehouse receivables included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were either under commitment to be purchased by Freddie Mac or had confirmed forward trade commitments for the issuance and purchase of Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities that will be secured by the underlying loans.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P65_S0	In connection with the origination and sale of mortgage loans with servicing rights retained, we record servicing assets or liabilities based on the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights on the date the loans are sold.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P66_S0	Our mortgage service rights (MSRs) are initially recorded at fair value.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P66_S1	Subsequent to the initial recording, MSRs are amortized and carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value in other intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P66_S2	They are amortized in proportion to and over the estimated period that net servicing income is expected to be received based on projections and timing of estimated future net cash flows.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P66_S3	Our initial recording of MSRs at their fair value resulted in net gains, as the fair value of servicing contracts that result in MSR assets exceeded the fair value of servicing contracts that result in MSR liabilities.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P66_S4	The net assets and net gains are presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P67_S0	The amount of MSRs recognized during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_18_ITEM8_P68_S0	MSRs do not actively trade in an open market with readily available observable prices; therefore, fair value is determined based on certain assumptions and judgments, including the estimation of the present value of future cash flows realized from servicing the underlying mortgage loans.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P68_S1	Management s assumptions include the benefits of servicing (servicing fee income and interest on escrow deposits), inflation, the cost of servicing, prepayment rates, delinquencies, discount rates and the estimated life of servicing cash flows.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P68_S2	The assumptions used are subject to change based on management s judgments and estimates of changes in future cash flows and interest rates, among other things.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P68_S3	The key assumptions used during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 in measuring fair value were as follows:
1138118_18_ITEM8_P69_S0	The estimated fair value of our MSRs was $446.3 million and $375.5 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P69_S1	Impairment is evaluated through a comparison of the carrying amount and fair value of the MSRs, and recognized with the establishment of a valuation allowance.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P69_S2	We did not incur any impairment charges related to our MSRs during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P69_S3	No valuation allowance was created previously and we did not record a valuation allowance for MSRs in 2017 or 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P69_S4	Included in revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations are contractually specified servicing fees from loans serviced for others of $144.2 million, $115.3 million and $92.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and prepayment fees/late fees/ancillary income earned from loans serviced for others of $13.2 million, $7.2 million and $8.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P70_S0	Accounting for Broker Draws As part of our recruitment efforts relative to new U.S. brokers, we offer a transitional broker draw arrangement.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P70_S1	Our broker draw arrangements generally last until such time as a broker s pipeline of business is sufficient to allow him or her to earn sustainable commissions.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P71_S0	This program is intended to provide the broker with a minimal amount of cash flow to allow adequate time for his or her training as well as time for him or her to develop business relationships.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P71_S1	Similar to traditional salaries, the broker draws are paid irrespective of the actual revenues generated by the broker.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P71_S2	Often these broker draws represent the only form of compensation received by the broker.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P71_S3	Furthermore, it is not our general policy to pursue collection of unearned broker draws paid under this arrangement.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P71_S4	As a result, we have concluded that broker draws are economically equivalent to salaries paid and accordingly charge them to compensation expense as incurred.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P72_S0	The broker is also entitled to earn a commission on completed revenue transactions.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P72_S1	This amount is calculated as the commission that would have been payable under our full commission program, less any amounts previously paid to the broker in the form of a draw.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P73_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We account for all employee awards under the fair value recognition provisions of the Compensation Stock Compensation Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 718).
1138118_18_ITEM8_P73_S1	Topic 718 requires the measurement of compensation cost at the grant date, based upon the estimated fair value of the award, and requires amortization of the related expense over the employee s requisite service period.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P74_S0	In the third quarter of 2016, we elected to early adopt the provisions of ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which required us to reflect any adjustments as of January 1, 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P75_S0	ASU 2016-09 permitted companies to make an accounting policy election to either estimate forfeitures on share-based payment awards, as previously required, or to recognize forfeitures as they occur.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P75_S1	We elected to change our accounting policy to recognize forfeitures when they occur and the impact of this change in accounting policy was recorded as a $3.3 million cumulative effect adjustment to accumulated earnings as of January 1, 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P75_S2	See Note 13 for additional information on our stock-based compensation plans.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P76_S0	Basic income per share attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. is computed by dividing net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P76_S1	The computation of diluted income per share attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. generally further assumes the dilutive effect of potential common shares, which include stock options and certain contingently issuable shares.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P76_S2	Contingently issuable shares consist of non-vested stock awards.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P77_S0	Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with the Accounting for Income Taxes Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 740).
1138118_18_ITEM8_P78_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P78_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P78_S2	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P79_S0	Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P80_S0	See Note 14 for additional information on income taxes, including a discussion of the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), which was signed into law on December 22, 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P81_S0	Self-Insurance Our wholly-owned captive insurance company, which is subject to applicable insurance rules and regulations, insures our exposure related to workers compensation insurance, general liability insurance and automotive insurance for our U.S. operations risk on a primary basis and we purchase excess coverage from unrelated insurance carriers.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P81_S1	The captive insurance company also insures primary risk relating to professional indemnity claims globally.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P81_S2	Given the nature of these types of claims, it may take several years for resolution and determination of the cost of these claims.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P81_S3	We are required to estimate the cost of these claims in our financial statements.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P81_S4	The estimates that we utilize to record our potential losses on claims are inherently subjective, and actual claims could differ from amounts recorded, which could result in increased or decreased expense in future periods.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P81_S5	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our reserves for claims under these insurance programs were $93.7 million and $80.6 million, respectively, of which $2.8 million and $1.7 million, respectively, represented our estimated current liabilities.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P82_S0	The FASB has recently issued five ASUs related to revenue recognition ( new revenue recognition guidance ), all of which will become effective for the company on January 1, 2018.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P82_S1	The ASUs issued are: (1) in May 2014, ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606); (2) i n March 2016, ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net); (3) in April 2016, ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing; (4) in May 2016, ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-scope Improvements and Practical Expedients; and (5) in December 2016, ASU 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue From Contracts with Customers.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P83_S0	ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers and will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P83_S1	The ASU also requires entities to disclose both quantitative and qualitative information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P83_S2	This ASU permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P83_S3	ASU 2016-08 clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P83_S4	ASU 2016-10 clarifies guidance related to identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation guidance contained in ASU 2014-09.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P83_S5	ASU 2016-12 clarifies guidance in certain narrow areas and adds some practical expedients.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P83_S6	ASU 2016-20 also clarifies guidance in certain narrow areas and adds optional exemptions to certain disclosure requirements.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P83_S7	We plan to adopt the new revenue recognition guidance in the first quarter of 2018 using the retrospective transition method.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P83_S8	Based on our assessment, the impact of the application of the new revenue recognition guidance will result in an acceleration of some revenues that are based, in part, on future contingent events.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P83_S9	For example, some leasing commission revenues in various countries where we operate will be recognized earlier.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P83_S10	Under current GAAP, a portion of these lease commission revenues are deferred until a future contingency is resolved (e.g., tenant move-in or payment of first month s rent).
1138118_18_ITEM8_P83_S11	Under the new revenue guidance, the company s performance obligation will be typically satisfied at lease signing and therefore the portion of the commission that is contingent on a future event will likely be recognized earlier if deemed not subject to significant reversal.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P83_S12	We expect the earlier recognition of these revenues to result in an increase in total assets and liabilities to reflect contract assets and accrued commissions payable.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P84_S0	We have evaluated the impact of the updated principal versus agent guidance on our consolidated financial statements.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P84_S1	Under existing GAAP, certain of our facilities and project management contracts are accounted for on a net basis because the contracts include provisions such as pay when paid that mitigate payment risk with respect to services provided by third parties to our clients.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P84_S2	Under the updated guidance, control of the services before transfer to the client is the primary factor in determining principal versus agent assessments.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P84_S3	Payment risk will no longer be a determining factor under ASC Topic 606.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P85_S0	Accordingly, under the new guidance, we will account for the cost of services provided by third parties and the related reimbursement revenue on a gross basis.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P85_S1	Under the retrospective method, based upon our evaluations which are not yet complete, we estimate that the 2016 and 2017 consolidated statements of operations will reflect approximately $4 to $5 billion of additional revenue and cost of services as a result of this change, with no impact on profitability.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P86_S0	(Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P86_S1	This ASU will significantly change the income statement impact of equity investments and the recognition of changes in fair value of financial liabilities when the fair value option is elected.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P86_S2	This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P86_S3	Early adoption is not permitted, except for the provisions related to the recognition of changes in fair value of financial liabilities when the fair value option is elected.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P86_S4	We do not believe the adoption of ASU 2016-01 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P87_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).
1138118_18_ITEM8_P87_S1	This ASU requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet as liabilities, with corresponding right-of-use assets.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P87_S2	For income statement recognition purposes, leases will be classified as either a finance or operating lease in a manner similar to the requirements under the current lease accounting literature, but without relying upon the bright-line tests.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P87_S3	This ASU is effective for annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and mandates a modified retrospective transition method for all entities.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P87_S4	We plan to adopt ASU 2016-02 in the first quarter of 2019 and are currently continuing to evaluate the magnitude of its impact on our consolidated financial statements by reviewing our existing lease contracts and service contracts that may include embedded leases.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P88_S0	In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P88_S1	This ASU is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring timelier recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments held by financial institutions and other organizations.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P88_S2	This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P89_S0	We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-13 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P90_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P90_S1	This ASU addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P90_S2	This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P90_S3	At this point in time, we do not believe the adoption of ASU 2016-15 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P91_S0	In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P91_S1	This ASU requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P91_S2	This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P91_S3	At this point in time, we do not believe the adoption of ASU 2016-16 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P92_S0	In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P92_S1	This ASU requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P92_S2	As a result, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P92_S3	This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P92_S4	At this point in time, we do not believe the adoption of ASU 2016-18 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P93_S0	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P93_S1	This ASU eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P93_S2	This ASU also eliminates the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P93_S3	This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P93_S4	We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2017-04 will have on our goodwill assessment process, but do not believe the adoption of ASU 2017-04 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P94_S0	In February 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-05, Other Income Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets (Subtopic 610-20): Clarifying the Scope of Asset Derecognition Guidance and Accounting for Partial Sales of Nonfinancial Assets.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P94_S1	This ASU clarifies that a financial asset is within the scope of Subtopic 610-20 if it meets the definition of an in substance nonfinancial asset and also defines the term in substance nonfinancial asset.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P94_S2	This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P94_S3	At this point in time, we do not believe the adoption of ASU 2017-05 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P95_S0	In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-08, Receivables Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20), Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P95_S1	This ASU requires the premium to be amortized to the earliest call date.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P95_S2	This ASU does not require an accounting change for securities held at a discount; the discount continues to be amortized to maturity.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P95_S3	This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P96_S0	We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2017-08 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P97_S0	In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P97_S1	This ASU refines and expands hedge accounting for both financial and commodity risks.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P97_S2	This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P98_S0	We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2017-12 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P98_S1	Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2016 and 2015 financial statements to conform with the 2017 presentation.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P99_S0	On September 1, 2015, CBRE, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, pursuant to a Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement with JCI, acquired JCI s GWS business (we refer to as the GWS Acquisition).
1138118_18_ITEM8_P99_S1	The acquired JCI-GWS business was a market-leading provider of integrated facilities management solutions for major occupiers of commercial real estate and had significant operations around the world.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P99_S2	The purchase price was $1.475 billion, paid in cash, plus adjustments totaling $46.5 million for working capital and other items.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P99_S3	We completed the GWS Acquisition in order to advance our strategy of delivering globally integrated services to major occupiers in our Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific segments.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P99_S4	We merged the acquired JCI-GWS business with our existing occupier outsourcing business line, and the new combined business adopted the Global Workplace Solutions name.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P99_S5	We financed the transaction with: (i) an issuance in August 2015 of $600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due March 1, 2026; (ii) borrowings in September 2015 of $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of tranche B-1 and tranche B-2 term loan facilities under our amended and restated credit agreement dated January 9, 2015 (2015 Credit Agreement); (iii) borrowings under the revolving credit facility under the 2015 Credit Agreement; and (iv) cash on hand.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P99_S6	See Note 11 for more information on the abovementioned debt instruments.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P99_S7	The accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 included revenue, operating income and net income of $982.0 million, $27.7 million and $18.8 million, respectively, attributable to the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P100_S0	and amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired of $24.2 million, all of which were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015 in connection with the GWS Acquisition.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P100_S1	Unaudited pro forma results, assuming the GWS Acquisition had occurred as of January 1, 2015 for purposes of the 2015 pro forma disclosures, are presented below.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P100_S2	They include certain adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2015, including $47.5 million of increased amortization expense as a result of intangible assets acquired in the GWS Acquisition, $23.9 million of additional interest expense as a result of debt incurred to finance the GWS Acquisition, the removal of $48.9 million of direct costs incurred by us related to the GWS Acquisition, and the tax impact for the year ended December 31, 2015 of these pro forma adjustments.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P100_S3	These pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of what operating results would have been had the GWS Acquisition occurred on January 1, 2015 and may not be indicative of future operating results (dollars in thousands, except share data):
1138118_18_ITEM8_P101_S0	A rollforward of our warehouse receivables is as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_18_ITEM8_P102_S0	The following table is a summary of our warehouse lines of credit in place as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars in thousands):
1138118_18_ITEM8_P103_S0	Temporary facility to accommodate year-end volume.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P104_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2017, we had a maximum of $2.3 billion of warehouse lines of credit principal outstanding.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P105_S0	We hold variable interests in certain VIEs in our Global Investment Management and Development Services segments which are not consolidated as it was determined that we are not the primary beneficiary.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P105_S1	Our involvement with these entities is in the form of equity co-investments and fee arrangements.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P105_S2	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our maximum exposure to loss related to the VIEs which are not consolidated was as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_18_ITEM8_P106_S0	The Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic (Topic 820) of the FASB ASC defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P106_S1	Topic 820 also establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P106_S2	This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P106_S3	The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:
1138118_18_ITEM8_P107_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P108_S0	Level 2 Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P109_S0	Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P109_S1	This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P110_S0	There were no significant transfers in or out of Level 1 and Level 2 during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P111_S0	The following tables present the fair value of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars in thousands):
1138118_18_ITEM8_P112_S0	The fair values of the warehouse receivables are calculated based on already locked in security buy prices.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P112_S1	At December 31, 2017 and 2016, all of the warehouse receivables included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were either under commitment to be purchased by Freddie Mac or had confirmed forward trade commitments for the issuance and purchase of Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae mortgage backed securities that will be secured by the underlying loans (See Notes 2 and 4).
1138118_18_ITEM8_P113_S0	These assets are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as all inputs are readily observable.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P114_S0	The valuation of interest rate swaps and foreign currency exchange forward contracts is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P114_S1	This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate and foreign currency exchange forward curves.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P115_S0	The fair values of interest rate swaps and foreign currency exchange forward contracts are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future estimated cash payments/receipts.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P115_S1	The estimated cash flows are based on an expectation of future interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates using forward curves derived from observable market interest rate and foreign currency exchange forward curves.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P115_S2	Fair value measurements for our available for sale securities are obtained from independent pricing services which utilize observable market data that may include quoted market prices, dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. treasury yield curve, trading levels, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the instrument's terms and conditions.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P116_S0	The trading securities and securities sold, not yet purchased are primarily in the U.S. and are generally valued at the last reported sales price on the day of valuation or, if no sales occurred on the valuation date, at the mean of the bid and asked prices on such date.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P116_S1	There were no significant non-recurring fair value measurements recorded during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P117_S0	FASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P117_S1	Our financial instruments are as follows:
1138118_18_ITEM8_P118_S0	These balances include cash and cash equivalents as well as restricted cash with maturities of less than three months.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P118_S1	The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P119_S0	Receivables, less Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Due to their short-term nature, fair value approximates carrying value.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P120_S0	These balances are carried at fair value based on market prices at the balance sheet date.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P121_S0	Trading and Available for Sale Securities These investments are carried at their fair value.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P122_S0	Foreign Currency Exchange Forward Contracts These assets and liabilities are carried at their fair value as calculated by using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P123_S0	Securities Sold, not yet Purchased These liabilities are carried at their fair value.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P124_S0	The majority of this balance represents outstanding amounts under our warehouse lines of credit of our wholly-owned subsidiary, CBRE Capital Markets.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P124_S1	Due to the short-term nature and variable interest rates of these instruments, fair value approximates carrying value (see Notes 4 and 11).
1138118_18_ITEM8_P125_S0	Interest Rate Swaps These liabilities are carried at their fair value as calculated by using widely-accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative (see Note 7).
1138118_18_ITEM8_P126_S0	Notes Payable on Real Estate: As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the carrying value of our notes payable on real estate, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, was $17.9 million and $26.0 million, respectively.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P126_S1	These notes payable were not recourse to CBRE Group, Inc., except for being recourse to the single-purpose entities that held the real estate assets and were the primary obligors on the notes payable.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P127_S0	These borrowings have either fixed interest rates or floating interest rates at spreads added to a market index.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P128_S0	Although it is possible that certain portions of our notes payable on real estate may have fair values that differ from their carrying values, based on the terms of such loans as compared to current market conditions, or other factors specific to the borrower entity, we do not believe that the fair value of our notes payable is significantly different than their carrying value.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P129_S0	We are exposed to certain risks arising from both our business operations and economic conditions.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P129_S1	We manage economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources and duration of our debt funding and by using derivative financial instruments.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P129_S2	Specifically, we enter into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the payment of future known but uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P129_S3	Our derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing and duration of our known or expected cash payments principally related to our borrowings.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P130_S0	We do not net derivatives on our balance sheet.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P130_S1	Our objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P130_S2	To accomplish this objective, we primarily use interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P130_S3	In July 2015, we entered into three interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $300.0 million, all with effective dates in August 2015, and designated them as cash flow hedges in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging .
1138118_18_ITEM8_P130_S4	We structured these swap agreements to attempt to hedge the variability of future interest payments due to changes in interest rates prior to us issuing the 4.875% senior notes (see Note 11).
1138118_18_ITEM8_P130_S5	In August 2015, we elected to terminate these agreements and paid a $6.2 million cash settlement, which was recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and is being amortized to interest expense throughout the remaining term of the terminated hedge transaction until August 2025.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P130_S6	There was no hedge ineffectiveness for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P130_S7	We reclassified $0.6 million in each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P130_S8	During the next twelve months, we estimate that $0.6 million will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P131_S0	In March 2011, we entered into five interest rate swap agreements, all with effective dates in October 2011, and immediately designated them as cash flow hedges in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P131_S1	The purpose of these interest rate swap agreements is to attempt to hedge potential changes to our cash flows due to the variable interest nature of our senior term loan facilities.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P131_S2	The total notional amount of these interest rate swap agreements is $400.0 million, with $200.0 million having expired in October 2017 and $200.0 million expiring in September 2019.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P132_S0	The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P132_S1	There was no significant hedge ineffectiveness for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P133_S0	The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the balance sheet and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P133_S1	We reclassified $7.4 million, $10.7 million and $11.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P133_S2	During the next twelve months, we estimate that $3.1 million will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P133_S3	In addition, we recorded a net gain of $0.9 million, and net losses of $2.4 million and $6.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, to other comprehensive loss in relation to such interest rate swap agreements.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P133_S4	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the fair values of such interest rate swap agreements were reflected as a $4.8 million liability and a $13.2 million liability, respectively, and were included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P134_S0	Additionally, our foreign operations expose us to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P134_S1	These fluctuations may impact the value of our cash receipts and payments in terms of our functional (reporting) currency, which is U.S. dollars.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P134_S2	We enter into derivative financial instruments to attempt to protect the value or fix the amount of certain obligations in terms of our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P134_S3	In March 2014, we began a foreign currency exchange forward hedging program by entering into foreign currency exchange forward contracts, including agreements to buy U.S. dollars and sell Australian dollars, British pound sterling, Canadian dollars, euros and Japanese yen.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P134_S4	The purpose of these forward contracts was to attempt to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that would adversely impact some of our foreign currency denominated EBITDA.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P134_S5	Hedge accounting was not elected for any of these contracts.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P134_S6	As such, changes in the fair values of these contracts were recorded directly in earnings.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P135_S0	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had no foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding as the program expired in December 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P135_S1	Included in the consolidated statement of operations were net gains of $7.7 million and $24.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, resulting from net gains on foreign currency exchange forward contracts.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P135_S2	We also routinely monitor our exposure to currency exchange rate changes in connection with certain transactions and sometimes enter into foreign currency exchange option and forward contracts to limit our exposure to such transactions, as appropriate.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P135_S3	In the ordinary course of business, we also sometimes utilize derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange contracts to attempt to mitigate foreign currency exchange exposure resulting from intercompany loans.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P135_S4	The net impact on our financial position and earnings resulting from these foreign currency exchange forward and options contracts has not been significant.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P136_S0	Property and equipment consists of the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_18_ITEM8_P137_S0	Depreciation and amortization expense associated with property and equipment was $166.0 million, $151.2 million and $137.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

1138118_18_ITEM8_P140_S2	When we performed our required annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we determined that no impairment existed as the estimated fair value of our reporting units was in excess of their carrying value.

1138118_18_ITEM8_P194_S1	The actual number of EPS Performance RSUs that will vest is determined by measuring our cumulative adjusted income per share growth against the cumulative EPS growth, as reported under GAAP (GAAP EPS), of each of the other members of the Comparison Group over a six-year measurement period commencing on January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2023.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P195_S0	Each type of RSU subject to the Special RSU grant generally vests in full six years from the grant date.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P196_S0	We estimated the fair value of the TSR Performance RSUs referred to above on the date of the grant using a Monte Carlo simulation with the following assumptions:
1138118_18_ITEM8_P197_S0	Lastly, on December 15, 2017, we granted 127,160 RSUs that are time vesting in nature to certain senior brokers.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P197_S1	Such awards generally vest in full three years from the grant date.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P197_S2	A summary of the status of our non-vested stock awards is presented in the table below:
1138118_18_ITEM8_P198_S0	Total compensation expense related to non-vested stock awards was $93.1 million, $63.5 million and $74.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P198_S1	At December 31, 2017, total unrecognized estimated compensation cost related to non-vested stock awards was approximately $243.3 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 3.8 years .
1138118_18_ITEM8_P199_S0	We have bonus programs covering select employees, including senior management.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P199_S1	Awards are based on the position and performance of the employee and the achievement of pre-established financial, operating and strategic objectives.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P199_S2	The amounts charged to expense for bonuses were $286.1 million, $248.1 million and $231.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P200_S0	Our CBRE 401(k) Plan (401(k) Plan) is a defined contribution savings plan that allows participant deferrals under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).
1138118_18_ITEM8_P200_S1	Most of our non-union U.S. employees, other than qualified real estate agents having the status of independent contractors under section 3508 of the IRC of 1986, as amended, are eligible to participate in the plan.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P200_S2	The 401(k) Plan provides for participant contributions as well as a company match.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P200_S3	A participant is allowed to contribute to the 401(k) Plan from 1% to 75% of his or her compensation, subject to limits imposed by applicable law.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P200_S4	Effective January 1, 2007, all participants hired post January 1, 2007 vest in company match contributions 20% per year for each plan year they work 1,000 hours.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P200_S5	All participants hired before January 1, 2007 are immediately vested in company match contributions.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P200_S6	For 2017, 2016, and 2015, we contributed a 50% match on the first 6%, 6% and 5%, respectively, of annual compensation (up to $150,000 of compensation) deferred by each participant.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P200_S7	In connection with the 401(k) Plan, we charged to expense $38.8 million, $44.3 million and $29.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P201_S0	Participants are entitled to invest up to 25% of their 401(k) account balance in shares of our common stock.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P201_S1	As of December 31, 2017, approximately 1.2 million shares of our common stock were held as investments by participants in our 401(k) Plan.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P202_S0	We have two contributory defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom (U.K.).
1138118_18_ITEM8_P202_S1	The London-based firm of Hillier Parker May Rowden, which we acquired in 1998, had a contributory defined benefit pension plan.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P202_S2	A subsidiary of Insignia, which we acquired in connection with the Insignia Acquisition in 2003, also had a contributory defined benefit pension plan in the U.K.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P202_S3	Our subsidiaries based in the U.K. maintain the plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in these plans.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P202_S4	With respect to these plans, our historical policy has been to contribute annually to the plans, an amount to fund pension liabilities as actuarially determined and as required by applicable laws and regulations.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P202_S5	Our contributions to these plans are invested by the plan trustee and, if these investments do not perform well in the future, we may be required to provide additional contributions to cover any pension underfunding.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P202_S6	Effective July 1, 2007, we reached agreements with the active members of these plans to freeze future pension plan benefits.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P202_S7	In return, the active members became eligible to enroll in a defined contribution plan.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P203_S0	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the fair values of pension plan assets were $333.5 million and $286.6 million, respectively, and the fair values of projected benefit obligations in aggregate were $455.6 million and $416.9 million, respectively.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P203_S1	As a result, the plans were underfunded by approximately $122.1 million and $130.3 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and were recorded as net liabilities included in other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P203_S2	Items not yet recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost (benefit) were $194.3 million and $209.6 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and were included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P203_S3	Net periodic pension cost (benefit) was not material for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P204_S0	The components of income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_18_ITEM8_P205_S0	Our tax provision (benefit) consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
1138118_18_ITEM8_P206_S0	The following is a reconciliation stated as a percentage of pre-tax income of the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate:
1138118_18_ITEM8_P207_S0	On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law making significant changes to the IRC, including, but not limited to: (i) a U.S. corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21%, effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017; (ii) the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system; and (iii) a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P208_S0	In December 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act , which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P208_S1	Our provision for income taxes for 2017 included a net charge of $143.4 million attributable to the Tax Act, with a provisional amount of $158.0 million representing our estimate of the U.S. federal and state tax impact of the transition tax (which includes the anticipated income tax benefit of the release of valuation allowances on foreign income tax credits that will be used to reduce the tax liability resulting from the transition tax), partially offset by a net income tax benefit of $14.6 million related to the re-measurement of U.S. federal deferred tax assets and liabilities (after considering certain other measures of the Act that affected our existing deferred tax assets).
1138118_18_ITEM8_P208_S2	These amounts are based upon our best estimate of the impact of the Tax Act in accordance with our understanding of the Tax Act and the related guidance available.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P208_S3	Additional work is necessary on the provisional amount related to the transition tax, which includes performing a more detailed analysis of historic foreign earnings and tax pools and potential corresponding adjustments.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P209_S0	The changes included in the Tax Act are broad and complex.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P209_S1	The final transition impacts of the Tax Act may differ from the above estimate due to, among other things, changes in interpretations of the Tax Act, any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the Tax Act, any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the Tax Act, or any updates or changes to estimates we have utilized to calculate the transition impacts, including impacts from changes to current-year earnings estimates and foreign exchange rates of foreign subsidiaries.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P209_S2	Our accounting for the effects of the Tax Act is expected to be completed within the measurement period provided by SAB 118.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P209_S3	Any subsequent adjustments to these amounts will be recorded to income tax expense from continuing operations.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P210_S0	The Tax Act also includes provisions for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) wherein taxes on foreign earnings are imposed for more than a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P210_S1	An accounting policy election allows to either: (i) account for GILTI as a component of tax expense in the period in which we are subject to the rules (the period cost method ) or (ii) account for GILTI in our measurement of deferred taxes (the deferred method ).
1138118_18_ITEM8_P210_S2	Due to the complexity of the new GILTI tax rules, we are continuing to evaluate this provision of the Tax Act and the application of Topic 740.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P210_S3	Our accounting policy election will depend, in part on analyzing our global income to determine whether we expect material tax liabilities resulting from the application of this provision and if so, whether and when to record related current and deferred income taxes and whether such amounts can be reasonably estimated.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P210_S4	Anticipated further guidance from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will clarify the manner in which the GILTI tax is computed.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P210_S5	For these reasons, we have not recorded a deferred tax expense or benefit relating to potential GILTI tax for the year ended December 31, 2017 and have not made a policy decision regarding whether to record deferred taxes on GILTI or account for the GILTI entirely as a period cost.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P211_S0	During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, we recorded a $0.1 million, $0.4 million and $3.2 million income tax benefit in connection with stock options exercised.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P211_S1	Of this income tax benefit, $2.3 million was charged directly to additional paid-in capital within the equity section of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in 2015.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P211_S2	With our adoption of ASU 2016-09 in the third quarter of 2016, which has been applied on a prospective basis to settlements of share-based payment awards occurring on or after January 1, 2016, excess tax benefits for 2016 have been recognized as income tax benefits in the income statement rather than to additional paid-in capital.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P211_S3	Cumulative tax effects of temporary differences are shown below at December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars in thousands):
1138118_18_ITEM8_P212_S0	As of December 31, 2017, we re-measured the U.S. component of the non-current deferred tax assets and liabilities at the applicable tax rate of 21% in accordance with the Tax Act.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P213_S0	As of December 31, 2017, we had U.S. federal NOLs of approximately $27.5 million, translating to a deferred tax asset before valuation allowance of $5.8 million, which will begin to expire in 2023.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P213_S1	As of December 31, 2017, there were also deferred tax assets before valuation allowances of approximately $3.3 million related to state NOLs as well as $273.1 million related to foreign NOLs.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P213_S2	The state and foreign NOLs both begin to expire in 2018, but the majority carry forward indefinitely.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P214_S0	The utilization of NOLs may be subject to certain limitations under U.S. federal, state and foreign laws.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P214_S1	We have recorded a full valuation allowance for NOLs that we believe will not be fully utilized.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P214_S2	In addition, as of December 31, 2017, we had deferred tax assets of $55.4 million related to foreign income tax credits that were reclassed to income taxes payable due to being utilized to reduce the liability related to the transition tax associated with the Tax Act.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P214_S3	We determined that as of December 31, 2017, $277.5 million of deferred tax assets do not satisfy the realization criteria set forth in Topic 740.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P214_S4	Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been recorded for this amount.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P214_S5	If released, the entire amount would result in a benefit to continuing operations.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P214_S6	During the year ended December 31, 2017, our valuation allowance decreased by approximately $7.3 million.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P214_S7	This resulted from the release of valuation allowances of $42.3 million related to foreign income tax credits primarily in connection with the enactment of the Tax Act, $6.2 million of U.S. net operating loss utilization, $5.2 million related to re-measurement due to the enactment of the Tax Act and $4.7 million of foreign net operating loss utilization.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P215_S0	We believe it is more likely than not that future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets recorded net of these valuation allowances.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P215_S1	Our foreign subsidiaries have accumulated $2.5 billion of undistributed earnings for which we have not recorded a deferred tax liability.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P215_S2	No additional income taxes have been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax, in connection with the enactment of the Tax Act, or any additional outside basis difference inherent in these entities, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P215_S3	Although tax liabilities might result from dividends being paid out of these earnings, or as a result of a sale or liquidation of foreign subsidiaries, these earnings are permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. and we do not have any plans to repatriate them or to sell or liquidate any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P215_S4	To the extent that we are able to repatriate the earnings in a tax efficient manner, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds, net of foreign tax credits.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P215_S5	Determining our tax liability upon repatriation is not practicable.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P216_S0	The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $35.8 million and $94.9 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P216_S1	The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect our effective tax rate, if recognized, is $18.8 million ($18.0 million, net of federal benefit received from state positions) and $39.1 million ($35.7 million, net of federal benefit received from state positions) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P216_S2	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_18_ITEM8_P217_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2017, we released $58.2 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits primarily due to settlement of federal tax audits for tax years 2005 to 2012.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P217_S1	As a result, we recognized $17.0 million of income tax benefits related to decreases in tax positions and $15.3 million of income tax benefits related to interest and penalties.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P217_S2	We believe the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits that will be settled during the next twelve months due to filing amended returns and settling ongoing exams cannot be reasonably estimated but will not be significant.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P217_S3	Our continuing practice is to recognize potential accrued interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters within income tax expense.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P217_S4	During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we accrued an additional $1.0 million, $2.9 million and $3.2 million, respectively, in interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P217_S5	As of December 31, 2017, and 2016, we have recognized a liability for interest and penalties of $3.9 million ($3.4 million, net of related federal benefit received from interest expense) and $31.7 million ($24.3 million, net of related federal benefit received from interest expense), respectively.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P218_S0	We conduct business globally and, as a result, one or more of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in multiple state, local and foreign jurisdictions.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P218_S1	We are no longer open to assessment by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for years prior to 2014.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P218_S2	With limited exception, our significant state and foreign tax jurisdictions are no longer subject to audit by the various tax authorities for tax years prior to 2009.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P219_S0	Our board of directors is authorized, subject to any limitations imposed by law, without the approval of our stockholders, to issue a total of 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, in one or more series, with each such series having rights and preferences including voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences, as our board of directors may determine.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P219_S1	We may repurchase shares awarded to certain grant recipients under our various equity compensation plans to satisfy minimum statutory federal, state and local tax withholding obligations arising from the vesting of their equity awards.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P219_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2015, 332,799 shares with an average price paid per share of $32.87 were repurchased relating thereto.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P219_S3	No shares were repurchased during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P219_S4	On October 27, 2016, we announced that our board of directors had authorized the company to repurchase up to an aggregate of $250 million of our Class A common stock over three years.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P219_S5	As of December 31, 2017, the authorization remained unused.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P220_S0	The following is a calculation of income per share (dollars in thousands, except share data):
1138118_18_ITEM8_P221_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 621,805, 1,833,941 and 372,020, respectively, of contingently issuable shares were excluded from the computation of diluted income per share because their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P222_S0	The accompanying consolidated balance sheets do not include the net assets of escrow, agency and fiduciary funds, which are held by us on behalf of clients and which amounted to $4.0 billion and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P223_S0	We report our operations through the following segments: (1) Americas, (2) EMEA, (3) Asia Pacific, (4) Global Investment Management; and (5) Development Services.

1138118_18_ITEM8_P226_S0	In 2017, we changed the presentation of the operating results of one of our emerging businesses among our regional services reporting segments.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P226_S1	Prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current-year presentation.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P226_S2	This change had no impact on our consolidated results.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P227_S0	In 2017, we changed the presentation of the operating results of one of our emerging businesses among our regional services reporting segments.

1138118_18_ITEM8_P227_S2	This change had no impact on our consolidated results.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P228_S0	Adjusted EBITDA is the measure reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to each segment and assessing performance of each segment.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P228_S1	EBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P228_S2	the impact of certain cash and non-cash charges related to acquisitions, cost-elimination expenses and certain carried interest incentive compensation (reversal) expense to align with the timing of associated revenue.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P229_S0	Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
1138118_18_ITEM8_P230_S0	structure after several years of significant revenue and related cost growth.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P230_S1	Cost-elimination expenses incurred during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 consisted of $73.6 million and $32.6 million, respectively, of severance costs related to headcount reductions in connection with the program and $4.9 million and $7.8 million, respectively, of third-party contract termination costs.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P230_S2	The total amount for each period does have a cash impact.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P231_S0	Identifiable assets by segment are those assets used in our operations in each segment.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P231_S1	Corporate identifiable assets primarily include cash and cash equivalents available for general corporate use and net deferred tax assets.

1138118_18_ITEM8_P239_S0	Although CBRE Capital Markets is included among our domestic subsidiaries that jointly and severally guarantee our 5.00% senior notes, 4.875% senior notes, 5.25% senior notes and our 2015 Credit Agreement, a substantial majority of warehouse receivables funded under BofA, Fannie Mae ASAP, JP Morgan, Capital One and TD Bank lines of credit are pledged to BofA, Fannie Mae, JP Morgan, Capital One and TD Bank, and accordingly, are not included as collateral for these notes or our other outstanding debt.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P240_S0	In February 2018, we gave the notice required under the indenture governing our 5.00% senior notes of our intent to redeem such notes in full on March 15, 2018.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P240_S1	In connection with this early redemption, we will incur charges of $28.0 million, including a premium of $20.0 million and the write-off of $8.0 million of unamortized deferred financing costs.
1138118_18_ITEM8_P240_S2	We intend to fund this redemption with $550.0 million of borrowings from our tranche A term loan facility and borrowings from our revolving credit facility under the 2017 Credit Agreement as well as with cash on hand.
1138118_18_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Securities Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f), including maintenance of (i) records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets, and (ii) policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance that (a) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, (b) our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our board of directors and (c) we will prevent or timely detect unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1138118_18_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control.
1138118_18_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses of judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.
1138118_18_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper overriding of controls.
1138118_18_ITEM9A_P1_S3	As a result of such limitations, there is risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
1138118_18_ITEM9A_P1_S4	However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
1138118_18_ITEM9A_P1_S5	Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
1138118_18_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission.
1138118_18_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Based on our evaluation under the COSO framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017.
1138118_18_ITEM9A_P2_S2	The effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.
1138118_18_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Disclosure Controls and Procedures Rule 13a-15 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires that we conduct an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report, and we have a disclosure policy in furtherance of the same.
1138118_18_ITEM9A_P3_S1	This evaluation is designed to ensure that all corporate disclosure is complete and accurate in all material respects.
1138118_18_ITEM9A_P3_S2	The evaluation is further designed to ensure that all information required to be disclosed in our SEC reports is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods and in the manner specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
1138118_18_ITEM9A_P3_S3	Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
1138118_18_ITEM9A_P3_S4	Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer supervise and participate in this evaluation, and they are assisted by our Chief Accounting Officer and other members of our Disclosure Committee.
1138118_18_ITEM9A_P3_S5	In addition to our Chief Accounting Officer, our Disclosure Committee consists of our General Counsel, our chief communication officer, our corporate controller, our head of Global Assurance and Advisory, our senior officers of significant business lines and other select employees.
1138118_18_ITEM9A_P3_S6	We conducted the required evaluation, and our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined by Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) were effective as of December 31, 2017 to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level.
1138118_18_ITEM9A_P4_S0	No changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

1138118_18_ITEM15_P278_S0	See Number Available to Accept field on Merrill Lynch s award acceptance page (as available upon your acceptance of the terms of this Award Agreement).
1138118_18_ITEM15_P279_S0	Subject to Section 4 of the Agreement and the Change in Control Vesting section, below, the number of Units that will vest will be determined by applying the applicable percentage in the table below to the target number of Units awarded hereunder, based on the performance percentile ranking in the table:

1138118_18_ITEM15_P281_S1	For this purpose, growth determined on a cumulative basis will be calculated by determining the compound annual growth rate of Adjusted EPS for the Base Year that would generate the cumulative Adjusted EPS for the six years in the Performance Period.
1138118_18_ITEM15_P282_S0	Adjusted EPS means the Company s earnings per share, as adjusted for certain changes in accordance with the terms of the Plan, and publicly reported by the Company as EPS, as adjusted for each applicable period within the Performance Period.

1138118_18_ITEM15_P285_S1	Then, determine the rate of growth on a cumulative basis for the Performance Period ( Peer Cumulative EPS Growth Rate ).
1138118_18_ITEM15_P285_S2	For this purpose, growth determined on a cumulative basis will be calculated by determining the compound annual growth rate of each Peer s GAAP EPS for the Base Year that would generate the cumulative GAAP EPS for the six years in the Performance Period.
1138118_18_ITEM15_P286_S0	Peer Group means all companies and entities that, on the Grant Date, comprise the S P 500 and have a GAAP EPS for the Base Year that is greater than zero; provided , that, if a company or entity that is in the S P 500 on the Grant Date ceases to publicly report GAAP EPS and such company or entity has not become Insolvent (as defined below), such company or entity will be excluded from the ranking, provided further , that, if prior to the end of the Performance Period a company or entity that is in the S P 500 on the Grant Date becomes Insolvent, whether or not such company or entity continues to publicly report GAAP EPS, then such company or entity will be treated as having a Cumulative GAAP EPS Growth Rate of negative one hundred percent (-100%).
1138118_18_ITEM15_P286_S1	In addition, if a Peer is late in publicly reporting its GAAP EPS for its last quarter in the Performance Period and does not so report such GAAP EPS prior to the Certification Date, the Committee shall have discretion with respect to how the GAAP EPS of such Peer shall be determined with respect to such quarter for purposes of calculating its Peer Cumulative EPS Growth Rate.

1138118_18_ITEM15_P289_S0	THIRD : Rank the Company Cumulative EPS Growth Rate and the Peer Cumulative EPS Growth Rates determined in the first and second steps from low to high (with the company or entity with the lowest growth rate being ranked number 1, the company or entity with the second lowest growth rate ranked number 2, and so on) and determine the Company s percentile rank based upon its position in the list by dividing the Company s position by the sum of (i) one and (ii) the total number of members of the Peer Group and rounding the quotient to the nearest hundredth.
1138118_18_ITEM15_P290_S0	FOURTH : Plot the percentile rank for the Company determined in the third step into the appropriate band in the left-hand column of the table above and determine the number of Units vesting by applying the applicable percentage in the right-hand column to the total target number of Units awarded hereunder.

1138118_18_ITEM15_P293_S0	Any Units that do not vest are automatically forfeited, effective as of the last day of the Performance Period.
1138118_18_ITEM15_P294_S0	If a Change in Control occurs during the Performance Period, then the above calculations will be conducted as though the last day of the Performance Period were the most recently-reported quarter end of the Company and each Peer prior to the closing date of the Change in Control.
1138118_18_ITEM15_P294_S1	The number of Units resulting from such calculation shall be the number in which you are eligible to vest, and the vesting date shall be December 31, 2023, subject to your Continuous Service through such date; provided , that, if your Continuous Service is terminated after the Change in Control and prior to December 31, 2023 (x) by the Company without Cause, by you for Good Reason or due to your death or Disability (as defined in the Executive Severance Plan), then you shall vest in such resulting number of Units on the date of such termination or (y) due to your Retirement on or after the first anniversary of the Grant Date, then you shall vest in such resulting number of Units as is determined pursuant to Section 4(a) of the Award Agreement.
