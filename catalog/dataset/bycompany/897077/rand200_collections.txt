897077_11_ITEM1_P59_S0	While the Company believes that the end-users of its products evaluate their purchases on the basis of price, reputation and product quality, such purchases are also based on a dealer s service, support of and loyalty to the dealer based on previous purchase experiences, as well as other factors such as product and replacement part availability.

897077_11_ITEM1_P62_S0	Seasonality The Company s sales, both product and spare parts, are generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year, because a substantial number of the Company s products are used for maintenance activities such as vegetation maintenance, highway right-of-way maintenance, construction, and street and parking lot sweeping.
897077_11_ITEM1_P62_S1	Usage of this equipment is lower in harsh weather.
897077_11_ITEM1_P63_S0	The Company utilizes a rolling twelve-month sales forecast provided by the Company s marketing departments and order backlog in order to develop a production plan for its manufacturing facilities.
897077_11_ITEM1_P63_S1	In addition, many of the Company s marketing departments attempt to equalize demand for products throughout the calendar year by offering seasonal sales programs which may provide additional incentives, including discounts and extended payment terms, under these programs.
897077_11_ITEM1_P64_S0	The Company s products are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world.
897077_11_ITEM1_P64_S1	The principal competitive factors are price, quality, availability, service and reputation.
897077_11_ITEM1_P64_S2	The Company competes with several large national and international companies that offer a broad range of equipment and replacement parts, as well as with numerous small, privately-held manufacturers and suppliers of a limited number of products, mainly on a regional basis.
897077_11_ITEM1_P64_S3	Some of the Company s competitors are significantly larger than the Company and have substantially greater financial and other resources at their disposal.
897077_11_ITEM1_P64_S4	The Company believes that it is able to compete successfully in its markets by effectively managing its manufacturing costs, offering high quality products, developing and designing innovative products and, to some extent, avoiding direct competition with significantly larger potential competitors.
897077_11_ITEM1_P64_S5	There can be no assurance that the Company s competitors will not substantially increase the resources devoted to the development and marketing of products competitive with the Company s products or that new competitors with greater resources will not enter the Company s markets.

897077_11_ITEM1_P65_S1	The 37% increase was primarily due to the positive impact of improved agricultural market conditions on Bush Hog and Rhino backlogs.
897077_11_ITEM1_P66_S0	The Company continues to be affected by soft market conditions in its Industrial and European divisions due to the downturn in the global economy.
897077_11_ITEM1_P66_S1	Management expects that substantially all of the Company s backlog as of December 31, 2010 will be shipped during fiscal year 2011.
897077_11_ITEM1_P67_S0	The amount of unfilled orders at a particular time is affected by a number of factors, including manufacturing and shipping schedules which, in most instances, are dependent on the Company s seasonal sales programs and the requirements of its customers.
897077_11_ITEM1_P67_S1	Certain of the Company s orders are subject to cancellation at any time before shipment; therefore, a comparison of unfilled orders from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of future actual shipments.

897077_11_ITEM1_P79_S0	The Company knows that Bush Hog s main manufacturing property in Selma, Alabama was contaminated with chlorinated volatile organic compounds which most likely resulted from painting and cleaning operations during the 1960s and 70s.

897077_11_ITEM1_P79_S2	Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, Bush Hog s prior owner agreed to and has removed the underground storage tanks at its cost and has remedied the identified contamination in accordance with the regulations of the Alabama Department of Environmental Management.

897077_11_ITEM1_P80_S2	However, such estimates are difficult to determine, including the timing of such costs.

897077_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, certain financial data:
897077_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	The Company s net sales in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 ( 2010 ) were $524,540,000, an increase of $78,053,000 or 17.5% compared to $446,487,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 ( 2009 ).
897077_11_ITEM7_P2_S1	The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of the results of Bush Hog which was acquired in October 2009.
897077_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	North American Industrial sales (net) were $192,379,000 in 2010 compared to $173,905,000 in 2009, an increase of $18,474,000 or 10.6%.
897077_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	The increase resulted from higher sales of replacement parts and, to a lesser extent, a slight improvement in sales of excavator, vacuum truck, sweeper and mowing equipment products.
897077_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	Governmental entities continue to be affected by budget constraints and revenue shortfalls.
897077_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	Compared to 2009, sales to state agencies remained steadier than those to cities and counties.
897077_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	North American Agricultural sales (net) were $173,464,000 in 2010 compared to $92,415,000 in 2009, representing an increase of $81,049,000 or 87.7%.
897077_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Bush Hog, which contributed $78,030,000 of the increase.
897077_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	The agricultural market was soft during the first six months of 2010 due to the weakness in the overall economy, leading to dealer reluctance to stock farm equipment.
897077_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	During the third quarter of 2010, market conditions reflected some improvement due to increases in commodity prices and growth in farm income.
897077_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	European sales (net) decreased $21,470,000 or 11.9% to $158,697,000 in 2010 compared to $180,167,000 in 2009.
897077_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	This decrease was mainly due to soft market conditions caused by the slowdown in the European economy.
897077_11_ITEM7_P7_S2	Specifically, our U.K. units held up better than our French operations, which were responsible for the majority of the decrease.
897077_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	The agricultural market in Europe showed more improvement in 2010 than the governmental market.
897077_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	The European sales in 2010 had a lagging effect from what we saw in the Company s North American markets.
897077_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	Gross margins for 2010 were $116,914,000 (22.3% of net sales) compared to $94,561,000 (21.2% of net sales) in 2009, an increase of $22,353,000.
897077_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	The majority of the increase was due to the acquisition of Bush Hog , which accounts for $20,271,000 of the increase.
897077_11_ITEM7_P9_S2	Increases in the Company s replacement part business supported higher margins as well as improved margin percentages.
897077_11_ITEM7_P9_S3	Margin percentages also improved over 2009 as a result of ongoing cost savings initiatives which helped lower manufacturing costs.
897077_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG A ) were $86,041,000 (16.4% of net sales) in 2010 compared to $76,100,000 (17.0% of net sales) in 2009.
897077_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	The increase of $9,941,000 in SG A in 2010 was due to the acquisition of Bush Hog which added a net increase of $11,799,000.
897077_11_ITEM7_P10_S2	Without Bush Hog expenses in 2010 and 2009 along with acquisition costs related to Bush Hog in 2009, SG A expenses were relatively flat year over year.
897077_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	The Company recorded a $27,689,000 bargain purchase gain during the fourth quarter of 2009 which has since been adjusted to $30,177,000 as a result of retrospective adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed since the date of acquisition.
897077_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	The purchase price consideration was 1,700,000 unregistered shares of Alamo Group stock at a closing price of $16.09 per share plus the assumption of certain liabilities and other considerations.
897077_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	There was no goodwill impairment for 2010 compared to non-cash $14,104,000 impairment in 2009.
897077_11_ITEM7_P12_S1	In 2009, the Company wrote off the goodwill at Gradall/VacAll and just over 75% of the goodwill at Nite-Hawk in its Industrial Division after performing its required impairment test.
897077_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	Interest expense for 2010 was $3,664,000 compared to $4,766,000 in 2009, a $1,102,000 or a 23.1% decrease.
897077_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	The decrease was due to reduced borrowings in 2010 compared to 2009.
897077_11_ITEM7_P13_S2	The 2010 interest expense includes $375,000 in amortization of bank fees from the amendment to the Company s revolving credit agreement in November 2009.
897077_11_ITEM7_P13_S3	In 2009, the Company amortized $63,000 in bank fees relating to the same amendment.
897077_11_ITEM7_P13_S4	Other income net, was $290,000 during 2010 compared to income of $625,000 in 2009.
897077_11_ITEM7_P13_S5	The gains in both 2010 and 2009 are entirely from changes in exchange rates.
897077_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	Provision for Income Taxes was $7,915,000 (27.3% of income before income taxes) for 2010 compared to $12,473,000 (40.1% of income before income taxes) in 2009.
897077_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	Included in the 2010 tax provision is an $898,000 tax credit related to prior years research and development expenses.
897077_11_ITEM7_P14_S2	The increase in the effective tax rate for 2009 was from increased state taxes in the United States and from the non-deductible tax write-off of goodwill in the Industrial Division.
897077_11_ITEM7_P14_S3	Net Income for 2010 was $21,117,000 compared to $18,633,000 in 2009 due to the factors described above.
897077_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	The Company s net sales in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 ( 2009 ) were $446,487,000, a decrease of $110,648,000 or 19.9% compared to $557,135,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008 ( 2008 ).
897077_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	The decrease was primarily attributable to the general weakness in the worldwide economy which began in the fourth quarter of 2008 and continues to affect the markets the Company serves.
897077_11_ITEM7_P15_S2	The acquisitions of Rivard and Bush Hog were accretive to the Company s sales for 2009.
897077_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	North American Industrial sales (net) were $173,905,000 in 2009 compared to $254,787,000 in 2008, an $80,882,000 or 31.7% decrease.
897077_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	The decrease came from lower sales of excavator, vacuum truck, sweeper and mowing equipment as governmental entities continue to be affected by budget constraints and revenue shortfalls.
897077_11_ITEM7_P16_S2	Sales to cities and counties remained steadier than those to state agencies.
897077_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	North American Agricultural sales (net) were $92,415,000 in 2009 compared to $120,232,000 in 2008, representing a decrease of $27,817,000 or 23.1%.
897077_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	The decrease was due to market uncertainty and tighter credit as dealers were reluctant to stock inventory at historical levels.
897077_11_ITEM7_P17_S2	The acquisition of Bush Hog on October 22, 2009 added $10,863,000 in sales.
897077_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	European sales (net) decreased $1,949,000 or 1.1% to $180,167,000 in 2009 compared to $182,116,000 in 2008.
897077_11_ITEM7_P18_S1	This decrease was mainly due to changes in the exchange rates and softness in the French markets and to a lesser extent was offset by higher export sales outside our core markets.
897077_11_ITEM7_P18_S2	The Rivard acquisition added $23,858,000 to sales for 2009.
897077_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	Gross margins for 2009 were $94,561,000 (21.2% of net sales) compared to $109,414,000 (19.6% of net sales) in 2008, a decrease of $14,853,000.
897077_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	The decrease was due to reduced sales during 2009, which was somewhat offset by the Rivard acquisition.
897077_11_ITEM7_P19_S2	Gross margin percentages improved over 2008 as a result of favorable pricing in both raw and purchase components and continued improvement in efficiency initiatives.
897077_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG A ) were $76,100,000 (17.0% of net sales) in 2009 compared to $83,059,000 (14.9% of net sales) in 2008.
897077_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	The decrease of $6,959,000 in SG A in 2009 primarily came from reductions in workforce net of $1,158,000 in severance costs, lower insurance premiums and professional fees, and reduced commissions from lower sales volumes.
897077_11_ITEM7_P20_S2	Bush Hog acquisition costs were $828,000 in 2009 and, during the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company also incurred $1,383,000 at Bush Hog relating to severance and restructuring costs.

897077_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	Interest expense for 2009 was $4,766,000 compared to $7,450,000 in 2008, a $2,684,000 or a 36% decrease.
897077_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	The decrease was due primarily to reduced borrowings along with lower interest rates in 2009.
897077_11_ITEM7_P23_S2	Other income net, was $625,000 during 2009 compared to income of $1,513,000 in 2008.
897077_11_ITEM7_P23_S3	The gains in both 2009 and 2008 are entirely from changes in exchange rates.

897077_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	The increase in the effective tax rate for 2009 was from increased state taxes in the United States and from the non-deductible tax write-off of goodwill in the Industrial Division.
897077_11_ITEM7_P24_S2	Net Income for 2009 was $18,633,000 compared to $10,999,000 in 2008 due to the factors described above.
897077_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	In addition to normal operating expenses, the Company has ongoing cash requirements which are necessary to conduct the Company s business, including inventory purchases and capital expenditures.
897077_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	The Company s inventory and accounts payable levels, particularly in its North American Agricultural Division, build in the first quarter and early spring and, to a lesser extent, in the fourth quarter in anticipation of the spring and fall selling seasons.
897077_11_ITEM7_P25_S2	Accounts receivable historically build in the first and fourth quarters of each year as a result of pre-season sales.
897077_11_ITEM7_P25_S3	These sales help balance the Company s production during the first and fourth quarters.
897077_11_ITEM7_P25_S4	Some of the Company s recent acquisitions which are not involved in vegetation maintenance have helped to soften this seasonality pattern.
897077_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the Company had working capital of $185,871,000, which represents an increase of $1,960,000 from working capital of $183,911,000 as of December 31, 2009.
897077_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	The increase in working capital was primarily from higher accounts receivable in the Company s North American and European operations offset by decreases in inventory from reduced levels of activity.
897077_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	Capital expenditures were $4,980,000 for 2010, compared to $3,453,000 for 2009.
897077_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	For 2011, capital expenditures are expected to be higher compared to 2010 though still below depreciation levels.
897077_11_ITEM7_P27_S2	The Company expects to fund capital expenditures from operating cash flows or through its revolving credit facility, described below.
897077_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	The Company was authorized by its Board of Directors in 1997 to repurchase up to 1,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock to be funded through working capital and credit facility borrowings.
897077_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	There were no shares repurchased in 2009 or in 2010.
897077_11_ITEM7_P28_S2	The authorization to repurchase up to 1,000,000 shares remains available less 42,600 shares previously purchased.
897077_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	During the third quarter of 2010, the Company closed its manufacturing facility located in Orleans, France and incurred $924,000 in redundancy costs.

897077_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	The decrease of cash from operating activities resulted primarily from increased accounts receivable levels specifically in the Company s North American operations.
897077_11_ITEM7_P30_S2	The higher levels in 2009 were a result of greater inventory and accounts receivable reductions due to the market decline.
897077_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	Net cash used by financing activities was $26,013,000 for 2010, compared to net cash used of $56,965,000 for 2009.
897077_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	The decrease in financing activities in 2010 was from repayments of amounts borrowed from our bank credit facility due to cash provided by operating activities.
897077_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	On August 25, 2004, the Company entered into a five-year $70 million Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement with its lenders, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase Bank, and Guaranty Bank.
897077_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	This contractually-committed, unsecured facility allows the Company to borrow and repay amounts drawn at floating or fixed interest rates based upon Prime or LIBOR rates.

897077_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	Beginning June 30, 2009, Rivard s actual operating cash flow was used in the calculation of consolidated operating flow.
897077_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	On November 6, 2009, the Company entered into the Seventh Amendment of the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., BBVA Compass Bank, and Rabobank, as its lenders.

897077_11_ITEM7_P35_S3	The purpose of the amendment was to add Bush Hog as a member of the Obligated Group and pledge a first priority security interest in certain U.S. assets (accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, trademarks and trade names) of the Borrower and each member of the Obligated Group.
897077_11_ITEM7_P35_S4	The Lenders agreed to increase the operating leverage ratio during the next three quarters and to add a new EBIT to Interest Expense covenant in exchange for a commitment fee and an increase in the Applicable Interest Margin over LIBOR or Prime Rate advances.

897077_11_ITEM7_P37_S1	The facility was renewed effective October 29, 2010 and outstandings currently bear interest at Lloyd s Base Rate plus 1.4% per annum.
897077_11_ITEM7_P37_S2	The facility is unsecured but guaranteed by the U.K. subsidiaries of Alamo Group Europe Limited.
897077_11_ITEM7_P37_S3	As of December 31, 2010, there were no outstanding balances in British pounds borrowed against the U.K. overdraft facility.
897077_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	There are additional lines of credit: for the Company s French operations in the amount of 7,300,000 Euros, which includes the Rivard credit facilities; for our Canadian operation in the amount of 3,500,000 Canadian dollars; and for our Australian operation in the amount of 800,000 Australian dollars.

897077_11_ITEM7_P38_S2	The Canadian and Australian revolving credit facilities are guaranteed by the Company.
897077_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the Company is in compliance with the terms and conditions of its credit facilities.
897077_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	Management believes the bank credit facilities and the Company s ability to internally generate funds from operations should be sufficient to meet the Company s cash requirements for the foreseeable future.
897077_11_ITEM7_P40_S1	However, the challenges affecting the banking industry and credit markets in general can potentially cause changes to credit availability which creates a level of uncertainty.
897077_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	The Company believes that inflation generally has not had a material impact on its operations or liquidity.
897077_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	The Company is exposed to the risk that the price of energy, steel and other purchased components may increase and the Company may not be able to increase the price of its products correspondingly.
897077_11_ITEM7_P41_S2	If this occurs, the Company s results of operations would be adversely impacted.
897077_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Act ), which is a comprehensive health care reform bill for the United States.
897077_11_ITEM7_P42_S1	In addition, on March 30, 2010, President Obama signed into law the reconciliation measure ( Heath Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 ), which modifies certain provisions of the Act.
897077_11_ITEM7_P42_S2	Although the new legislation did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operation or cash flows in 2010, the Company is continuing to assess the potential impacts on our future obligations, costs and cash flows related to our health care benefits.
897077_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-17, Revenue Recognition (ASC Topic 605): Milestone Method ( ASU No. 2010-17 ).
897077_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	ASU No. 2010-17 recognizes the milestone method as an acceptable revenue recognition method for substantive milestones in research or development transactions.
897077_11_ITEM7_P43_S2	A milestone is substantive when the consideration earned from achievement of the milestone is commensurate with either (a) the vendor s performance to achieve the milestone or (b) the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the vendor s performance to achieve the milestone and the consideration earned from the achievement of a milestone relates solely to past performance and is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms (including other potential milestone consideration) within the arrangement.
897077_11_ITEM7_P43_S3	This new guidance will be effective for our fiscal year 2011 and its interim periods, with early adoption permitted.
897077_11_ITEM7_P43_S4	This guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
897077_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	In January 2010, the provisions of ASC Topic 820 were modified to require additional disclosures, including transfers in and out of Level 1 and 2 fair value measurements and the gross basis presentation of the reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements.
897077_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for disclosures related to Level 3 fair value measurements, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010 (including interim periods).
897077_11_ITEM7_P44_S2	We have adopted all of these provisions of ASC Topic 820 effective December 31, 2009.
897077_11_ITEM7_P44_S3	Since only disclosures are affected by these requirements, the adoption of these provisions will not affect our financial position or results of operations.
897077_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-14 Software (ASC Topic 985): Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements ( ASU No. 2009-14 ).
897077_11_ITEM7_P45_S1	ASU No. 2009-14 modifies the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance to exclude (i) non-software components of tangible products and (ii) software components of tangible products that are sold, licensed or leased with tangible products when the software components and non-software components of the tangible product function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality.
897077_11_ITEM7_P45_S2	ASU No. 2009-14 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010 with early adoption permitted.
897077_11_ITEM7_P45_S3	The guidance may be applied retrospectively or prospectively for new or materially modified arrangements.
897077_11_ITEM7_P45_S4	This guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
897077_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-13 Revenue Recognition (ASC Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements ( ASU No. 2009-13 ).
897077_11_ITEM7_P46_S1	ASU No. 2009-13 addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting.
897077_11_ITEM7_P46_S2	ASU No. 2009-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010 with early adoption permitted.
897077_11_ITEM7_P46_S3	The guidance may be applied retrospectively or prospectively for new or materially modified arrangements.
897077_11_ITEM7_P46_S4	This guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
897077_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	The Company does not have any obligation, under any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the Company is a party, that has or is reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
897077_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	The following table shows the Company s approximate obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010:
897077_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	Long-term debt obligation means a principal payment obligation under long-term borrowings.
897077_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	Capital lease obligation means a principal payment obligation under a lease classified as a capital lease.
897077_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	Interest obligation represents interest due on long-term debt and capital lease obligations.
897077_11_ITEM7_P51_S1	Interest on long-term debt assumes all floating rates of interest remain the same as those in effect at December 31, 2010 and include the effect of the Company s interest rate derivative arrangements on future cash payments for the remaining period of those derivatives.
897077_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	Operating lease obligation means a payment obligation under a lease classified as an operating lease.
897077_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	Purchase obligation means an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the registrant that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions.
897077_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	In addition, the Company sponsors various pension plans that may obligate it to make contributions from time to time.
897077_11_ITEM7_P54_S1	We expect to make a cash contribution to our pension plans in 2011 in the amount of $1.1 million.
897077_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ).
897077_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
897077_11_ITEM7_P55_S2	Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
897077_11_ITEM7_P55_S3	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
897077_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the financial statements.
897077_11_ITEM7_P56_S1	Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
897077_11_ITEM7_P56_S2	For further information on the critical accounting policies, see Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
897077_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	The Company evaluates the collectability of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors.
897077_11_ITEM7_P57_S1	In circumstances where it is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations, the Company records a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what it believes will be collected.
897077_11_ITEM7_P57_S2	For all other customers, it recognizes reserves for bad debt based on historical experience of bad debts as a percent of revenues for each business unit, adjusted for relative improvements or deteriorations in the aging and changes in current economic conditions.
897077_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	The Company evaluates all receivables that are over 60 days old and will reserve specifically on a 90-day basis.
897077_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	The Company has a secured interest on most of its wholegoods that each customer purchases.
897077_11_ITEM7_P59_S1	This allows the Company, in times of a difficult economy when the customer is unable to pay or has filed for bankruptcy (usually Chapter 11), to repossess the customer s inventory.
897077_11_ITEM7_P59_S2	This also allows Alamo Group to maintain only a reserve over its cost, which usually represents the margin on the original sales price.
897077_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $2,852,000 on December 31, 2010, and $2,548,000 on December 31, 2009.
897077_11_ITEM7_P60_S1	The increase was mainly from the Company s Agricultural operations.
897077_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	On December 31, 2010, the Company had $11,903,000 in reserves for sales discounts compared to $3,803,000 on December 31, 2009 on product shipped to our customers under various promotional programs.
897077_11_ITEM7_P61_S1	The increase was due primarily to increased sales volume of the Company s agricultural products during the pre-season, which runs from September to December of each year with orders shipped through the first quarter of 2011.
897077_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	The Company reviews the reserve quarterly based on analysis made on each program outstanding at the time.
897077_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	The Company bases its reserves on historical data relating to discounts taken by the customer under each program.
897077_11_ITEM7_P63_S1	Historically, between 85% and 95% of the Company s customers who qualify for each program actually take the discount that is available.
897077_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	The Company had a reserve of $7,506,000 on December 31, 2010 and $9,060,000 on December 31, 2009 to cover obsolete and slow moving inventory.
897077_11_ITEM7_P64_S1	The decrease in the reserve was mainly from the Company s U.S. operations, specifically its facilities in Gibson City and Indianola as a result of greater disposals and sales of slow moving and obsolete inventory.
897077_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	The obsolete and slow moving inventory policy states that the reserve is to be calculated as follows: 1) no inventory usage over a three-year period is deemed obsolete and reserved at 100 percent; and 2) slow moving inventory with little usage requires a 100 percent reserve on items that have a quantity greater than a three-year supply.
897077_11_ITEM7_P65_S1	There are exceptions to the obsolete and slow moving classifications if approved by an officer of the Company, based on specific identification of an item or items that are deemed to be either included or excluded from this classification.
897077_11_ITEM7_P65_S2	In cases where there is no historical data, management makes a judgment based on a specific review of the inventory in question to determine what reserves, if any, are appropriate.
897077_11_ITEM7_P65_S3	New products or parts are generally excluded from the reserve policy until a three-year history has been established.
897077_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	The reserve is reviewed and, if necessary, adjustments are made on a quarterly basis.
897077_11_ITEM7_P66_S1	The Company relies on historical information when available to support its reserve.
897077_11_ITEM7_P66_S2	The Company does not adjust the reserve balance until the inventory is liquidated.
897077_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	The Company s warranty policy is generally to provide its customers warranty for up to one year on all wholegood units and 90 days on parts.
897077_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	Warranty reserve, as a percentage of sales, is generally calculated by looking at the current twelve months expenses and prorating that amount based on twelve months sales with a ninety-day to six-month lag period.
897077_11_ITEM7_P68_S1	The Company s historical experience is that an end-user takes approximately 90 days to six months from the receipt of the unit to file a warranty claim.
897077_11_ITEM7_P68_S2	A warranty reserve is established for each different marketing group.
897077_11_ITEM7_P68_S3	Reserve balances are evaluated on a quarterly basis and adjustments made when required.
897077_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	The current liability warranty reserve balance was $5,554,000 on December 31, 2010 and $5,972,000 on December 31, 2009.
897077_11_ITEM7_P69_S1	The increase came mainly from the acquisition of Bush Hog.
897077_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	Goodwill must be tested for impairment at least annually.
897077_11_ITEM7_P70_S1	In the fourth quarter of each year, or when events and circumstances warrant such a review, the Company tests the goodwill of all of its reporting units for impairment.
897077_11_ITEM7_P70_S2	The goodwill impairment test is determined using a two-step process.
897077_11_ITEM7_P70_S3	The first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill (Step 1).
897077_11_ITEM7_P70_S4	If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step is not necessary.
897077_11_ITEM7_P70_S5	However, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step (Step 2) is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss to recognize, if any.
897077_11_ITEM7_P70_S6	Step 2 compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill.
897077_11_ITEM7_P70_S7	If the implied value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount of goodwill, then a charge is recorded to reduce goodwill to the implied goodwill.
897077_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	The implied goodwill is calculated based on a hypothetical purchase price allocation, in that it takes the implied fair value of the reporting unit and allocates such fair value to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit.
897077_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis.
897077_11_ITEM7_P72_S1	This analysis requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates.
897077_11_ITEM7_P72_S2	The cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of time, which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to an even higher degree of uncertainty.
897077_11_ITEM7_P72_S3	The Company also utilizes market valuation models and other financial ratios, which require the Company to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to its assets and businesses.
897077_11_ITEM7_P72_S4	The Company believes that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values of each of its reporting units are reasonable.
897077_11_ITEM7_P72_S5	However, different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value.
897077_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	As of December 31, 2010, goodwill was $34,073,000, which represents 9% of total assets.
897077_11_ITEM7_P73_S1	The Company recognized no goodwill impairment in 2010.
897077_11_ITEM7_P73_S2	The North American Industrial segment had a goodwill impairment of $14,104,000 in 2009.
897077_11_ITEM7_P73_S3	During the 2010 impairment analysis review, it was noted that even though the Schwarze reporting unit s fair value was above carrying value it was not materially different.
897077_11_ITEM7_P73_S4	On December 31, 2010, there was approximately $6.8 million of goodwill related to the Schwarze reporting unit.
897077_11_ITEM7_P73_S5	This reporting unit would be most likely affected by changes in the Company s assumptions and estimates.
897077_11_ITEM7_P73_S6	The calculation of fair value could increase or decrease depending on changes in the inputs and assumptions used, such as changes in the reporting unit s future growth rates, discount rates, etc.
897077_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding goodwill.
897077_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The Company is exposed to various financial market risks.
897077_11_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates.
897077_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The Company does not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
897077_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	International Sales A portion of the Company s operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities in international jurisdictions.
897077_11_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The Company primarily manufactures its products in the United States, the U.K., France, Canada and Australia.
897077_11_ITEM7A_P2_S2	The Company sells its products primarily within the markets where the products are produced, but certain of the Company s sales from its U.K. operations are denominated in other European currencies.
897077_11_ITEM7A_P2_S3	As a result, the Company s financials, specifically the value of its foreign assets, could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the other markets in which the subsidiaries of the Company distribute their products.
897077_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	To mitigate the short-term effect of changes in currency exchange rates on the Company s functional currency-based sales, the Company s U.K. subsidiaries regularly enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge over 90% of its future net foreign currency cash receipts over a period of six months.
897077_11_ITEM7A_P3_S1	As of December 31, 2010, the Company had $2,664,000 outstanding in forward exchange contracts related to accounts receivable.
897077_11_ITEM7A_P3_S2	A 15% fluctuation in exchange rates for these currencies would change the fair value by approximately $400,000.
897077_11_ITEM7A_P3_S3	However, since these contracts hedge foreign currency denominated transactions, any change in the fair value of the contracts should be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged.
897077_11_ITEM7A_P4_S0	On December 31, 2010, the fair value of these agreements was in an unfavorable position; therefore, the derivative financial instruments were recorded as a loss of $43,000, which has been recognized in other income (expense), net.
897077_11_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The Company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominantly in European countries, Canada and Australia, as a result of the sale of its products in international markets.
897077_11_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Foreign currency forward contracts in the U.K. are used to hedge against the earnings effects of such fluctuations.
897077_11_ITEM7A_P6_S0	On December 31, 2010, the result of a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies in which the Company s sales are denominated would result in a decrease in gross profit of $4,435,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010.
897077_11_ITEM7A_P6_S1	Comparatively, on December 31, 2009, the result of a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which the Company s sales are denominated would have resulted in a decrease in gross profit of approximately $4,891,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009.
897077_11_ITEM7A_P7_S0	This calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar.
897077_11_ITEM7A_P7_S1	In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, which are a changed dollar value of the resulting sales, changes in exchange rates may also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive.
897077_11_ITEM7A_P7_S2	The Company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices.
897077_11_ITEM7A_P7_S3	The translation adjustment during 2010 was a loss of $3,659,000.
897077_11_ITEM7A_P8_S0	On December 31, 2010, the British pound closed at .6411 relative to the U.S. dollar, and the Euro closed at .7479 relative to the U.S. dollar.
897077_11_ITEM7A_P8_S1	By comparison, on December 31, 2009, the British pound closed at .6187 relative to the U.S. dollar, and the Euro closed at .6985 relative to the U.S. dollar.
897077_11_ITEM7A_P8_S2	No assurance can be given as to future valuation of the British pound or Euro or how further movements in those or other currencies could affect future earnings or the financial position of the Company.
897077_11_ITEM7A_P9_S0	The majority of the Company s long-term debt bears interest at variable rates.
897077_11_ITEM7A_P9_S1	Accordingly, the Company s net income is affected by changes in interest rates.
897077_11_ITEM7A_P9_S2	Assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and a two hundred basis point change in the 2010 average interest rate under these borrowings, the Company s 2010 interest expense would have changed by approximately $420,000.
897077_11_ITEM7A_P10_S0	In the event of an adverse change in interest rates, management could take actions to mitigate its exposure.
897077_11_ITEM7A_P10_S1	Further, this analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment.
897077_11_ITEM7A_P10_S2	However, the challenges affecting the banking industry and credit markets in general can potentially cause changes to credit availability which creates a level of uncertainty.
897077_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	The financial statements and supplementary data described in Item 15 of this report and included on pages 44 through 74 of this report are incorporated herein by reference.
897077_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	An evaluation was carried out, under the supervision and with the participation of Alamo s management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), and Vice President and Corporate Controller (Principal Accounting Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933).

897077_11_ITEM15_P39_S1	The credit risk is limited because of the large numbers and types of customers and their geographic dispersion.

897077_11_ITEM15_P41_S1	Major renewals and betterments are charged to the property accounts while replacements, maintenance and repairs, which do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets, are expensed to the current period.
897077_11_ITEM15_P42_S0	Depreciation is provided at amounts calculated to amortize the cost of the assets over their estimated useful economic lives using the straight-line method.
897077_11_ITEM15_P43_S0	Goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of businesses acquired.
897077_11_ITEM15_P43_S1	In the fourth quarter of each year, or when events and circumstances warrant such a review, the Company tests the goodwill of all of its reporting units for impairment.
897077_11_ITEM15_P43_S2	The goodwill impairment test is determined using a two-step process.
897077_11_ITEM15_P43_S3	The first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill (Step 1).
897077_11_ITEM15_P43_S4	If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step is not necessary.
897077_11_ITEM15_P43_S5	However, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step (Step 2) is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss to recognize, if any.
897077_11_ITEM15_P43_S6	Step 2 compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill.
897077_11_ITEM15_P43_S7	If the implied value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount of goodwill, then a charge is recorded to reduce goodwill to the implied goodwill.
897077_11_ITEM15_P44_S0	The implied goodwill is calculated based on a hypothetical purchase price allocation, in that it takes the implied fair value of the reporting unit and allocates such fair value to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit.
897077_11_ITEM15_P45_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis.
897077_11_ITEM15_P45_S1	This analysis requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates.
897077_11_ITEM15_P45_S2	The cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of time, which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to an even higher degree of uncertainty.
897077_11_ITEM15_P45_S3	The Company also utilizes market valuation models and other financial ratios, which require the Company to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to its assets and businesses.
897077_11_ITEM15_P45_S4	The Company believes that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values of each of its reporting units are reasonable.
897077_11_ITEM15_P45_S5	However, different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value.
897077_11_ITEM15_P46_S0	As of December 31, 2010, goodwill was $34,073,000, which represents 9% of total assets.
897077_11_ITEM15_P46_S1	The Company recognized no goodwill impairment in 2010.
897077_11_ITEM15_P46_S2	The North American Industrial segment had a goodwill impairment of $14,104,000 in 2009.
897077_11_ITEM15_P46_S3	During the 2010 impairment analysis review, it was noted that even though the Schwarze reporting unit s fair value was above carrying value it was not materially different.
897077_11_ITEM15_P46_S4	On December 31, 2010, there was approximately $6.8 million of goodwill related to the Schwarze reporting unit.
897077_11_ITEM15_P46_S5	This reporting unit would be most likely affected by changes in the Company s assumptions and estimates.
897077_11_ITEM15_P46_S6	The calculation of fair value could increase or decrease depending on changes in the inputs and assumptions used, such as changes in the reporting unit s future growth rates, discount rates, etc.
897077_11_ITEM15_P47_S0	See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding goodwill.
897077_11_ITEM15_P48_S0	The Company s definite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of patents and trade names.

897077_11_ITEM15_P48_S2	Accumulated amortization of definite-lived intangible assets was $1,147,000 and $1,088,000 on December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

897077_11_ITEM15_P48_S4	During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company wrote off $224,000 in older patents which the Company believes no longer provide a competitive advantage.
897077_11_ITEM15_P48_S5	The net book value of the patents and trademarks was $5,500,000 and $5,803,000 as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
897077_11_ITEM15_P49_S0	Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives not subject to amortization consist of the Gradall trade name valued at $3,600,000 and the Bush Hog trade name valued at $1,900,000 on December 31, 2010.
897077_11_ITEM15_P50_S0	The Company tests its indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis at year-end, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset could be below its carrying amount.
897077_11_ITEM15_P50_S1	The impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, determined using the relief from royalty method, with its carrying amount.
897077_11_ITEM15_P50_S2	An impairment loss would be recognized for the carrying amount in excess of its fair value.
897077_11_ITEM15_P51_S0	Identifiable intangible assets are recorded at estimated cost.
897077_11_ITEM15_P51_S1	Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.

897077_11_ITEM15_P59_S0	Pre-season sales orders are solicited in the fall in advance of the dealer s sales season in the spring and summer.
897077_11_ITEM15_P59_S1	Pre-season sales orders are shipped beginning in the fall and continuing through the spring and represent an opportunity for the Company s factories to level their production/shipping volumes through the winter months.

897077_11_ITEM15_P60_S0	Revenue from sales is recorded net of a provision for discounts that are anticipated to be earned and deducted at time of payment by the customer.
897077_11_ITEM15_P60_S1	These approximated discounts represent an average of historical amounts taken and are adjusted as program terms are changed.
897077_11_ITEM15_P60_S2	The reserves for discounts are reviewed and adjusted quarterly.
897077_11_ITEM15_P60_S3	From time to time, revenue is recognized under a bill and hold arrangement.

897077_11_ITEM15_P68_S0	Federal Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to the future years in which deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized.
897077_11_ITEM15_P69_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.
897077_11_ITEM15_P69_S1	The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.
897077_11_ITEM15_P69_S2	Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.
897077_11_ITEM15_P69_S3	Based upon projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences.

897077_11_ITEM15_P70_S1	The earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, which reflect full provision for non-U.S. income taxes, are currently indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. operations.
897077_11_ITEM15_P71_S0	Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted the new provisions of ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, which address the recognition and measurement of (i) identifiable assets acquired or liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, and (ii) goodwill acquired or gain from a bargain purchase.
897077_11_ITEM15_P71_S1	In addition, acquisition-related costs are accounted for as expenses in the period in which the costs are incurred and the services are received.
897077_11_ITEM15_P71_S2	These provisions were applied to the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of Bush Hog LLC in the fourth quarter of 2009, which is discussed in Note 20.
897077_11_ITEM15_P72_S0	Effective January 1, 2006, we began using the modified-prospective transition method.
897077_11_ITEM15_P72_S1	However, for unvested equity awards outstanding as of the date of January 1, 2006, we continue to amortize those awards using the minimum value method.
897077_11_ITEM15_P73_S0	Beginning January 1, 2006 measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors is recognized based on estimated fair values.
897077_11_ITEM15_P74_S0	We use the Black-Scholes pricing model to determine the fair value of the stock options on the grant dates for stock awards made on or after January 1, 2006, and we amortize the fair value of share-based payments on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the award, which is generally the vesting period.
897077_11_ITEM15_P75_S0	The Black-Scholes valuation model requires us to make assumptions and judgments about the variables used in the calculation.
897077_11_ITEM15_P75_S1	These variables and assumptions include the fair value of our common stock, expected term, the expected volatility, the risk-free interest rate, expected dividends, and the estimated rate of forfeitures of unvested stock options.
897077_11_ITEM15_P76_S0	The Company calculated the fair value for options using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions for 2010, 2009, and 2008:
897077_11_ITEM15_P77_S0	In January 2010, the provisions of ASC Topic 820 were modified to require additional disclosures, including transfers in and out of Level 1 and 2 fair value measurements and the gross basis presentation of the reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements.
897077_11_ITEM15_P77_S1	This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for disclosures related to Level 3 fair value measurements, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010 (including interim periods).
897077_11_ITEM15_P77_S2	We have adopted all of these provisions of ASC Topic 820 effective December 31, 2009.
897077_11_ITEM15_P77_S3	Since only disclosures are affected by these requirements, the adoption of these provisions did not affect our financial position or results of operations.
897077_11_ITEM15_P78_S0	The following table sets forth the reconciliation from basic to diluted average common shares and the calculations of net income per common share.
897077_11_ITEM15_P78_S1	Net income for basic and diluted calculations does not differ.
897077_11_ITEM15_P79_S0	Stock options totaling 133,700 shares in 2010, 304,533 shares in 2009, and 188,523 shares in 2008 were not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
897077_11_ITEM15_P80_S0	3. VALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS Valuation and qualifying accounts included the following:
897077_11_ITEM15_P81_S0	The Company evaluates the collectability of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors.
897077_11_ITEM15_P81_S1	In circumstances where it is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations, the Company records a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what it believes will be collected.
897077_11_ITEM15_P81_S2	For all other customers, it recognizes reserves for bad debt based on historical experience of bad debts as a percent of revenues for each business unit, adjusted for relative improvements or deteriorations in the aging and changes in current economic conditions.
897077_11_ITEM15_P82_S0	The Company evaluates all receivables that are over 60 days old and will reserve specifically on a 90-day basis.
897077_11_ITEM15_P83_S0	The Company has a secured or insured interest on most of its wholegoods that each customer purchases.
897077_11_ITEM15_P83_S1	This allows the Company, in times of a difficult economy when the customer is unable to pay or has filed for bankruptcy (usually Chapter 11), to repossess the customer s inventory.
897077_11_ITEM15_P83_S2	This also allows Alamo Group to maintain only a reserve over its cost, which usually represents the margin on the original sales price.
897077_11_ITEM15_P84_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $2,852,000 on December 31, 2010, and $2,548,000 on December 31, 2009.
897077_11_ITEM15_P84_S1	The increase was mainly from the Company s Agricultural operations.
897077_11_ITEM15_P85_S0	On December 31, 2010, the Company had $11,903,000 in reserves for sales discounts compared to $3,803,000 on December 31, 2009 on product shipped to our customers under various promotional programs.
897077_11_ITEM15_P85_S1	The increase was due primarily to higher sales activity of the Company s agricultural products during the pre-season, which runs from September to December of each year with orders shipped through the first quarter of 2011.
897077_11_ITEM15_P86_S0	The Company reviews the reserve quarterly based on analysis made on each program outstanding at the time.
897077_11_ITEM15_P87_S0	The Company bases its reserves on historical data relating to discounts taken by the customer under each program.
897077_11_ITEM15_P87_S1	Historically, between 85% and 95% of the Company s customers who qualify for each program actually take the discount that is available.
897077_11_ITEM15_P88_S0	The Company had a reserve of $7,506,000 on December 31, 2010 and $9,060,000 on December 31, 2009 to cover obsolete and slow moving inventory.
897077_11_ITEM15_P88_S1	The decrease in the reserve was mainly from the Company s U.S. operations, specifically its facilities in Gibson City and Indianola as a result of greater disposals and sales of slow moving and obsolete inventory.
897077_11_ITEM15_P89_S0	The obsolete and slow moving inventory policy states that the reserve is to be calculated as follows: 1) no inventory usage over a three-year period is deemed obsolete and reserved at 100 percent; and 2) slow moving inventory with little usage requires a 100 percent reserve on items that have a quantity greater than a three-year supply.
897077_11_ITEM15_P89_S1	There are exceptions to the obsolete and slow moving classifications if approved by an officer of the Company, based on specific identification of an item or items that are deemed to be either included or excluded from this classification.
897077_11_ITEM15_P89_S2	In cases where there is no historical data, management makes a judgment based on a specific review of the inventory in question to determine what reserves, if any, are appropriate.
897077_11_ITEM15_P89_S3	New products or parts are generally excluded from the reserve policy until a three-year history has been established.
897077_11_ITEM15_P90_S0	The Company s warranty policy is generally to provide its customers warranty for up to one year on all wholegood units and 90 days on parts.
897077_11_ITEM15_P91_S0	Warranty reserve, as a percentage of sales, is generally calculated by looking at the current twelve months expenses and prorating that amount based on twelve months sales with a ninety-day to six-month lag period.
897077_11_ITEM15_P91_S1	The Company s historical experience is that an end-user takes approximately 90 days to six months from the receipt of the unit to file a warranty claim.
897077_11_ITEM15_P91_S2	A warranty reserve is established for each different marketing group.
897077_11_ITEM15_P91_S3	Reserve balances are evaluated on a quarterly basis and adjustments made when required.
897077_11_ITEM15_P92_S0	The current liability warranty reserve balance was $5,554,000 on December 31, 2010 and $5,972,000 on December 31, 2009.
897077_11_ITEM15_P92_S1	The decrease came mainly from the acquisition of Bush Hog .
897077_11_ITEM15_P93_S0	Inventories valued at LIFO represented 63% of total inventory for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
897077_11_ITEM15_P93_S1	The excess of current costs over LIFO-valued inventories was $7,654,000 and $9,106,000 on December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively.
897077_11_ITEM15_P93_S2	The $1,452,000 decrease in LIFO reserve during 2010 came from reductions in inventory levels within U.S. operations.
897077_11_ITEM15_P93_S3	The impact of the application of the LIFO method on the Statement of Income for the years ended December 31, 2010, was a decrease to cost of sales of $1,452,000, and a decrease in 2009 of $3,685,000 and an increase in 2008 of $3,729,000.
897077_11_ITEM15_P93_S4	Inventories consisted of the following on a cost basis, net of reserves:
897077_11_ITEM15_P94_S0	Property, plant and equipment consist of the following:
897077_11_ITEM15_P95_S0	Property, plant and equipment on December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 include $16,955,000 and $18,364,000, respectively, for items listed above that are held under capital leases.
897077_11_ITEM15_P95_S1	Accumulated depreciation relating to the capital leases on December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $7,428,000 and $7,233,000, respectively.
897077_11_ITEM15_P95_S2	Amortization related to the capital lease is included in depreciation expense.
897077_11_ITEM15_P96_S0	The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010 are as follows:
897077_11_ITEM15_P97_S0	Accrued liabilities consist of the following balances:
897077_11_ITEM15_P98_S0	The components of long-term debt are as follows:
897077_11_ITEM15_P99_S0	On August 25, 2004, the Company entered into a five-year $70 million Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement with its lenders, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase Bank, and Guaranty Bank.
897077_11_ITEM15_P99_S1	This contractually-committed, unsecured facility allows the Company to borrow and repay amounts drawn at floating or fixed interest rates based upon Prime or LIBOR rates.
897077_11_ITEM15_P99_S2	Proceeds may be used for general corporate purposes or, subject to certain limitations, acquisitions.
897077_11_ITEM15_P99_S3	The loan agreement contains among other things the following financial covenants: Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratios, Minimum Consolidated Tangible Net Worth, Consolidated Funded Debt to EBITDA Ratio and Minimum Asset Coverage Ratio, along with limitations on dividends, other indebtedness, liens, investments and capital expenditures.
897077_11_ITEM15_P100_S0	On October 14, 2008, the Company entered into the Sixth Amendment and Waiver under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement.
897077_11_ITEM15_P100_S1	The purpose of the amendment and waiver was to clarify company names within the Obligated Group after merging or dissolving some subsidiaries, to define operating cash flow and defining quarterly operating cash flow for Rivard through March 31, 2009.
897077_11_ITEM15_P100_S2	Beginning June 30, 2009, Rivard s actual operating cash flow will be used in the calculation of consolidated operating cash flow.
897077_11_ITEM15_P101_S0	On November 6, 2009, the Company entered into the Seventh Amendment of the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., BBVA Compass Bank, and Rabobank, as its lenders.
897077_11_ITEM15_P101_S1	The revolving credit line remained at $125.0 million.
897077_11_ITEM15_P101_S2	Prior to the execution of this Amendment, BBVA Compass Bank acquired certain assets of Guaranty Bank which included this credit facility, and JPMorgan Chase Bank assigned its interest to Well Fargo Bank, N.A.
897077_11_ITEM15_P101_S3	The purpose of the amendment was to add Bush Hog as a member of the Obligated Group and pledge a first priority security interest in certain U.S. assets (accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, trademarks and trade names) of the Borrower and each member of the Obligated Group.
897077_11_ITEM15_P101_S4	The Lenders agreed to increase the operating leverage ratio during the next three quarters and to add a new EBIT to Interest Expense covenant in exchange for a commitment fee and an increase in the Applicable Interest Margin over LIBOR or Prime Rate advances.
897077_11_ITEM15_P102_S0	As of December 31, 2010, there was $21,000,000 borrowed under the revolving credit facility.
897077_11_ITEM15_P102_S1	On December 31, 2010, $833,000 of the revolver capacity was committed to irrevocable standby letters of credit issued in the ordinary course of business as required by vendors contracts resulting in approximately $103,000,000 in available borrowings.
897077_11_ITEM15_P103_S0	On May 13, 2008, Alamo Group Europe Limited expanded its overdraft facility with Lloyd s TSB Bank plc from 1.0 million to 5.5 million.
897077_11_ITEM15_P103_S1	The facility was renewed on October 29, 2010 and outstandings currently bear interest at Lloyd s Base Rate plus 1.4% per annum.
897077_11_ITEM15_P103_S2	The facility is unsecured but guaranteed by the U.K. subsidiaries of Alamo Group Europe Limited.
897077_11_ITEM15_P103_S3	As of December 31, 2010, there were no outstanding balances in British pounds borrowed against the U.K. overdraft facility.
897077_11_ITEM15_P104_S0	There are additional lines of credit: for the Company s French operations in the amount of 7,300,000 Euros, which includes the Rivard credit facilities; for our Canadian operation in the amount of 3,500,000 Canadian dollars; and for our Australian operation in the amount of 800,000 Australian dollars.
897077_11_ITEM15_P104_S1	As of December 31, 2010, no Euros were borrowed against the French line of credit; no Canadian dollars were outstanding on the Canadian line of credit; and 600,000 Australian dollars were outstanding under its facility.
897077_11_ITEM15_P104_S2	The Canadian and Australian revolving credit facilities are guaranteed by the Company.
897077_11_ITEM15_P104_S3	The Company s borrowing levels for working capital are seasonal with the greatest utilization generally occurring in the first quarter and early spring.
897077_11_ITEM15_P105_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the Company is in compliance with the terms and conditions of its credit facilities.
897077_11_ITEM15_P106_S0	The aggregate maturities of long-term debt, as of December 31, 2010, are as follows: $2,319,000 in 2011; $21,477,000 in 2012; $499,000 in 2013; $336,000 in 2014; $242,000 in 2015; and $552,000 thereafter.
897077_11_ITEM15_P107_S0	The fair value of the Company s debt is based on secondary market indicators.
897077_11_ITEM15_P107_S1	Since the Company s debt is not quoted, estimates are based on each obligation s characteristics, including remaining maturities, interest rate, credit rating, collateral, amortization schedule and liquidity.
897077_11_ITEM15_P107_S2	The carrying amount approximates fair value.
897077_11_ITEM15_P108_S0	DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING Most of the Company s outstanding debt is advanced from a revolving credit facility that accrues interest at a contractual margin over current market interest rates.
897077_11_ITEM15_P108_S1	The Company s financing costs associated with this credit facility can materially change with market increases and decreases of short-term borrowing rates, specifically London Inter Bank Operating Rate ( LIBOR ).
897077_11_ITEM15_P109_S0	During the second quarter of 2007, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements with JPMorgan that hedge future cash flows related to its outstanding debt obligations.
897077_11_ITEM15_P109_S1	One swap had a three-year term and fixed the LIBOR base rate at 4.910% covering $20 million of this debt which expired on March 31, 2010.
897077_11_ITEM15_P109_S2	The other swap has a four-year term and fixed the LIBOR base rate at 4.935% covering an additional $20 million of these variable rate borrowings and expires on March 31, 2011.
897077_11_ITEM15_P109_S3	On November 5, 2009, JPMorgan transferred the swap transactions to Bank of America.
897077_11_ITEM15_P109_S4	The terms of the hedging instrument remain the same.
897077_11_ITEM15_P110_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the Company had $21 million outstanding under its revolving credit facility and one interest rate swap contract designated as cash flow hedge which is effectively hedging $20 million of these borrowings from changes in underlying LIBOR base rates.
897077_11_ITEM15_P110_S1	The fair market value of this hedge, which is the amount that would have been paid or received by the Company had it prematurely terminated this swap contract at December 31, 2010, was a $231,000 liability.
897077_11_ITEM15_P110_S2	This is included in Accrued liabilities with an offset in Accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes.
897077_11_ITEM15_P111_S0	At December 31, 2010, ineffectiveness related to the interest rate swap agreement was not material.
897077_11_ITEM15_P112_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
897077_11_ITEM15_P113_S0	There is a three-tier fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs used in valuation techniques.
897077_11_ITEM15_P113_S1	Observable inputs (highest level) reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs (lowest level) reflect internally developed market assumptions.
897077_11_ITEM15_P113_S2	In Fair value measurements are classified under the following hierarchy:
897077_11_ITEM15_P114_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
897077_11_ITEM15_P115_S0	Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs or significant value-drivers are observable in active markets.
897077_11_ITEM15_P116_S0	When available, the Company uses quoted market prices to determine fair value, and the Company classifies such measurements within Level 1.
897077_11_ITEM15_P116_S1	In some cases where market prices are not available, the Company makes use of observable market-based inputs to calculate fair value, in which case the measurements are classified with Level 2.
897077_11_ITEM15_P117_S0	If quoted or observable market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that use, where possible, current market-based parameters such as interest rates, yield curves, currency rates, etc.
897077_11_ITEM15_P117_S1	These measurements are classified within Level 3.
897077_11_ITEM15_P118_S0	Fair value measurements are classified to the lowest level input or value-driver that is significant to the valuation.
897077_11_ITEM15_P118_S1	A measurement may therefore be classified within Level 3 even though there may be significant inputs that are readily observable.
897077_11_ITEM15_P119_S0	The fair value of interest rate swap derivatives is primarily based on third-party pricing service models.
897077_11_ITEM15_P119_S1	These models use discounted cash flows that utilize the appropriate market-based forward swap curves and zero-coupon interest rates.
897077_11_ITEM15_P119_S2	Interest rate swap derivatives are Level 2 measurements and have a fair value of $231,000 in a liability position as of December 31, 2010.
897077_11_ITEM15_P120_S0	The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is based on a valuation model that discounts cash flows resulting from the differential between the contract price and the market-based forward rate and is a Level 2 measurement and has a fair value of $43,000 in a liability position as of December 31, 2010.
897077_11_ITEM15_P121_S0	The jurisdictional components of income before taxes consist of the following:
897077_11_ITEM15_P122_S0	The components of income tax expense (benefit) consist of the following:
897077_11_ITEM15_P123_S0	The difference between income tax expense (benefit) for financial statement purposes and the amount of income tax expense computed by applying the domestic statutory income tax rate of 34% to income loss before income taxes consist of the following:
897077_11_ITEM15_P124_S0	Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis.
897077_11_ITEM15_P124_S1	The components of the Company s deferred income tax assets and liabilities consist of the following:
897077_11_ITEM15_P125_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the Company had foreign deferred tax assets consisting of foreign net operating losses and other tax benefits available to reduce future taxable income in a foreign jurisdiction.
897077_11_ITEM15_P126_S0	The net operating loss ( NOL ) has an unlimited carry-forward.
897077_11_ITEM15_P127_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
897077_11_ITEM15_P127_S1	Based on the expectation of future taxable income and that the deductible temporary differences will offset existing taxable temporary differences, the Company believes it is more likely than not that it will realize the benefits of these deductible differences.
897077_11_ITEM15_P128_S0	Deferred income taxes have not been provided on the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases of the Company s foreign subsidiaries, based on the determination that such differences are essentially permanent in duration in that the earnings of the subsidiaries are expected to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations.
897077_11_ITEM15_P128_S1	As of December 31, 2010, the cumulative undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries approximated $102,223,000.
897077_11_ITEM15_P128_S2	If these earnings were not considered indefinitely reinvested, deferred income taxes would have been recorded after the consideration of foreign tax credits.
897077_11_ITEM15_P128_S3	At this time, it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional income taxes that might be payable on those earnings, if distributed.
897077_11_ITEM15_P129_S0	The Company adopted the provisions of FASB ASC Section 740-10-25 (formerly FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes ) on January 1, 2007.
897077_11_ITEM15_P129_S1	During 2009, the Company removed their liability for unrecognized tax positions after a reevaluation of the liabilities under the measurement criteria of ASC 740.
897077_11_ITEM15_P130_S0	During the third quarter of 2010, the Company completed a research and development credit study (R D study) related to prior year tax returns.
897077_11_ITEM15_P130_S1	The R D study resulted in tax credits of approximately $1,100,000.
897077_11_ITEM15_P130_S2	The Company has recorded an unrecognized tax benefit in the amount of $193,000 that if recognized would affect our annual effective tax rate.
897077_11_ITEM15_P130_S3	We do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next 12 months.
897077_11_ITEM15_P131_S0	The Company adopted the policy to include interest and penalty expense related to income taxes as interest and other expense, respectively.
897077_11_ITEM15_P131_S1	As of December 31, 2010, no interest or penalties has been or is required to be accrued.

897077_11_ITEM15_P149_S1	The measurement dates of the assets and liabilities of both plans were December 31 of the respective years presented.
897077_11_ITEM15_P150_S0	The Company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status (i.e., the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations) of defined benefit postretirement plans as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognized changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur.
897077_11_ITEM15_P150_S1	The Company measures the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year-end statement of financial position.
897077_11_ITEM15_P151_S0	The underfunded status of the plan of $7,151,000 and $7,640,000 as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, is recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as long-term accrued pension liability because plan assets are less than the value of benefit obligations expected to be paid.
897077_11_ITEM15_P152_S0	The accumulated benefit obligation for our pension plans represents the actuarial present value of benefits based on employee service and compensation as of a certain date and does not include an assumption about future compensation levels.
897077_11_ITEM15_P153_S0	In determining the projected benefit obligation and the net pension cost, we used the following significant weighted-average assumptions:
897077_11_ITEM15_P154_S0	Assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31:
897077_11_ITEM15_P155_S0	Assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December 31:
897077_11_ITEM15_P156_S0	The Company employs a building block approach in determining the expected long-term rate on return on plan assets.
897077_11_ITEM15_P156_S1	Historical markets are studied and long-term historical relationships between equities and fixed income are preserved consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run.
897077_11_ITEM15_P156_S2	Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term market assumptions are determined.
897077_11_ITEM15_P156_S3	The long-term portfolio return is established via a building block approach with proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing.
897077_11_ITEM15_P156_S4	Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness.
897077_11_ITEM15_P157_S0	The following tables present the components of net periodic benefit cost (gains are denoted with parentheses and losses are not):
897077_11_ITEM15_P158_S0	The Company estimates that $194,000 of unrecognized actuarial expense will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit costs during 2011.
897077_11_ITEM15_P159_S0	The Company employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk.
897077_11_ITEM15_P159_S1	Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condition.
897077_11_ITEM15_P160_S0	The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income investments.
897077_11_ITEM15_P160_S1	Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks, as well as growth, value, and small and large capitalizations.
897077_11_ITEM15_P160_S2	Other assets such as real estate, private equity, and hedge funds are used judiciously to enhance long-term returns while improving portfolio diversification.
897077_11_ITEM15_P160_S3	Derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely manner; however, derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of the underlying investments.
897077_11_ITEM15_P161_S0	Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements, and periodic asset/liability studies.
897077_11_ITEM15_P162_S0	The pension plans' weighted-average asset allocations as a percentage of plan assets at December 31 are as follows:
897077_11_ITEM15_P163_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we used the following valuation techniques to measure fair value for assets.
897077_11_ITEM15_P163_S1	There were no changes to these methodologies during 2010: Level 1 - Assets were valued using the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual security was traded.
897077_11_ITEM15_P163_S2	Level 2 - Assets were valued using quoted prices in markets that are not active, broker dealer quotations, net asset value of shares held by the plans, and other methods by which all significant input were observable at the measurement date.
897077_11_ITEM15_P163_S3	Level 3 - Assets were valued using valuation reports from the respective institutions at the measurement date.
897077_11_ITEM15_P163_S4	The following table presents the hierarchy levels for our postretirement benefit plan investments as of December 31, 2010:
897077_11_ITEM15_P164_S0	Our interests in the common collective trust investments are managed by one custodian.
897077_11_ITEM15_P164_S1	Consistent with our investment strategy, the custodian has invested the assets across a widely diversified portfolio of U.S. and international equity and fixed income securities.
897077_11_ITEM15_P164_S2	Fair values of each security within the collective trust as of December 31, 2010 were obtained from the custodian and are based on quoted market prices of individual investments; however, since the fund itself does not have immediate liquidity or a quoted market price, these assets are considered Level 2.
897077_11_ITEM15_P165_S0	Expected benefit payments are estimated using the same assumptions used in determining our benefit obligation as of December 31, 2010.
897077_11_ITEM15_P165_S1	The following table illustrates the estimated pension benefit payments which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, that are projected to be paid:

897077_11_ITEM15_P168_S0	A U.S. subsidiary of the Company had an Hourly Employee Pension Plan of Trust covering collective bargaining which was terminated on December 31, 2006.
897077_11_ITEM15_P168_S1	As of January 1, 2006 the employees were added to the existing 401(k) retirement and salary plan.
897077_11_ITEM15_P169_S0	Three of the Company s international subsidiaries also participate in a defined contribution and savings plan covering eligible employees.
897077_11_ITEM15_P169_S1	The Company s international subsidiaries contribute between 3% and 7.5% of the participant s salary up to a specific limit.
897077_11_ITEM15_P169_S2	Total contributions made to the above plan were $607,000, $537,000, and $620,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

897077_11_ITEM15_P179_S1	New purchase obligations should be received and paid for during the current fiscal year.
897077_11_ITEM15_P180_S0	The Company is subject to various unresolved legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of its business.
897077_11_ITEM15_P180_S1	The most significant of such actions relates to product liability, which is generally covered by insurance after various self-insured retention ( SIR ) amounts.
897077_11_ITEM15_P180_S2	While amounts claimed might be substantial and the liability with respect to such litigation cannot be determined at this time, the Company believes that the outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations; however, the ultimate resolution cannot be determined at this time.
897077_11_ITEM15_P181_S0	The Company is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations concerning air emissions, discharges into waterways, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials.
897077_11_ITEM15_P181_S1	The Company s policy is to comply with all applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and the Company believes it is currently in material compliance with all such applicable laws and regulations.
897077_11_ITEM15_P181_S2	These laws and regulations are constantly changing, and it is impossible to predict with accuracy the effect that changes to such laws and regulations may have on the Company in the future.
897077_11_ITEM15_P182_S0	Like other industrial concerns, the Company s manufacturing operations entail the risk of noncompliance, and there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur material costs or other liabilities as a result thereof.
897077_11_ITEM15_P183_S0	The Company knows that its Indianola, Iowa property is contaminated with chromium which most likely resulted from chrome plating operations which were discontinued before the Company purchased the property.
897077_11_ITEM15_P183_S1	Chlorinated volatile organic compounds have also been detected in water samples on the property, though the source is unknown at this time.
897077_11_ITEM15_P183_S2	The Company voluntarily worked with an environmental consultant and the state of Iowa with respect to these issues and believes it completed its remediation program in June 2006.

897077_11_ITEM15_P184_S1	Three specific remediation projects that were identified prior to the acquisition are in process of remediation with a remaining reserve balance of $30,000.
897077_11_ITEM15_P185_S0	The Company has a reserve of $277,000 concerning a potential asbestos issue that is expected to be abated over time.
897077_11_ITEM15_P185_S1	The balance of the reserve, $1,188,000, is mainly for potential ground water contamination/remediation that was identified before the acquisition and believed to have been generated by a third party company located near the Gradall facility.
897077_11_ITEM15_P186_S0	The company knows that Bush Hog s main manufacturing property in Selma, Alabama was contaminated with chlorinated volatile organic compounds which most likely resulted from painting and cleaning operations during the 1960s and 70s.
897077_11_ITEM15_P186_S1	The contaminated areas were primarily in the location of underground storage tanks and underneath the former waste storage area.
897077_11_ITEM15_P186_S2	Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, Bush Hog s prior owner agreed to and has removed the underground storage tanks at its cost and has remedied the identified contamination in accordance with the regulations of the Alabama Department of Environmental Management.
897077_11_ITEM15_P186_S3	An environmental consulting firm was retained by the prior owner and is administering the cleanup and will monitor the sites on an ongoing basis until the remediation program is complete and approved by the applicable authorities.
897077_11_ITEM15_P187_S0	Certain other assets of the Company contain asbestos that may have to be remediated over time.
897077_11_ITEM15_P187_S1	Management has made its best estimate of the cost to remediate these environmental issues.
897077_11_ITEM15_P187_S2	However, such estimates are difficult to estimate including the timing of such costs.
897077_11_ITEM15_P187_S3	The Company believes that any subsequent change in the liability associated with the asbestos removal will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations.
897077_11_ITEM15_P188_S0	The Company is subject to various other federal, state, and local laws affecting its business, as well as a variety of regulations relating to such matters as working conditions, equal employment opportunities and product safety.
897077_11_ITEM15_P188_S1	A variety of state laws regulate the Company s contractual relationships with its dealers, some of which impose restrictive standards on the relationship between the Company and its dealers, including events of default, grounds for termination, non-renewal of dealer contracts and equipment repurchase requirements.
897077_11_ITEM15_P188_S2	The Company believes it is currently in material compliance with all such applicable laws and regulations.
897077_11_ITEM15_P189_S0	Summarized quarterly financial data for 2010 and 2009 is presented below.
897077_11_ITEM15_P190_S0	Seasonal influences affect the Company s sales and profits, with peak business occurring in May through August.
897077_11_ITEM15_P191_S0	The sum of quarterly earnings per share may not equal total year earnings per share due to rounding of earnings per share amounts, and differences in weighted-average shares and equivalent shares outstanding for each of the periods presented.
897077_11_ITEM15_P192_S0	The third quarter of 2010 results include a tax credit of $0.9 million relating to prior years research and development expenses.
897077_11_ITEM15_P192_S1	The fourth quarter 2009 results include the following items: (1) a pre-tax charge of $14.1 million related to goodwill impairment, (2) a pre-tax benefit of $3.7 million related to LIFO liquidation, and (3) a $ 30.2 million gain on bargain purchase of Bush Hog .
897077_11_ITEM15_P193_S0	On October 22, 2009 ( Closing Date ), the Company acquired the majority of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Bush Hog located in Selma, Alabama.
897077_11_ITEM15_P193_S1	The purchase included substantially all of the ongoing business of Bush Hog, including the Bush Hog brand name and all related product names and trademarks (the Acquisition ).
897077_11_ITEM15_P193_S2	The purchase price consideration was 1.7 million unregistered shares of Alamo Group common stock which represented approximately 14.5% of the outstanding stock of Alamo Group.
897077_11_ITEM15_P193_S3	Because the restricted stock was issued in an unregistered private transaction, resale of the shares is restricted and the shares may be resold only if registered or sold in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, including pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act.
897077_11_ITEM15_P193_S4	Under Rule 144, the restricted stock is subject to, among other things, an initial 6-month holding period before any of the shares can be sold in the public market.
897077_11_ITEM15_P193_S5	Accordingly, the fair value of the 1.7 million shares was based on the public market price of Alamo common stock less a discount for lack of marketability associated with the 6-month holding period.
897077_11_ITEM15_P193_S6	We utilized an Asian put option model to measure the discount for lack of marketability.
897077_11_ITEM15_P194_S0	An Asian put option is an option that entitles the holder to a payoff based on the average price of an underlying asset, over a predetermined period.
897077_11_ITEM15_P194_S1	The closing price of our common stock on October 22, 2009 was $16.09 per share.
897077_11_ITEM15_P195_S0	The Acquisition was accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations ( ASC Topic 805 ).
897077_11_ITEM15_P195_S1	Accordingly, the total purchase price was allocated on a provisional basis to assets acquired and net liabilities assumed in connection with the Acquisition based on their estimated fair values as of the completion of the Acquisition.
897077_11_ITEM15_P195_S2	These allocations reflected various provisional estimates that were available at the time and were subject to change during the purchase price allocation period as valuations are finalized.
897077_11_ITEM15_P196_S0	The Company believes that it was able to acquire Bush Hog for less than the fair value of its assets because of (i) the Company s unique position as a market leader in this industry segment and (ii) the seller s intent to exit its Bush Hog operations.
897077_11_ITEM15_P196_S1	Bush Hog was an unprofitable venture, and the seller approached the Company in an effort to sell Bush Hog and exit the agricultural equipment manufacturing business that no longer fit its strategy.
897077_11_ITEM15_P197_S0	With the seller's intent to exit the agricultural manufacturing business segment and the Company s position as a market leader, the Company was able to agree on a favorable purchase price.
897077_11_ITEM15_P198_S0	The primary reason for the Bush Hog acquisition was to help the Company further the goal of becoming the largest manufacturer of agricultural mowers in the world.
897077_11_ITEM15_P198_S1	This acquisition enabled the Company to expand its market presence, expand its product offerings and enter new markets.
897077_11_ITEM15_P199_S0	The fair value of the net assets acquired was approximately $53.1 million, which exceeds the preliminary estimated purchase price of $25.4 million.
897077_11_ITEM15_P199_S1	Accordingly, the Company recognized the excess of the fair value of the net assets over the purchase price of approximately $27.7 million as a gain on bargain purchase.
897077_11_ITEM15_P199_S2	The gain on bargain purchase of $27.7 million was shown separately within income from operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009.
897077_11_ITEM15_P199_S3	The recorded amount was provisional and subject to change.
897077_11_ITEM15_P199_S4	The Company evaluated the purchase price allocation during 2010, including the opening fair value of inventory, accounts receivable, property, plant equipment, accrued liabilities and deferred taxes, which required the Company to adjust the recorded gain.
897077_11_ITEM15_P200_S0	The following table summarizes the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the Closing Date.
897077_11_ITEM15_P200_S1	Since the acquisition, net adjustments of $2,488,000 were made to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with a corresponding adjustment to the bargain purchase gain.
897077_11_ITEM15_P201_S0	A single estimate of fair value results from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and relies heavily on estimates and assumptions.
897077_11_ITEM15_P201_S1	The Company s judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact the Company s results of operations.
897077_11_ITEM15_P201_S2	The December 31, 2009 financial statement balances and disclosures impacted by these adjustments have been retrospectively adjusted.
897077_11_ITEM15_P201_S3	The adjustments were due to the final valuation of property, plant and equipment, accounts receivable, other liabilities and deferred taxes.
897077_11_ITEM15_P202_S0	In accordance with the closing documents, the Company received a 50% undivided interest in the Accounts Receivable of Bush Hog , subject to any net working capital adjustment.
897077_11_ITEM15_P202_S1	The post closing net working capital adjustment was $3.8 million which increased accounts receivable and the gain on bargain purchase.
897077_11_ITEM15_P202_S2	The Company will collect payments on the acquired accounts receivable and remit 50% of the collections to the seller less the $3.8 million.
897077_11_ITEM15_P202_S3	The Bush Hog accounts receivable were recorded at 50% of the fair value, plus the working capital adjustment.
897077_11_ITEM15_P203_S0	The intangible asset relates to the appraised value of the Bush Hog name at closing and has an indefinite life.
897077_11_ITEM15_P204_S0	Under 805-10, acquisition related costs (i.e., advisory, legal, valuation and other professional fees) are not included as a component of consideration transferred, but are accounted for as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred.
897077_11_ITEM15_P204_S1	The Company incurred $828,000 of acquisition related costs.
897077_11_ITEM15_P205_S0	In 2010 Bush Hog s net revenue was $88.9 million and net profit was $4.3 million.
897077_11_ITEM15_P205_S1	In the period between the Closing Date and December 31, 2009, Bush Hog generated approximately $10.9 million of net revenue and $1.5 million net loss.
897077_11_ITEM15_P205_S2	The Company has included the operating results of Bush Hog in its consolidated financial statements since the Closing Date.
897077_11_ITEM15_P206_S0	The following table presents unaudited supplemental pro forma information as if the acquisition of Bush Hog had occurred on January 1, 2009 for the year ended December 31, 2010 and for the year ended December 31, 2009:
897077_11_ITEM15_P207_S0	The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the consolidated results of operations of the Company that would have been reported had the acquisition been completed as of the beginning of the periods presented, and should not be taken as being representative of the future consolidated results of operations of the Company.
897077_11_ITEM15_P208_S0	The company knows that Bush Hog s main manufacturing property in Selma, Alabama was contaminated with chlorinated volatile organic compounds which most likely resulted from painting and cleaning operations during the 1960 s and 70s.
897077_11_ITEM15_P208_S1	The contaminated areas were primarily in the location of underground storage tanks and underneath the former waste storage area.
897077_11_ITEM15_P208_S2	Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, Bush Hog s prior owner agreed to and has removed the underground storage tanks at its cost and has remedied the identified contamination in accordance with the regulations of the Alabama Department of Environmental Management.
897077_11_ITEM15_P208_S3	An environmental consulting firm was retained by the prior owner and is administering the cleanup and will monitor the sites on an ongoing basis until the remediation program is complete and approved by the applicable authorities.
897077_11_ITEM15_P209_S0	Rivard Developpement On May 30, 2008, the Company purchased Rivard Developpement S.A.S. ( Rivard ) , a leading French manufacturer of vacuum trucks, high-pressure cleaning systems and trenchers.
897077_11_ITEM15_P209_S1	The purchase price was approximately 15 million (approximately U.S. $23 million) plus the assumption of certain liabilities.
897077_11_ITEM15_P209_S2	The Company has allocated the purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities assumed and recorded goodwill of approximately 9 million (approximately U.S. $15 million) related to this acquisition.
897077_11_ITEM15_P209_S3	We finalized the purchase price allocation during the second quarter of 2009.
897077_11_ITEM15_P209_S4	The majority of the purchase price was funded utilizing the Company s cash reserves in Europe, with the balance from bank credit facilities.
897077_11_ITEM15_P209_S5	Rivard s sales in 2007 were 40 million (approximately U.S. $62 million), and the company has 275 full-time employees.
897077_11_ITEM15_P210_S0	Rivard is located in Daumeray, France and was founded in 1952.
897077_11_ITEM15_P211_S0	The Board of Directors of the Company adopted the Alamo Group Inc. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the Plan ), effective as of January 3, 2011.
897077_11_ITEM15_P211_S1	The Plan will benefit certain key management or other highly compensated employees of the Company and/or certain subsidiaries who are selected by the Board to participate.
897077_11_ITEM15_P211_S2	The Plan is also intended to provide a benefit from the Company upon retirement, death or disability or a change in control of the Company.
897077_11_ITEM15_P211_S3	Accordingly, the Plan obligates the Company to pay to a participant a Retirement Benefit (as defined in the Plan) upon the occurrence of certain payment events to the extent a participant has a vested right thereto.

897077_11_ITEM15_P237_S0	The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	You should carefully consider each of the risks described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision with respect to the Company s securities.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the following risks develop into actual events, the Company s business, financial condition or results from operations could be materially and adversely affected and you could lose all or part of your investment.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Deterioration of industry conditions could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our business depends to a large extent upon the prospects for the mowing, right-of-way maintenance and agricultural markets in general.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Future prospects of the industry depend largely on factors outside of our control.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Any of those factors could adversely impact demand for our products, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	increase in unfunded pension plan liability due to financial market deterioration.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In addition, our business is susceptible to a number of factors that specifically affect agricultural customer spending patterns, including the following:
897077_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	A downturn in general economic conditions and outlook in the United States and around the world could adversely affect our net sales and earnings.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The strength and profitability of our business depends on the overall demand for our products and upon economic conditions and outlook, including but not limited to economic growth rates; consumer spending levels; financing availability, pricing and terms for our dealers and end-users; employment rates; interest rates; inflation; consumer confidence and general economic and political conditions and expectations in the United States and the foreign economies in which we conduct business.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Slow or negative growth rates, inflationary pressures, higher commodity costs and energy prices, reduced credit availability or unfavorable credit terms for our dealers and end-user customers, increased unemployment rates, and continued recessionary economic conditions and outlook could cause consumers to continue to reduce spending, which may cause them to delay or forego purchases of our products and could have an adverse effect on our net sales and earnings.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We depend on governmental sales and a decrease in such sales could adversely affect us.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales to federal, state and local governmental entities both in the U.S. and in other countries in which we sell our products.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	These sales depend primarily on the levels of budgeted and appropriated expenditures for highway, airport, roadside and parks maintenance by various governmental entities and are affected by changes in local and national economic conditions.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our dependence on, and the price and availability of, raw materials as well as purchased components may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We are subject to fluctuations in market prices for raw materials such as steel and energy.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Additionally, although most of the raw materials and purchase components we use are commercially available from a number of sources, we could experience disruptions in the availability of such materials.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If we are unable to purchase materials we require or are unable to pass on price increases to our customers or otherwise reduce our cost of goods sold, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P10_S3	In addition, higher energy costs may negatively affect spending by farmers, including their purchases of our products.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	This analysis requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P12_S2	The cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of time, which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to an even higher degree of uncertainty.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P12_S3	The Company also utilizes market valuation models and other financial ratios, which require the Company to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to its assets and businesses.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P12_S4	The Company believes that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values of each of its reporting units are reasonable.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P12_S5	However, different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	As of December 31, 2010, goodwill was $34,073,000, which represents 9% of total assets.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	The Company recognized no goodwill impairment in 2010.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P13_S2	The North American Industrial segment had a goodwill impairment of $14,104,000 in 2009.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P13_S3	During the 2010 impairment analysis review, it was noted that even though the Schwarze reporting unit s fair value was above carrying value it was not materially different.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P13_S4	On December 31, 2010, there was approximately $6.8 million of goodwill related to the Schwarze reporting unit.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P13_S5	This reporting unit would be most likely affected by changes in the Company s assumptions and estimates.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P13_S6	The calculation of fair value could increase or decrease depending on changes in the inputs and assumptions used, such as changes in the reporting unit s future growth rates, discount rates, etc.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We operate in a highly competitive industry, and some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater resources than we do.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our products are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We compete with several large national and international companies that offer a broad range of equipment and replacement parts that compete with our products, as well as with numerous small, privately-held manufacturers and suppliers of a limited number of products mainly on a regional basis.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Some of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater financial and other resources at their disposal.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P15_S3	We believe that we are able to compete successfully in our markets by, to some extent, avoiding direct competition with significantly larger potential competitors.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P15_S4	There can be no assurance that our competitors will not substantially increase the resources devoted to the development and marketing of products competitive with our products or that new competitors with greater resources will not enter our markets.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Any failure to effectively compete could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We operate and source internationally, which exposes us to the political, economic and other risks of doing business abroad.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We have operations in a number of countries outside of the United States.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Our international operations are subject to the risks normally associated with conducting business in foreign countries, including but not limited to the following:
897077_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the United States and the other countries in which we operate affecting foreign trade, investment and taxation.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	In addition, political developments and governmental regulations and policies in the countries in which we operate directly affect the demand for our products.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	For example, decreases or delays in farm subsidies to our agricultural customers, or changes in environmental policies aimed at limiting mowing activities, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our acquisition strategy may not be successful, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We intend to grow internally and through the acquisition of businesses and assets that will complement our current businesses.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P21_S1	To date, a material portion of our growth has come through acquisitions.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition targets, obtain financing for acquisitions on satisfactory terms or successfully acquire identified targets.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Competition for acquisition opportunities may also increase our costs of making acquisitions or prevent us from making certain acquisitions.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P21_S4	These and other acquisition-related factors may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We may be unable to complete or integrate existing or future acquisitions effectively, and businesses we have acquired, or may acquire in the future, may not perform as expected.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We may not be successful in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations and achieving projected synergies.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	We could face many risks in integrating acquired businesses, but not limited to the following:
897077_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	we may encounter unanticipated events, circumstances or legal liabilities.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts from the management of each entity, including coordinating existing business plans and research and development efforts.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Integrating operations may distract management s attention from the day-to-day operation of the combined companies.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Ultimately, our attempts to integrate the operations, technology and personnel of acquired businesses may not be successful.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P25_S3	If we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses, our future results may be negatively impacted.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	In addition, we may be adversely affected if businesses that we have acquired, or that we acquire in the future, do not perform as expected.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	An acquired business could perform below our expectations for a number of reasons, including legislative or regulatory changes that affect the areas in which the acquired business specializes, the loss of customers and dealers, general economic factors that directly affect the acquired business, and the cultural incompatibility of its management team.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Any or all of these reasons could adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The agricultural industry and the mowing and right of way maintenance industry are seasonal and are affected by the weather, and seasonal fluctuations may cause our results of operations and working capital to fluctuate from quarter to quarter.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	In general, agricultural and governmental end-users typically purchase new equipment during the first and second calendar quarters.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Other products such as street sweepers, excavators, snow blowers, front-end loaders and pothole patchers have different seasonal patterns, as do replacement parts in general.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P28_S2	In attempting to achieve efficient utilization of manpower and facilities throughout the year, we estimate seasonal demand months in advance and manufacturing capacity is scheduled in anticipation of such demand.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P28_S3	We utilize a rolling twelve-month sales forecast provided by our marketing divisions and order backlog in order to develop a production plan for our manufacturing facilities.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Additionally, many of our marketing departments attempt to equalize demand for their products throughout the calendar year by offering seasonal sales programs which may provide additional incentives, including discounts and extended payment terms, on equipment that is ordered during off-season periods.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Because we spread our production and wholesale shipments throughout the year to take into account the factors described above, sales in any given period may not reflect the timing of dealer orders and retail demand.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Weather conditions and general economic conditions may affect the timing of purchases and actual industry conditions might differ from our forecasts.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Consequently, we cannot assure that sudden or significant declines in industry demand would not adversely affect our working capital or results of operations.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	If we do not retain key personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees, our business may suffer.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our continued success will depend on, among other things, the efforts and skills of our executive officers, including our president and chief executive officer, and our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified managerial, technical, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P31_S1	We do not maintain key man life insurance for any of our employees, and all of our senior management are employed at will.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P31_S2	We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and hire suitable replacements for any of our key employees.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P31_S3	We believe the loss of a key executive officer or other key employee could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We are subject on an ongoing basis to the risk of product liability claims and other litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Like other manufacturers, we are subject to various claims, including product liability claims, arising in the ordinary course of business, and we are a party to various legal proceedings that constitute routine litigation incidental to our business.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We may be exposed to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury, property damage, or both.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P33_S2	We cannot assure you that we will not experience any material product liability losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P33_S3	While we currently have product liability insurance, we cannot assure you that our product liability insurance coverage will be adequate for any liabilities that may ultimately be incurred or that it will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P33_S4	A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage or a requirement to participate in a product recall may have a materially adverse effect on our business.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We are subject to environmental, health and safety and employment laws and regulations and related compliance expenditures and liabilities.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Like other manufacturers, the Company is subject to a broad range of federal, state, local and foreign laws and requirements, including those concerning air emissions, discharges into waterways, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials, as well as the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances at our facilities and offsite disposal locations, workplace safety and equal employment opportunities.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P35_S1	These laws and regulations are constantly changing, and it is impossible to predict with accuracy the effect that changes to such laws and regulations may have on us in the future.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Like other industrial concerns, our manufacturing operations entail the risk of noncompliance, and there can be no assurance that we will not incur material costs or other liabilities as a result thereof.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The Company knows that its Indianola, Iowa property is contaminated with chromium which most likely resulted from chrome plating operations which were discontinued before the Company purchased the property.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Chlorinated volatile organic compounds have also been detected in water samples on the property, though the source is unknown at this time.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P36_S2	The Company voluntarily worked with an environmental consultant and the state of Iowa with respect to these issues and believes it completed its remediation program in June 2006.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P36_S3	The work was accomplished within the Company s environmental liability reserve balance.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P36_S4	We requested a no further action classification from the state.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P36_S5	We received a conditional no further action letter in January of 2009.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P36_S6	When we demonstrate stable or improving conditions below residential standards by future monitoring of existing wells, an unconditional no further action letter will be requested.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	On December 31, 2010, the Company had an environmental reserve in the amount of $1,495,000 related to the acquisition of Gradall s facility in New Philadelphia, Ohio.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Three specific remediation projects that were identified prior to the acquisition are in process of remediation with a remaining reserve balance of $30,000.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P37_S2	The Company has a reserve of $277,000 concerning a potential asbestos issue that is expected to be remediated over time.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P37_S3	The balance of the reserve, $1,188,000, is mainly for potential ground water contamination/remediation that was identified before the acquisition and believed to have been generated by a third party company located near the Gradall facility.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The Company knows that Bush Hog s main manufacturing property in Selma, Alabama was contaminated with chlorinated volatile organic compounds which most likely resulted from painting and cleaning operations during the 1960 s and 70s.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P38_S1	The contaminated areas were primarily in the location of underground storage tanks and underneath the former waste storage area.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, Bush Hog s prior owner agreed to and has removed the underground storage tanks at its cost and has remedied the identified contamination in accordance with the regulations of the Alabama Department of Environmental Management.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P38_S3	An environmental consulting firm was retained by the prior owner and is administering the cleanup and will monitor the sites on an ongoing basis until the remediation program is complete and approved by the applicable authorities.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Certain other assets of the Company contain asbestos that may have to be remediated over time.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Management has made its best estimate of the cost to remediate these environmental issues.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P39_S2	However, such estimates are difficult to estimate including the timing of such costs.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P39_S3	The Company believes that any subsequent change in the liability associated with the asbestos removal will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We have incurred and will continue to incur capital and other expenditures to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our operations.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P40_S1	In particular, if we fail to comply with any environmental regulations, then we could be subject to future liabilities, fines or penalties or the suspension of production at our manufacturing facilities.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P40_S2	If unexpected obligations at these or other sites or more stringent environmental laws are imposed in the future, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	If we are unable to comply with the terms of our credit arrangements, especially the financial covenants, our credit arrangements could be terminated.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all of the terms of our credit arrangements, especially the financial covenants.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Our ability to comply with such terms depends on the success of our business and our operating results.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Various risks, uncertainties, and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with the terms of our credit arrangements.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P42_S3	If we were out of compliance with any covenant required by our credit arrangements following any applicable cure periods, the banks could terminate their commitments unless we could negotiate a covenant waiver.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P42_S4	The banks could condition such waiver on amendments to the terms of our credit arrangements that may be unfavorable to us including, the interest rate we currently pay on outstanding debt under our credit arrangements could increase, which could adversely affect our operating results.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominantly in European countries, Canada and Australia, as a result of the sale of our products in international markets.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P44_S1	While we do hedge against such fluctuations to an extent (primarily in the U.K. market), we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively manage these risks.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, such as a devaluation of the Euro against the U.S. dollar, could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations or financial condition.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Because the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and its trading volume has generally been low, it may be difficult for you to resell our common stock when desired or at attractive prices.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P46_S1	The closing prices of our common stock on the NYSE during 2010 ranged from $27.82 to $17.02 per share, and during 2009 from $17.15 to $9.37 per share.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Our stock price may fluctuate in response to the risk factors set forth herein and to a number of events and factors, such as quarterly variations in operating and financial results, litigation, changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts, the operating and stock performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us, news reports relating to us or trends in our industry or general economic conditions.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Furthermore, the trading volume of our common stock has generally been low, which may increase the volatility of the market price for our stock.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P46_S4	The stock price volatility and low trading volume may make it difficult for you to resell your shares of our common stock when desired or at attractive prices.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P47_S0	You may experience dilution of your ownership interests due to the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We may issue shares of our previously authorized and unissued securities which will result in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P48_S1	We are currently authorized to issue 20,000,000 shares of common stock.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P48_S2	On December 31, 2010, 11,829,879 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding, and there were outstanding options to purchase an additional 471,530 shares of our common stock.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P48_S3	We also have additional shares available for grant under our 2005 Incentive Stock Option Plan and our 2009 Equity Incentive Plan.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P48_S4	Additional stock option or other compensation plans or amendments to existing plans for employees and directors may be adopted.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P48_S5	Issuance of these shares of common stock may dilute the ownership interests of our then existing stockholders.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P48_S6	We may also issue additional shares of our common stock in connection with the hiring of personnel, future acquisitions, such as the 1,700,000 shares issued as consideration for the acquisition of Bush Hog , future private placements of our securities for capital raising purposes or for other business purposes.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P48_S7	This would further dilute the interests of our existing stockholders.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Future sales, or the possibility of future sales, of a substantial amount of our common stock may depress the price of the shares of our common stock.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Future sales, or the availability for sale in the public market, of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P50_S1	If we or our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or if there is a perception that these sales may occur, the market price of our common stock could decline.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P51_S0	There is no assurance that we will continue declaring dividends or have the available cash to make dividend payments.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Although we have paid a cash dividend of $0.06 per share in each quarter since the third quarter of 1999, there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or that funds will continue to be available for this purpose in the future.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P52_S1	The declaration and payment of dividends are restricted by the terms of our amended and restated revolving credit agreement and are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, are not cumulative, and will depend upon our profitability, financial condition, capital needs, future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Provisions of our corporate documents may have anti-takeover effects that could prevent a change in control.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Provisions of our charter, bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P54_S1	These provisions include supermajority voting requirements, prohibiting the stockholder from calling stockholder meetings, removal of directors for cause only and prohibiting shareholder actions by written consent.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws state that any amendment to certain provisions, including those provisions regarding the removal of directors and limitations on action by written consent discussed above, be approved by the holders of at least two-thirds of our common stock.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P54_S3	We are also afforded the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which would prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a person who becomes a 15% or greater shareholder for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such status unless certain board or shareholder approvals were obtained.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Certain stockholders own a significant amount of our common stock, and their interests may conflict with those of our other stockholders.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P56_S0	As of December 31, 2010, Capital Southwest Venture Corporation, a subsidiary of Capital Southwest Corporation, beneficially owned approximately 24% of our outstanding common stock and three other investors, Duroc, LLC, Dimensional Fund Advisors LP and Third Avenue Management LLC beneficially own approximately 29% of our outstanding common stock.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P56_S1	As a result, either Capital Southwest or the other major stockholders combined could be able to significantly influence the direction of the Company, the election of our Board of Directors and the outcome of any other matter requiring stockholder approval, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and together with other beneficially owned investors, to prevent or cause a change in control of the Company.
897077_11_ITEM1A_P56_S2	In addition, the interests of Capital Southwest and other major stockholders may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.

897077_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	The Company added to its presence in the industrial and governmental vegetation markets with the acquisition of Tiger Corporation ( Tiger ) in late 1994.
897077_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	The Company entered the agricultural mowing markets in 1986 with the acquisition of Rhino Products Inc. ( Rhino ) , a leading manufacturer in this field.
897077_12_ITEM1_P5_S1	With this acquisition, the Company embarked on a strategy to increase the Rhino dealer distribution network during a period of industry contraction.
897077_12_ITEM1_P5_S2	The addition of M W Gear Company ( M W ) in early 1995 allowed the Company to enter into the manufacturing and distribution of tillage equipment, which complements the Rhino distribution network.
897077_12_ITEM1_P5_S3	M W has been integrated into the agricultural marketing group.
897077_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	In 1991, the Company began its international expansion with the acquisition of McConnel Ltd .

897077_12_ITEM1_P57_S2	The percentage decrease in 2011 was mainly from a change in sales mix between wholegoods and parts.
897077_12_ITEM1_P57_S3	Proprietary replacement parts generally are more profitable and less cyclical than wholegoods.
897077_12_ITEM1_P58_S0	While the Company believes that the end-users of its products evaluate their purchases on the basis of price, reputation and product quality, such purchases are also based on a dealer s service, support of and loyalty to the dealer based on previous purchase experiences, as well as other factors such as product and replacement part availability.
897077_12_ITEM1_P58_S1	The Company s ability to provide innovative responses to customer needs, to develop and manufacture new products, and to enhance existing product lines is important to its success.
897077_12_ITEM1_P59_S0	The Company continually conducts research and development activities in an effort to improve existing products and develop new products.

897077_12_ITEM1_P59_S4	Seasonality The Company s sales, both product and replacement parts, are generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year, because a substantial number of the Company s products are used for maintenance activities such as vegetation maintenance, highway right-of-way maintenance, construction, and street and parking lot sweeping.
897077_12_ITEM1_P59_S5	Usage of this equipment is lower in harsh weather.
897077_12_ITEM1_P60_S0	The Company utilizes a rolling twelve-month sales forecast provided by the Company s marketing departments and order backlog in order to develop a production plan for its manufacturing facilities.
897077_12_ITEM1_P60_S1	In addition, many of the Company s marketing departments attempt to equalize demand for products throughout the calendar year by offering seasonal sales programs which may provide additional incentives, including discounts and extended payment terms, under these programs.
897077_12_ITEM1_P61_S0	Competition The Company s products are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world.
897077_12_ITEM1_P61_S1	The principal competitive factors are price, quality, availability, service and reputation.
897077_12_ITEM1_P61_S2	The Company competes with several large national and international companies that offer a broad range of equipment and replacement parts, as well as with numerous small, privately-held manufacturers and suppliers of a limited number of products, mainly on a regional basis.

897077_12_ITEM1_P61_S4	The Company believes that it is able to compete successfully in its markets by effectively managing its manufacturing costs, offering high quality products, developing and designing innovative products and, to some extent, avoiding direct competition with significantly larger potential competitors.
897077_12_ITEM1_P61_S5	There can be no assurance that the Company s competitors will not substantially increase the resources devoted to the development and marketing of products competitive with the Company s products or that new competitors with greater resources will not enter the Company s markets.
897077_12_ITEM1_P62_S0	As of December 31, 2011 , the Company had unfilled customer orders of $ 119,923,000 compared to $ 97,616,000 at December 31, 2010 .
897077_12_ITEM1_P62_S1	The 23% increase was primarily due to the positive impact of improved agricultural market conditions on Bush Hog and Rhino backlogs.
897077_12_ITEM1_P63_S0	The Company continues to be affected by soft market conditions and reduced government spending in parts of its Industrial and European divisions due to the downturn in the global economy.
897077_12_ITEM1_P63_S1	Management expects that substantially all of the Company s backlog as of December 31, 2011 will be shipped during fiscal year 2012 .
897077_12_ITEM1_P64_S0	The amount of unfilled orders at a particular time is affected by a number of factors, including manufacturing and shipping schedules which, in most instances, are dependent on the Company s seasonal sales programs and the requirements of its customers.
897077_12_ITEM1_P64_S1	Certain of the Company s orders are subject to cancellation at any time before shipment; therefore, a comparison of unfilled orders from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of future actual shipments.
897077_12_ITEM1_P65_S0	No single customer is responsible for 10% or more of the aggregate revenue of the Company.
897077_12_ITEM1_P66_S0	Sources of Supply The principal raw materials used by the Company include steel, other metal components and hydraulic tubing.

897077_12_ITEM1_P66_S2	No one supplier is responsible for supplying more than 10% of the principal raw materials used by the Company.
897077_12_ITEM1_P67_S0	While the Company manufactures many of the parts for its products, a significant percentage of parts, including most drivelines, gearboxes, industrial engines, and hydraulic components, are purchased from outside suppliers which manufacture to the Company s specifications.
897077_12_ITEM1_P67_S1	In addition, the Company, through its subsidiaries, purchases tractors and truck chassis as a number of the Company s products are mounted and shipped with a tractor or truck chassis.
897077_12_ITEM1_P67_S2	Tractors and truck chassis are generally available, but some delays in receiving tractors or truck chassis can occur throughout the year.

897077_12_ITEM1_P69_S1	While the Company considers its patents to be advantageous to its business, it is not dependent on any single patent or group of patents.
897077_12_ITEM1_P69_S2	The Company amortized approximately $79,000 in patents and trademarks relating to the industrial segment.
897077_12_ITEM1_P69_S3	In 2010, the Company wrote off $224,000 in older patents which the Company believes no longer provide a competitive advantage.

897077_12_ITEM1_P70_S3	Management believes that the Company s trademarks are well known in its markets and are valuable and that their value is increasing with the development of its business.
897077_12_ITEM1_P71_S0	The Company actively protects its trademarks against infringement and believes it has applied for or registered its trademarks in the appropriate jurisdictions.
897077_12_ITEM1_P72_S0	Environmental and Other Governmental Regulations Like other manufacturers, the Company is subject to a broad range of federal, state, local and foreign laws and requirements, including those concerning air emissions, discharges into waterways, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials, as well as the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances at the Company s facilities and offsite disposal locations, workplace safety and equal employment opportunities.
897077_12_ITEM1_P72_S1	These laws and regulations are constantly changing, and it is impossible to predict with accuracy the effect that changes to such laws and regulations may have on the Company in the future.
897077_12_ITEM1_P73_S0	Like other industrial concerns, the Company s manufacturing operations entail the risk of noncompliance, and there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur material costs or other liabilities as a result thereof.
897077_12_ITEM1_P74_S0	The Company knows that its Indianola, Iowa property is contaminated with chromium which most likely resulted from chrome plating operations which were discontinued before the Company purchased the property.
897077_12_ITEM1_P74_S1	Chlorinated volatile organic compounds have also been detected in water samples on the property, though the source is unknown at this time.
897077_12_ITEM1_P74_S2	The Company voluntarily worked with an environmental consultant and the state of Iowa with respect to these issues and believes it completed its remediation program in June 2006.

897077_12_ITEM1_P75_S1	The reserve of $ 1,185,000 , is for potential ground water contamination/remediation that was identified before the acquisition and believed to have been generated by a third party company located near the Gradall facility.
897077_12_ITEM1_P76_S0	The Company knows that Bush Hog s main manufacturing property in Selma, Alabama was contaminated with chlorinated volatile organic compounds which most likely resulted from painting and cleaning operations during the 1960s and 1970s.
897077_12_ITEM1_P76_S1	The contaminated areas were primarily in the location of underground storage tanks and underneath the former waste storage area.
897077_12_ITEM1_P76_S2	Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, Bush Hog s prior owner agreed to and has removed the underground storage tanks at its cost and has remediated the identified contamination in accordance with the regulations of the Alabama Department of Environmental Management.
897077_12_ITEM1_P76_S3	An environmental consulting firm was retained by the prior owner and administered the cleanup and will monitor the site on an ongoing basis until the remediation program is complete and approved by the applicable authorities.
897077_12_ITEM1_P77_S0	Certain other assets of the Company contain asbestos that may have to be remediated over time.
897077_12_ITEM1_P77_S1	The Company believes that any subsequent change in the liability associated with the asbestos removal will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

897077_12_ITEM1_P78_S2	The Company believes it is currently in material compliance with all such applicable laws and regulations.

897077_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	condition or results from operations could be materially and adversely affected and you could lose all or part of your investment.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Deterioration of industry conditions could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our business depends to a large extent upon the prospects for the mowing, right-of-way maintenance and agricultural markets in general.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Future prospects of the industry depend largely on factors outside of our control.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Any of those factors could adversely impact demand for our products, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	increase in unfunded pension plan liability due to financial market deterioration.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In addition, our business is susceptible to a number of factors that specifically affect agricultural customer spending patterns, including the following:
897077_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	A downturn in general economic conditions and outlook in the United States and around the world could adversely affect our net sales and earnings.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The strength and profitability of our business depends on the overall demand for our products and upon economic conditions and outlook, including but not limited to economic growth rates; consumer spending levels; financing availability, pricing and terms for our dealers and end-users; employment rates; interest rates; inflation; consumer confidence and general economic and political conditions and expectations in the United States and the other economies in which we conduct business.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Slow or negative growth rates, inflationary pressures, higher commodity costs and energy prices, reduced credit availability or unfavorable credit terms for our dealers and end-user customers, increased unemployment rates, and continued recessionary economic conditions and outlook could cause consumers to continue to reduce spending, which may cause them to delay or forego purchases of our products and could have an adverse effect on our net sales and earnings.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We depend on governmental sales and a decrease in such sales could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales to federal, state and local governmental entities both in the U.S. and in other countries in which we sell our products.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	These sales depend primarily on the levels of budgeted and appropriated expenditures for highway, airport, roadside and parks maintenance by various governmental entities and are affected by changes in local and national economic conditions.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our dependence on, and the price and availability of, raw materials as well as purchased components may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We are subject to fluctuations in market prices for raw materials such as steel and energy.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Additionally, although most of the raw materials and purchase components we use are commercially available from a number of sources, we could experience disruptions in the availability of such materials.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If we are unable to purchase materials we require or are unable to pass on price increases to our customers or otherwise reduce our cost of goods sold, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P10_S3	In addition, higher energy costs may negatively affect spending by farmers, including their purchases of our products.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	This analysis requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P11_S2	The cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of time, which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to an even higher degree of uncertainty.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P11_S3	The Company also utilizes market valuation models and other financial ratios, which require the Company to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to its assets and businesses.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	As of December 31, 2011 , goodwill was $ 31,751,000 , which represents 8% of total assets.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The Company recognized goodwill impairment at two of its French operations, SMA and Rousseau , in the Company's European division of $1,898,000 in 2011 and no goodwill impairment in 2010.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P12_S2	During the 2011 impairment analysis review, it was noted that even though the Schwarze, Rivard and Faucheux reporting units' fair value was above carrying value it was not materially different.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P12_S3	On December 31, 2011 , there was approximately $6.8 million, $11.6 million and $0.6 million of goodwill related to the Schwarze, Rivard and Faucheux reporting units respectively.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P12_S4	These reporting units would be most likely affected by changes in the Company s assumptions and estimates.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P12_S5	The calculation of fair value could increase or decrease depending on changes in the inputs and assumptions used, such as changes in the reporting unit s future growth rates, discount rates, etc.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We operate in a highly competitive industry, and some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater resources than we do.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Our products are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We compete with several large national and international companies that offer a broad range of equipment and replacement parts that compete with our products, as well as with numerous small, privately-held manufacturers and suppliers of a limited number of products mainly on a regional basis.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Some of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater financial and other resources at their disposal.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P13_S4	We believe that we are able to compete successfully in our markets by, to some extent, avoiding direct competition with significantly larger potential competitors.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P13_S5	There can be no assurance that our competitors will not substantially increase the resources devoted to the development and marketing of products competitive with our products or that new competitors with greater resources will not enter our markets.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P13_S6	Any failure to effectively compete could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P13_S7	We operate and source internationally, which exposes us to the political, economic and other risks of doing business abroad.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We have operations in a number of countries outside of the United States.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Our international operations are subject to the risks normally associated with conducting business in foreign countries, including but not limited to the following:
897077_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the United States and the other countries in which we operate affecting foreign trade, investment and taxation.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	In addition, political developments and governmental regulations and policies in the countries in which we operate directly affect the demand for our products.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P16_S1	For example, decreases or delays in farm subsidies to our agricultural customers, or changes in environmental policies aimed at limiting mowing activities, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Our acquisition strategy may not be successful, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P16_S3	We intend to grow internally and through the acquisition of businesses and assets that will complement our current businesses.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P16_S4	To date, a material portion of our growth has come through acquisitions.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P16_S5	We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition targets, obtain financing for acquisitions on satisfactory terms or successfully acquire identified targets.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P16_S6	Competition for acquisition opportunities may also increase our costs of making acquisitions or prevent us from making certain acquisitions.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P16_S7	These and other acquisition-related factors may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P16_S8	We may be unable to complete or integrate existing or future acquisitions effectively, and businesses we have acquired, or may acquire in the future, may not perform as expected.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P16_S9	We may not be successful in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations and achieving projected synergies.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P16_S10	We could face many risks in integrating acquired businesses, including but not limited to the following:
897077_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	we may encounter unanticipated events, circumstances or legal liabilities.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts from the management of each entity, including coordinating existing business plans and research and development efforts.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Integrating operations may distract management s attention from the day-to-day operation of the combined companies.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Ultimately, our attempts to integrate the operations, technology and personnel of acquired businesses may not be successful.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P18_S3	If we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses, our future results may be negatively impacted.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P18_S4	In addition, we may be adversely affected if businesses that we have acquired, or that we acquire in the future, do not perform as expected.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P18_S5	An acquired business could perform below our expectations for a number of reasons, including legislative or regulatory changes that affect the areas in which the acquired business specializes, the loss of customers and dealers, general economic factors that directly affect the acquired business, and the cultural incompatibility of its management team.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Any or all of these reasons could adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P18_S7	The agricultural industry and the mowing and right of way maintenance industry are seasonal and are affected by the weather, and seasonal fluctuations may cause our results of operations and working capital to fluctuate from quarter to quarter.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P18_S8	In general, agricultural and governmental end-users typically purchase new equipment during the first and second calendar quarters.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P18_S9	Other products such as street sweepers, excavators, snow blowers, front-end loaders and pothole patchers have different seasonal patterns, as do replacement parts in general.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	advance and manufacturing capacity is scheduled in anticipation of such demand.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We utilize a rolling twelve-month sales forecast provided by our marketing divisions and order backlog in order to develop a production plan for our manufacturing facilities.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Additionally, many of our marketing departments attempt to equalize demand for their products throughout the calendar year by offering seasonal sales programs which may provide additional incentives, including discounts and extended payment terms, on equipment that is ordered during off-season periods.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Because we spread our production and wholesale shipments throughout the year to take into account the factors described above, sales in any given period may not reflect the timing of dealer orders and retail demand.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Weather conditions and general economic conditions may affect the timing of purchases and actual industry conditions might differ from our forecasts.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Consequently, sudden or significant declines in industry demand could adversely affect our working capital or results of operations.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P19_S6	If we do not retain key personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees, our business may suffer.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P19_S7	Our continued success will depend on, among other things, the efforts and skills of our executive officers, including our president and chief executive officer, and our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified managerial, technical, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P19_S8	We do not maintain key man life insurance for any of our employees, and all of our senior management are employed at will.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P19_S9	We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and hire suitable replacements for any of our key employees.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P19_S10	We believe the loss of a key executive officer or other key employee could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P19_S11	We are subject on an ongoing basis to the risk of product liability claims and other litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P19_S12	Like other manufacturers, we are subject to various claims, including product liability claims, arising in the ordinary course of business, and we are a party to various legal proceedings that constitute routine litigation incidental to our business.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P19_S13	We may be exposed to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury, property damage, or both.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P19_S14	We cannot assure you that we will not experience any material product liability losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P19_S15	While we currently have product liability insurance, we cannot assure you that our product liability insurance coverage will be adequate for any liabilities that may ultimately be incurred or that it will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P19_S16	A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage or a requirement to participate in a product recall may have a materially adverse effect on our business.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P19_S17	We are subject to environmental, health and safety and employment laws and regulations and related compliance expenditures and liabilities.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P19_S18	Like other manufacturers, the Company is subject to a broad range of federal, state, local and foreign laws and requirements, including those concerning air emissions, discharges into waterways, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials, as well as the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances at the Company s facilities and offsite disposal locations, workplace safety and equal employment opportunities.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P19_S19	These laws and regulations are constantly changing, and it is impossible to predict with accuracy the effect that changes to such laws and regulations may have on the Company in the future.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Like other industrial concerns, the Company s manufacturing operations entail the risk of noncompliance, and there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur material costs or other liabilities as a result thereof.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The Company knows that its Indianola, Iowa property is contaminated with chromium which most likely resulted from chrome plating operations which were discontinued before the Company purchased the property.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Chlorinated volatile organic compounds have also been detected in water samples on the property, though the source is unknown at this time.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P21_S2	The Company voluntarily worked with an environmental consultant and the state of Iowa with respect to these issues and believes it completed its remediation program in June 2006.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P21_S3	The work was accomplished within the Company s environmental liability reserve balance.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P21_S4	We requested a no further action classification from the state.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P21_S5	We received a conditional no further action letter in January of 2009.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P21_S6	When we demonstrate stable or improving conditions below residential standards for a certain period of time by monitoring existing wells, an unconditional no further action letter will be requested.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	acquisition of Gradall s facility in New Philadelphia, Ohio.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The reserve of $ 1,185,000 , is for potential ground water contamination/remediation that was identified before the acquisition and believed to have been generated by a third party company located near the Gradall facility.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The Company knows that Bush Hog s main manufacturing property in Selma, Alabama was contaminated with chlorinated volatile organic compounds which most likely resulted from painting and cleaning operations during the 1960s and 1970s.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The contaminated areas were primarily in the location of underground storage tanks and underneath the former waste storage area.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, Bush Hog s prior owner agreed to and has removed the underground storage tanks at its cost and has remediated the identified contamination in accordance with the regulations of the Alabama Department of Environmental Management.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P23_S3	An environmental consulting firm was retained by the prior owner and administered the cleanup and will monitor the site on an ongoing basis until the remediation program is complete and approved by the applicable authorities.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Certain other assets of the Company contain asbestos that may have to be remediated over time.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The Company believes that any subsequent change in the liability associated with the asbestos removal will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The Company is subject to various other federal, state, and local laws affecting its business, as well as a variety of regulations relating to such matters as working conditions, equal employment opportunities, and product safety.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P25_S1	A variety of state laws regulate the Company s contractual relationships with its dealers, some of which impose restrictive standards on the relationship between the Company and its dealers, including events of default, grounds for termination, non-renewal of dealer contracts, and equipment repurchase requirements.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P25_S2	The Company believes it is currently in material compliance with all such applicable laws and regulations.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	If we are unable to comply with the terms of our credit arrangements, especially the financial covenants, our credit arrangements could be terminated.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all of the terms of our credit arrangements, especially the financial covenants.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Our ability to comply with such terms depends on the success of our business and our operating results.
897077_12_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Various risks, uncertainties, and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with the terms of our credit arrangements.

897077_12_ITEM7_P23_S2	The 2010 interest expense includes $375,000 in amortization of bank fees from the amendment to the Company's revolving credit agreement in November 2009.
897077_12_ITEM7_P23_S3	In 2009, the Company amortized $63,000 in bank fees relating to the same amendment.
897077_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	Other income net, was $290,000 during 2010 compared to income of $625,000 in 2009.
897077_12_ITEM7_P24_S1	The gains in both 2010 and 2009 are entirely from changes in exchange rates.
897077_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	Provision for Income Taxes was $7,915,000 (27.3% of income before income taxes) for 2010 compared to $12,473,000 (40.1% of income before income taxes) in 2009.
897077_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	Included in the 2010 tax provision is an $898,000 tax credit related to prior years' research and development expenses.
897077_12_ITEM7_P25_S2	The increase in the effective tax rate for 2009 was from increased state taxes in the United States and from the non-deductible tax write-off of goodwill in the Industrial Division.
897077_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	Net Income for 2010 was $21,117,000 compared to $18,633,000 in 2009 due to the factors described above.
897077_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	In addition to normal operating expenses, the Company has ongoing cash requirements which are necessary to conduct the Company s business, including inventory purchases and capital expenditures.
897077_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	The Company s inventory and accounts payable levels, particularly in its North American Agricultural Division, build in the first quarter and early spring and, to a lesser extent, in the fourth quarter in anticipation of the spring and fall selling seasons.
897077_12_ITEM7_P27_S2	Accounts receivable historically build in the first and fourth quarters of each year as a result of pre-season sales.
897077_12_ITEM7_P27_S3	These sales help balance the Company s production during the first and fourth quarters.
897077_12_ITEM7_P27_S4	Some of the Company s recent acquisitions which are not involved in vegetation maintenance have helped to soften this seasonality pattern.
897077_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	As of December 31, 2011 , the Company had working capital of $ 200,430,000 , which represents an increase of $ 14,559,000 from working capital of $ 185,871,000 as of December 31, 2010 .
897077_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	The increase in working capital was primarily from higher accounts receivable and inventory in the Company s North American operations and to a lessor extent from the acquisition of Tenco .
897077_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	Capital expenditures were $ 6,369,000 for 2011 , compared to $ 4,980,000 for 2010 .
897077_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	For 2012 , capital expenditures are expected to be higher compared to 2011 levels.
897077_12_ITEM7_P29_S2	The Company expects to fund capital expenditures from operating cash flows or through its revolving credit facility, described below.
897077_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	The Company was authorized by its Board of Directors in 1997 to repurchase up to 1,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock to be funded through working capital and credit facility borrowings.
897077_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	There were no shares repurchased in 2010 or in 2011 .
897077_12_ITEM7_P30_S2	The authorization to repurchase up to 1,000,000 shares remains available less 42,600 shares previously purchased.
897077_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company announced its plans to close the SMC manufacturing facility located in Sioux Falls, South Dakota and consolidate the operations into the Company's Gibson City, Illinois facility.
897077_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	The closure resulted in a pre-tax charge of $867,000 in redundancy costs.
897077_12_ITEM7_P31_S2	The Company is reviewing its options for the sale of the SMC plant and anticipates a gain on the sale of the facility when it occurs.
897077_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	Net cash provided by operating activities was $ 10,915,000 for 2011 , compared to $ 41,877,000 for 2010 .
897077_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	The decrease of cash from operating activities resulted primarily from increased inventory levels specifically in the Company s North American operations due to higher working capital requirements.
897077_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	Net cash used by financing activities was $ 19,071,000 for 2011 , compared to net cash used of $ 26,013,000 for 2010 .
897077_12_ITEM7_P33_S1	The decrease in financing activities in 2011 was from repayments of amounts borrowed from our bank credit facility due to cash provided by operating activities.
897077_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	On November 6, 2009, the Company entered into the Seventh Amendment of the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., BBVA Compass Bank, and Rabobank, as its lenders.
897077_12_ITEM7_P34_S1	The revolving credit line remained at $125.0 million.
897077_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	The purpose of the amendment was to add Bush Hog as a member of the Obligated Group and pledge a first priority security interest in certain U.S. assets (accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, trademarks and trade names) of the Borrower and each member of the Obligated Group.
897077_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	On March 28, 2011, the Company entered into the Eighth Amendment of Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement (the Eighth Credit Agreement Amendment ), by and among the Company, the lenders party thereto and Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent.
897077_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	The Eighth Credit Agreement Amendment amends certain provisions of the Company s existing credit facility to, among other things, (i) release the previously pledged security interest in certain assets of the Company and its specified subsidiaries which secured any indebtedness under the existing credit facility, (ii) extend the termination date of the Company s credit facility to March 28, 2016, (iii) reduce the aggregate commitments to $100,000,000, (iv) provide the Company the option to request an increase in aggregate commitments under the existing credit facility of up to $50,000,000, subject to the conditions set forth therein (v) lower the applicable leverage ratio, subject to certain exceptions and conditions, (vi) modify the limitation on capital expenditure, (vii) modify the limitation on other indebtedness and (viii) decrease the applicable interest margin for specified advances.
897077_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	As of December 31, 2011 , there was $ 7,000,000 borrowed under the revolving credit facility.
897077_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	On December 31, 2011 , $ 1,095,000 of the revolver capacity was committed to irrevocable standby letters of credit issued in the ordinary course of business as required by vendors contracts resulting in approximately $ 92,000,000 in available borrowings.
897077_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	On May 13, 2008, Alamo Group Europe Limited expanded its overdraft facility with Lloyd s TSB Bank plc from 1.0 million to 5.5 million .
897077_12_ITEM7_P38_S1	The facility was renewed effective October 29, 2011 and any outstanding balance would bear interest at Lloyd s Base Rate plus 1.4% per annum.
897077_12_ITEM7_P38_S2	The facility is unsecured but guaranteed by the U.K. subsidiaries of Alamo Group Europe Limited.
897077_12_ITEM7_P38_S3	As of December 31, 2011 , there were no outstanding balances in British pounds borrowed against the U.K. overdraft facility.
897077_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	There are additional lines of credit: for the Company s French operations in the amount of 6,200,000 Euros, which includes the Rivard credit facilities; for our Canadian operation in the amount of 3,500,000 Canadian dollars; and for our Australian operation in the amount of 800,000 Australian dollars.
897077_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	As of December 31, 2011 , 181,000 Euros were borrowed against the French line of credit; no Canadian dollars were outstanding on the Canadian line of credit; and 350,000 Australian dollars were outstanding under its facility.
897077_12_ITEM7_P39_S2	The Canadian and Australian revolving credit facilities are guaranteed by the Company.
897077_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	As of December 31, 2011 , the Company is in compliance with the terms and conditions of its credit facilities.
897077_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	Management believes the bank credit facilities and the Company s ability to internally generate funds from operations should be sufficient to meet the Company s cash requirements for the foreseeable future.
897077_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	However, the challenges affecting the banking industry and credit markets in general can potentially cause changes to credit availability which creates a level of uncertainty.
897077_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	The Company believes that inflation generally has not had a material impact on its operations or liquidity.
897077_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	The Company is exposed to the risk that the price of energy, steel and other purchased components may increase and the Company may not be able to increase the price of its products correspondingly.
897077_12_ITEM7_P42_S2	If this occurs, the Company s results of operations would be adversely impacted.
897077_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new accounting standard update, which amends the fair value measurement guidance and includes some enhanced disclosure requirements.
897077_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	The most significant change in disclosures is an expansion of the information required for Level 3 measurements based on unobservable inputs.
897077_12_ITEM7_P43_S2	The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.
897077_12_ITEM7_P43_S3	We will adopt this standard in the first quarter of 2012 and we do not expect the adoption will have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures.
897077_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued a new accounting standard, which eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of stockholders' equity.
897077_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	Instead, an entity will be required to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive, statements.
897077_12_ITEM7_P44_S2	The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.
897077_12_ITEM7_P44_S3	We will adopt this standard in the first quarter of 2012.
897077_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued a revised accounting standard, which is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary.
897077_12_ITEM7_P45_S1	Specifically, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two-step test.
897077_12_ITEM7_P45_S2	If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required.
897077_12_ITEM7_P45_S3	Otherwise, no further testing is required.
897077_12_ITEM7_P45_S4	This standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.
897077_12_ITEM7_P45_S5	We have elected to adopt this guidance for the year ended December 31, 2011 and the guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
897077_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	The Company does not have any obligation, under any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the Company is a party, that has or is reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
897077_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	The following table shows the Company s approximate obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011 :
897077_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	Definitions: (A) Long-term debt obligation means a principal payment obligation under long-term borrowings.
897077_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	(B) Capital lease obligation means a principal payment obligation under a lease classified as a capital lease.
897077_12_ITEM7_P48_S2	(C) Interest obligation represents interest due on long-term debt and capital lease obligations.
897077_12_ITEM7_P48_S3	Interest on long-term debt assumes all floating rates of interest remain the same as those in effect at December 31, 2011 and include the effect of the Company s interest rate derivative arrangements on future cash payments for the remaining period of those derivatives.
897077_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	(D) Operating lease obligation means a payment obligation under a lease classified as an operating lease.
897077_12_ITEM7_P49_S1	(E) Purchase obligation means an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the registrant that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions.
897077_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	Critical Accounting Estimates Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ).
897077_12_ITEM7_P50_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
897077_12_ITEM7_P50_S2	Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
897077_12_ITEM7_P50_S3	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
897077_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the financial statements.
897077_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
897077_12_ITEM7_P51_S2	For further information on the critical accounting policies, see Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
897077_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	The Company evaluates the collectability of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors.
897077_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	In circumstances where it is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations, the Company records a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what it believes will be collected.
897077_12_ITEM7_P52_S2	For all other customers, it recognizes reserves for bad debt based on historical experience of bad debts as a percent of revenues for each business unit, adjusted for relative improvements or deteriorations in the aging and changes in current economic conditions.
897077_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	The Company evaluates all receivables that are over 60 days old and will reserve specifically on a 90-day basis.
897077_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	The Company has a secured interest on most of its wholegoods that each customer purchases.
897077_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	This allows the Company, in times of a difficult economy when the customer is unable to pay or has filed for bankruptcy (usually Chapter 11), to repossess the customer s inventory.
897077_12_ITEM7_P54_S2	This also allows Alamo Group to maintain only a reserve over its cost, which usually represents the margin on the original sales price.
897077_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $ 3,215,000 on December 31, 2011 , and $ 2,852,000 on December 31, 2010 .
897077_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	The increase was mainly from the Company s Industrial and European operations.
897077_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	On December 31, 2011 , the Company had $ 14,567,000 in reserves for sales discounts compared to $ 11,903,000 on December 31, 2010 on product shipped to our customers under various promotional programs.
897077_12_ITEM7_P56_S1	The increase was due primarily to increased sales volume of the Company s agricultural products during the pre-season, which runs during the third and fourth quarters of each year with orders shipped through the second quarter of 2012.
897077_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	The Company reviews the reserve quarterly based on analysis made on each program outstanding at the time.
897077_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	The Company bases its reserves on historical data relating to discounts taken by the customer under each program.
897077_12_ITEM7_P58_S1	Historically, between 85% and 95% of the Company s customers who qualify for each program actually take the discount that is available.
897077_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	The Company had a reserve of $ 7,630,000 on December 31, 2011 and $ 7,506,000 on December 31, 2010 to cover obsolete and slow moving inventory.
897077_12_ITEM7_P59_S1	The increase in the reserve was mainly from the Company s U.S. operations.
897077_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	The obsolete and slow moving inventory policy states that the reserve is to be calculated as follows: 1) no inventory usage over a three-year period is deemed obsolete and reserved at 100 percent; and 2) slow moving inventory with little usage requires a 100 percent reserve on items that have a quantity greater than a three-year supply.
897077_12_ITEM7_P60_S1	There are exceptions to the obsolete and slow moving classifications if approved by an officer of the Company, based on specific identification of an item or items that are deemed to be either included or excluded from this classification.
897077_12_ITEM7_P60_S2	In cases where there is no historical data, management makes a judgment based on a specific review of the inventory in question to determine what reserves, if any, are appropriate.
897077_12_ITEM7_P60_S3	New products or parts are generally excluded from the reserve policy until a three-year history has been established.
897077_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	The reserve is reviewed and, if necessary, adjustments are made on a quarterly basis.
897077_12_ITEM7_P61_S1	The Company relies on historical information when available to support its reserve.
897077_12_ITEM7_P61_S2	The Company does not adjust the reserve balance until the inventory is liquidated.
897077_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	The Company s warranty policy is generally to provide its customers warranty for up to one year on all wholegood units and 90 days on parts though some components can have warranty for longer terms.
897077_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	Warranty reserve, as a percentage of sales, is generally calculated by looking at the current twelve months expenses and prorating that amount based on twelve months sales with a ninety-day to six-month lag period.
897077_12_ITEM7_P63_S1	The Company s historical experience is that an end-user takes approximately 90 days to six months from the receipt of the unit to file a warranty claim.
897077_12_ITEM7_P63_S2	A warranty reserve is established for each different marketing group.
897077_12_ITEM7_P63_S3	Reserve balances are evaluated on a quarterly basis and adjustments made when required.
897077_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	The current liability warranty reserve balance was $ 5,313,000 on December 31, 2011 and $ 5,554,000 on December 31, 2010 .
897077_12_ITEM7_P64_S1	The decrease was mainly from the Company s Agricultural Division.
897077_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	We test goodwill for impairment annually, at the reporting unit level, and whenever events or circumstances make it likely that an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell all or a portion of a reporting unit.
897077_12_ITEM7_P65_S1	We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis.
897077_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	Goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing a qualitative assessment or a two-step process.
897077_12_ITEM7_P66_S1	We have an option to make a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit's goodwill for impairment.
897077_12_ITEM7_P66_S2	If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary.
897077_12_ITEM7_P67_S0	For reporting units where we perform the two-step process, the first step requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill.
897077_12_ITEM7_P67_S1	If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not considered impaired.
897077_12_ITEM7_P67_S2	If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, there is an indication that an impairment may exist and the second step is required.
897077_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	In step two, the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities.
897077_12_ITEM7_P68_S1	If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill, the difference is recognized as an impairment loss.
897077_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis.
897077_12_ITEM7_P69_S1	This analysis requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates.
897077_12_ITEM7_P69_S2	The cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of time, which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to an even higher degree of uncertainty.
897077_12_ITEM7_P69_S3	The Company also utilizes market valuation models and other financial ratios, which require the Company to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to its assets and businesses.
897077_12_ITEM7_P70_S0	As of December 31, 2011 , goodwill was $ 31,751,000 , which represents 8% of total assets.
897077_12_ITEM7_P70_S1	The Company recognized goodwill impairment at two of its French operations, SMA and Rousseau , in the Company's European division of $1,898,000 in 2011 and no goodwill impairment in 2010.
897077_12_ITEM7_P70_S2	During the 2011 impairment analysis review, it was noted that even though the Schwarze, Rivard and Faucheux reporting unit s fair value was above carrying value it was not materially different.
897077_12_ITEM7_P70_S3	On December 31, 2011 , there was approximately $6.8 million, $11.6 million and $0.6 million of goodwill related to the Schwarze, Rivard and Faucheux reporting units respectively.
897077_12_ITEM7_P70_S4	These reporting units would be most likely affected by changes in the Company s assumptions and estimates.
897077_12_ITEM7_P70_S5	The calculation of fair value could increase or decrease depending on changes in the inputs and assumptions used, such as changes in the reporting unit s future growth rates, discount rates, etc.
897077_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	Management believes that the estimated valuations it arrived at are reasonable and consistent with what other marketplace participants would use in valuing the Company's components.
897077_12_ITEM7_P71_S1	However, management cannot give any assurance that these market values will not change in the future.
897077_12_ITEM7_P71_S2	For example, if discount rates demanded by the market increase, this could lead to reduced valuations under the income approach.
897077_12_ITEM7_P71_S3	If the Company's projections are not achieved in the future, this could lead management to reassess their assumptions and lead to reduced valuations under the income approach.
897077_12_ITEM7_P71_S4	If the market price of the Company's stock decreases, this could cause the Company to reassess the reasonableness of the implied control premium, which might cause management to assume a higher discount rate under the income approach which could lead to reduced valuations.
897077_12_ITEM7_P71_S5	If future similar transactions exhibit lower multiples than those observed in the past, this could lead to reduced valuations under the similar transactions approach.
897077_12_ITEM7_P71_S6	And finally, if there is a general decline in the stock market and particularly in those companies selected as comparable to the Company's components, this could lead to reduced valuations under the public company market multiple approach.
897077_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	The Company's annual impairment test is performed during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.
897077_12_ITEM7_P72_S1	Given the current market conditions and continued economic uncertainty, the fair value of the Company's components could deteriorate which could result in the need to record impairment charges in future periods.
897077_12_ITEM7_P72_S2	The Company also monitors potential triggering events including changes in the business climate in which it operates, attrition of key personnel, volatility in the capital markets, the Company's market capitalization compared to its book value, the Company's recent operating performance, and the Company's financial projections.
897077_12_ITEM7_P72_S3	The occurrence of one or more triggering events could require additional impairment testing, which could result in future impairment charges.
897077_12_ITEM7_P72_S4	In particular, since the Schwarze , Rivard and Faucheux , reporting unit's carrying value is not materially different from fair value, any changes to the Company's assumptions could lead to an indicated impairment in step one, requiring the Company to proceed to step two and potentially record an impairment charge.
897077_12_ITEM7_P72_S5	See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding goodwill.
897077_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The Company is exposed to various financial market risks.
897077_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates.
897077_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The Company does not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
897077_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	International Sales A portion of the Company s operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities in international jurisdictions.
897077_12_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The Company primarily manufactures its products in the United States, the U.K., France, Canada and Australia.
897077_12_ITEM7A_P2_S2	The Company sells its products primarily within the markets where the products are produced, but certain of the Company s sales from its U.K. operations are denominated in other European currencies.
897077_12_ITEM7A_P2_S3	As a result, the Company s financials, specifically the value of its foreign assets, could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the other markets in which the subsidiaries of the Company distribute their products.
897077_12_ITEM7A_P2_S4	To mitigate the short-term effect of changes in currency exchange rates on the Company s functional currency-based sales, the Company s U.K. subsidiaries regularly enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge over 90% of its future net foreign currency cash receipts over a period of six months.
897077_12_ITEM7A_P2_S5	As of December 31, 2011 , the Company had $ 3,460,000 outstanding in forward exchange contracts related to accounts receivable.
897077_12_ITEM7A_P2_S6	A 15% fluctuation in exchange rates for these currencies would change the fair value by approximately $ 519,000 .
897077_12_ITEM7A_P2_S7	However, since these contracts hedge foreign currency denominated transactions, any change in the fair value of the contracts should be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged.
897077_12_ITEM7A_P2_S8	On December 31, 2011 , the fair value of these agreements was in an unfavorable position; therefore, the derivative financial instruments were recorded as a gain of $ 102,000 , which has been recognized in other income (expense), net.
897077_12_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Exposure to Exchange Rates The Company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominantly in European countries, Canada and Australia, as a result of the sale of its products in international markets.
897077_12_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Foreign currency forward contracts in the U.K. are used to hedge against the earnings effects of such fluctuations.
897077_12_ITEM7A_P4_S0	On December 31, 2011 , the result of a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies in which the Company s sales are denominated would result in a decrease in gross profit of $ 4,816,000 .
897077_12_ITEM7A_P4_S1	Comparatively, on December 31, 2010 , the result of a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which the Company s sales are denominated would have resulted in a decrease in gross profit of approximately $ 4,435,000 .
897077_12_ITEM7A_P5_S0	This calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar.
897077_12_ITEM7A_P5_S1	In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, which are a changed dollar value of the resulting sales, changes in exchange rates may also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive.
897077_12_ITEM7A_P5_S2	The Company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices.
897077_12_ITEM7A_P5_S3	The translation adjustment during 2011 was a loss of $ 2,879,000 .
897077_12_ITEM7A_P6_S0	On December 31, 2011 , the British pound closed at 0.6434 relative to the U.S. dollar, and the Euro closed at 0.7716 relative to the U.S. dollar.
897077_12_ITEM7A_P6_S1	By comparison, on December 31, 2010 , the British pound closed at 0.6411 relative to the U.S. dollar, and the Euro closed at 0.7479 relative to the U.S. dollar.
897077_12_ITEM7A_P6_S2	No assurance can be given as to future valuation of the British pound or Euro or how further movements in those or other currencies could affect future earnings or the financial position of the Company.
897077_12_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Interest Rate Risk The majority of the Company s long-term debt bears interest at variable rates.
897077_12_ITEM7A_P7_S1	Accordingly, the Company s net income is affected by changes in interest rates.
897077_12_ITEM7A_P7_S2	Assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and a two hundred basis point change in the 2011 average interest rate under these borrowings, the Company s 2011 interest expense would have changed by approximately $ 140,000 .
897077_12_ITEM7A_P8_S0	In the event of an adverse change in interest rates, management could take actions to mitigate its exposure.
897077_12_ITEM7A_P9_S0	change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment.
897077_12_ITEM7A_P9_S1	However, the challenges affecting the banking industry and credit markets in general can potentially cause changes to credit availability which creates a level of uncertainty.

897077_12_ITEM15_P11_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

897077_12_ITEM15_P11_S4	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
897077_12_ITEM15_P12_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
897077_12_ITEM15_P12_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
897077_12_ITEM15_P13_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
897077_12_ITEM15_P13_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

897077_12_ITEM15_P32_S0	Depreciation is provided at amounts calculated to amortize the cost of the assets over their estimated useful economic lives using the straight-line method.
897077_12_ITEM15_P33_S0	Goodwill Goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of businesses acquired.
897077_12_ITEM15_P33_S1	We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis.
897077_12_ITEM15_P34_S0	Goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing a qualitative assessment or a two-step process.
897077_12_ITEM15_P34_S1	We have an option to make a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit's goodwill for impairment.
897077_12_ITEM15_P34_S2	If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary.
897077_12_ITEM15_P35_S0	For reporting units where we perform the two-step process, the first step requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill.
897077_12_ITEM15_P35_S1	If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not considered impaired.
897077_12_ITEM15_P35_S2	If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, there is an indication that an impairment may exist and the second step is required.
897077_12_ITEM15_P36_S0	In step two, the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities.
897077_12_ITEM15_P36_S1	If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill, the difference is recognized as an impairment loss.
897077_12_ITEM15_P37_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis.
897077_12_ITEM15_P37_S1	This analysis requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates.
897077_12_ITEM15_P37_S2	The cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of time, which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to an even higher degree of uncertainty.
897077_12_ITEM15_P37_S3	The Company also utilizes market valuation models and other financial ratios, which require the Company to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to its assets and businesses.
897077_12_ITEM15_P38_S0	As of December 31, 2011 , goodwill was $ 31,751,000 , which represents 8% of total assets.
897077_12_ITEM15_P38_S1	The Company recognized goodwill impairment at two of its French operations, SMA and Rousseau, in the Company's European division of $1,898,000 in 2011 and no goodwill impairment in 2010.
897077_12_ITEM15_P38_S2	During the 2011 impairment analysis review, it was noted that even though the Schwarze, Rivard and Faucheux reporting unit s fair value was above carrying value it was not materially different.
897077_12_ITEM15_P38_S3	On December 31, 2011 , there was approximately $6.8 million, $11.6million and $0.6 million of goodwill related to the Schwarze, Rivard and Faucheux reporting units respectively.
897077_12_ITEM15_P38_S4	These reporting units would be most likely affected by changes in the Company s assumptions and estimates.
897077_12_ITEM15_P38_S5	The calculation of fair value could increase or decrease depending on changes in the inputs and assumptions used, such as changes in the reporting unit s future growth rates, discount rates, etc.
897077_12_ITEM15_P39_S0	Management believes that the estimated valuations it arrived at are reasonable and consistent with what other marketplace participants would use in valuing the Company's components.
897077_12_ITEM15_P39_S1	However, management cannot give any assurance that these market values will not change in the future.
897077_12_ITEM15_P39_S2	For example, if discount rates demanded by the market increase, this could lead to reduced valuations under the income approach.
897077_12_ITEM15_P39_S3	If the Company's projections are not achieved in the future, this could lead management to reassess their assumptions and lead to reduced valuations under the income approach.
897077_12_ITEM15_P39_S4	If the market price of the Company's stock decreases, this could cause the Company to reassess the reasonableness of the implied control premium, which might cause management to assume a higher discount rate under the income approach which could lead to reduced valuations.
897077_12_ITEM15_P39_S5	If future similar transactions exhibit lower multiples than those observed in the past, this could lead to reduced valuations under the similar transactions approach.
897077_12_ITEM15_P40_S0	The Company's annual impairment test is performed during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.
897077_12_ITEM15_P40_S1	Given the current market conditions and continued economic uncertainty, the fair value of the Company's components could deteriorate which could result in the need to record impairment charges in future periods.
897077_12_ITEM15_P40_S2	The Company also monitors potential triggering events including changes in the business climate in which it operates, attrition of key personnel, volatility in the capital markets, the Company's market capitalization compared to its book value, the Company's recent operating performance, and the Company's financial projections.
897077_12_ITEM15_P40_S3	The occurrence of one or more triggering events could require additional impairment testing, which could result in future impairment charges.
897077_12_ITEM15_P40_S4	In particular, since the Schwarze, Rivard and Faucheux, reporting unit's carrying value is not materially different from fair value, any changes to the Company's assumptions could lead to an indicated impairment in step one, requiring the Company to proceed to step two and potentially record an impairment charge.
897077_12_ITEM15_P40_S5	See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding goodwill.
897077_12_ITEM15_P41_S0	Intangible Assets The Company s definite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names.
897077_12_ITEM15_P41_S1	The net book value of the trademarks was $ 5,500,000 as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 .
897077_12_ITEM15_P41_S2	During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company wrote off $224,000 in older patents which the Company believes no longer provide a competitive advantage.
897077_12_ITEM15_P41_S3	Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives not subject to amortization consist of the Gradall trade name valued at $3,600,000 and the Bush Hog trade name valued at $1,900,000 on December 31, 2011 .
897077_12_ITEM15_P41_S4	The Company tests its indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis at year-end, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset could be below its carrying amount.
897077_12_ITEM15_P41_S5	The impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, determined using the relief from royalty method, with its carrying amount.
897077_12_ITEM15_P41_S6	An impairment loss would be recognized for the carrying amount in excess of its fair value.
897077_12_ITEM15_P42_S0	Identifiable intangible assets are recorded at estimated cost.
897077_12_ITEM15_P42_S1	Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
897077_12_ITEM15_P43_S0	Pensions In connection with the February 3, 2006 purchase of all the net assets of the Gradall excavator business, the Company assumed sponsorship of two Gradall non-contributory defined benefit pension plans, both of which were frozen with respect to both future benefit accruals and future new entrants.
897077_12_ITEM15_P44_S0	The Gradall Company Hourly Employees Pension Plan covers approximately 330 former employees and 150 current employees who (i) were formerly employed by JLG Industries, Inc., (ii) were covered by a collective bargaining agreement and (iii) first participated in the plan before April 6, 1997.
897077_12_ITEM15_P44_S1	An amendment ceasing all future benefit accruals was effective April 6, 1997.
897077_12_ITEM15_P45_S0	The Gradall Company Employees Retirement Plan covers approximately 235 former employees and 94 current employees who (i) were formerly employed by JLG Industries, Inc., (ii) were not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and (iii) first participated in the plan before December 31, 2004.
897077_12_ITEM15_P45_S1	An amendment ceasing future benefit accruals for certain participants was effective December 31, 2004.
897077_12_ITEM15_P45_S2	A second amendment discontinued all future benefit accruals for all participants effective April 24, 2006.
897077_12_ITEM15_P46_S0	The Company recognizes the funded status of the defined benefit pension plans as a liability in its statement of financial position and recognizes any changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through other comprehensive income.
897077_12_ITEM15_P47_S0	Related Party Transactions There were no reportable relationships or related party transactions for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 .
897077_12_ITEM15_P48_S0	During 1999, the Company approved a supplemental retirement benefit for Donald J. Douglass which is paid on a quarterly basis over a period of fourteen and one-half years that began in the year 2000.
897077_12_ITEM15_P49_S0	and Other long-term liabilities sections of the Company s consolidated balance sheet.
897077_12_ITEM15_P50_S0	The Company recognizes revenue when each of the following four criteria are met: 1) a contract or sales arrangement exists; 2) products have been shipped per agreed terms and title has been transferred or services have been rendered; 3) the prices of the products or services are fixed or determinable; and 4) collectability is reasonably assured.
897077_12_ITEM15_P51_S0	Pre-season sales orders are solicited in the fall in advance of the dealer s sales season in the spring and summer.
897077_12_ITEM15_P51_S1	Pre-season sales orders are shipped beginning in the fall and continuing through the spring and represent an opportunity for the Company s factories to level their production/shipping volumes through the winter months.
897077_12_ITEM15_P51_S2	These pre-season shipments carry descending discounts in conjunction with delayed payment terms of up to six months from the dealer s requested delivery date.
897077_12_ITEM15_P52_S0	Revenue from sales is recorded net of a provision for discounts that are anticipated to be earned and deducted at time of payment by the customer.
897077_12_ITEM15_P52_S1	These approximated discounts represent an average of historical amounts taken and are adjusted as program terms are changed.
897077_12_ITEM15_P52_S2	The reserves for discounts are reviewed and adjusted quarterly.
897077_12_ITEM15_P52_S3	From time to time, revenue is recognized under a bill and hold arrangement.
897077_12_ITEM15_P52_S4	Revenue recognized under bill and hold arrangements for 2011, 2010, and 2009 was immaterial.
897077_12_ITEM15_P53_S0	The Company capitalizes certain costs associated with the development and installation of internal use software.
897077_12_ITEM15_P53_S1	Internal use software costs are expensed or capitalized depending on whether they are incurred in the preliminary project stage, application development stage or the post-implementation stage.
897077_12_ITEM15_P53_S2	Amounts capitalized are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software.
897077_12_ITEM15_P54_S0	The book value of capitalized software net of depreciation is approximately $ 1,320,000 and $ 1,779,000 on December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 , respectively.
897077_12_ITEM15_P54_S1	$ 749,000 and $ 721,000 in 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively.
897077_12_ITEM15_P55_S0	Internal use software is amortized for financial reporting purposes using the straight-line method over the estimated life of two to seven years.
897077_12_ITEM15_P56_S0	The Company s policy is to include shipping and handling costs in costs of goods sold.
897077_12_ITEM15_P57_S0	Advertising We charge advertising costs to expense as incurred.
897077_12_ITEM15_P57_S1	Advertising and marketing expense related to operations for fiscal years 2011 , 2010 and 2009 was approximately $ 6,441,000 , $ 5,135,000 and $ 4,378,000 , respectively.
897077_12_ITEM15_P57_S2	Advertising and marketing expenses are included in Selling, General and Administrative expenses ( SG A ).
897077_12_ITEM15_P57_S3	Research and Development Product development and engineering costs charged to SG A amounted to $ 6,017,000 , $ 5,774,000 , and $ 4,762,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively.
897077_12_ITEM15_P57_S4	Legal Costs The Company s policy is to accrue for legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with loss contingencies.
897077_12_ITEM15_P58_S0	Federal Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to the future years in which deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized.
897077_12_ITEM15_P59_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.
897077_12_ITEM15_P59_S1	The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.
897077_12_ITEM15_P59_S2	Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.
897077_12_ITEM15_P59_S3	Based upon projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences.
897077_12_ITEM15_P60_S0	We do not provide for a U.S. income tax liability on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.
897077_12_ITEM15_P60_S1	The earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, which reflect full provision for non-U.S. income taxes, are currently indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. operations.
897077_12_ITEM15_P61_S0	Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted the new provisions of ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, which address the recognition and measurement of (i) identifiable assets acquired or liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, and (ii) goodwill acquired or gain from a bargain purchase.
897077_12_ITEM15_P61_S1	In addition, acquisition-related costs are accounted for as expenses in the period in which the costs are incurred and the services are received.
897077_12_ITEM15_P61_S2	These provisions were applied to the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of Bush Hog LLC in the fourth quarter of 2009 and Tenco in the fourth quarter of 2011, which is discussed in Note 20.
897077_12_ITEM15_P62_S0	We are using the modified-prospective transition method; however, for unvested equity awards outstanding we continue to amortize those awards using the minimum value method.
897077_12_ITEM15_P63_S0	Measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors is recognized based on estimated fair values.
897077_12_ITEM15_P64_S0	We use the Black-Scholes pricing model to determine the fair value of the stock options on the grant dates for stock awards made and we amortize the fair value of share-based payments on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the award, which is generally the vesting period.
897077_12_ITEM15_P65_S0	The Black-Scholes valuation model requires us to make assumptions and judgments about the variables used in the calculation.
897077_12_ITEM15_P65_S1	These variables and assumptions include the fair value of our common stock, expected term, the expected volatility, the risk-free interest rate, expected dividends, and the estimated rate of forfeitures of unvested stock options.
897077_12_ITEM15_P66_S0	The Company calculated the fair value for options using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions for 2011 , 2010 , and 2009 :
897077_12_ITEM15_P67_S0	In January 2010, the provisions of ASC Topic 820 were modified to require additional disclosures, including transfers in and out of Level 1 and 2 fair value measurements and the gross basis presentation of the reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements.
897077_12_ITEM15_P67_S1	This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for disclosures related to Level 3 fair value measurements, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010 (including interim periods).
897077_12_ITEM15_P67_S2	We have adopted all of these provisions of ASC Topic 820 effective December 31, 2009.
897077_12_ITEM15_P67_S3	Since only disclosures are affected by these requirements, the adoption of these provisions did not affect our financial position or results of operations.
897077_12_ITEM15_P68_S0	The following table sets forth the reconciliation from basic to diluted average common shares and the calculations of net income per common share.
897077_12_ITEM15_P68_S1	Net income for basic and diluted calculations does not differ.
897077_12_ITEM15_P69_S0	Stock options totaling 78,337 shares in 2011 , 133,700 shares in 2010 , and 304,533 shares in 2009 were not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
897077_12_ITEM15_P70_S0	3. VALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS Valuation and qualifying accounts included the following:
897077_12_ITEM15_P71_S0	The Company evaluates the collectability of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors.
897077_12_ITEM15_P71_S1	In circumstances where it is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations, the Company records a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what it believes will be collected.
897077_12_ITEM15_P71_S2	For all other customers, it recognizes reserves for bad debt based on historical experience of bad debts as a percent of revenues for each business unit, adjusted for relative improvements or deteriorations in the aging and changes in current economic conditions.
897077_12_ITEM15_P72_S0	The Company evaluates all receivables that are over 60 days old and will reserve specifically on a 90-day basis.
897077_12_ITEM15_P73_S0	The Company has a secured or insured interest on most of its wholegoods that each customer purchases.
897077_12_ITEM15_P73_S1	This allows the Company, in times of a difficult economy when the customer is unable to pay or has filed for bankruptcy (usually Chapter 11), to repossess the customer s inventory.
897077_12_ITEM15_P73_S2	This also allows Alamo Group to maintain only a reserve over its cost, which usually represents the margin on the original sales price.
897077_12_ITEM15_P74_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $ 3,215,000 on December 31, 2011 , and $ 2,852,000 on December 31, 2010 .
897077_12_ITEM15_P74_S1	The increase was mainly from the Company s Industrial and European operations.
897077_12_ITEM15_P75_S0	On December 31, 2011 , the Company had $ 14,567,000 in reserves for sales discounts compared to $ 11,903,000 on December 31, 2010 on product shipped to our customers under various promotional programs.
897077_12_ITEM15_P75_S1	The increase was due primarily to higher sales activity of the Company s agricultural products during the pre-season, which runs from September to December of each year with orders shipped through the first quarter of 2011.
897077_12_ITEM15_P76_S0	The Company reviews the reserve quarterly based on analysis made on each program outstanding at the time.
897077_12_ITEM15_P77_S0	Historically, between 85% and 95% of the Company s customers who qualify for each program actually take the discount that is available.
897077_12_ITEM15_P78_S0	The Company had a reserve of $ 7,630,000 on December 31, 2011 and $ 7,506,000 on December 31, 2010 to cover obsolete and slow moving inventory.
897077_12_ITEM15_P78_S1	The increase in the reserve was mainly from the Company s U.S. operations.
897077_12_ITEM15_P79_S0	The obsolete and slow moving inventory policy states that the reserve is to be calculated as follows: 1) no inventory usage over a three-year period is deemed obsolete and reserved at 100 percent; and 2) slow moving inventory with little usage requires a 100 percent reserve on items that have a quantity greater than a three-year supply.
897077_12_ITEM15_P79_S1	There are exceptions to the obsolete and slow moving classifications if approved by an officer of the Company, based on specific identification of an item or items that are deemed to be either included or excluded from this classification.
897077_12_ITEM15_P79_S2	In cases where there is no historical data, management makes a judgment based on a specific review of the inventory in question to determine what reserves, if any, are appropriate.
897077_12_ITEM15_P79_S3	New products or parts are generally excluded from the reserve policy until a three-year history has been established.
897077_12_ITEM15_P80_S0	The Company s warranty policy is generally to provide its customers warranty for up to one year on all wholegood units and 90 days on parts though some components can have warranty for longer terms.
897077_12_ITEM15_P81_S0	Warranty reserve, as a percentage of sales, is generally calculated by looking at the current twelve months expenses and prorating that amount based on twelve months sales with a ninety-day to six-month lag period.
897077_12_ITEM15_P81_S1	The Company s historical experience is that an end-user takes approximately 90 days to six months from the receipt of the unit to file a warranty claim.
897077_12_ITEM15_P81_S2	A warranty reserve is established for each different marketing group.
897077_12_ITEM15_P81_S3	Reserve balances are evaluated on a quarterly basis and adjustments made when required.
897077_12_ITEM15_P82_S0	The current liability warranty reserve balance was $ 5,313,000 on December 31, 2011 and $ 5,554,000 on December 31, 2010 .
897077_12_ITEM15_P82_S1	The decrease was mainly from the Company s Agricultural Division.
897077_12_ITEM15_P83_S0	Inventories valued at LIFO represented 61% and 63% of total inventory for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
897077_12_ITEM15_P83_S1	The excess of current costs over LIFO-valued inventories was $ 9,459,000 and $ 7,654,000 on December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 , respectively.
897077_12_ITEM15_P83_S2	(The $ 1,805,000 increase in LIFO reserve during 2011 came from increases in inventory levels within U.S. operations.
897077_12_ITEM15_P83_S3	Inventories consisted of the following on a cost basis, net of reserves:
897077_12_ITEM15_P84_S0	PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment consist of the following:
897077_12_ITEM15_P85_S0	Property, plant and equipment on December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 include $ 16,772,000 and $ 16,955,000 , respectively, for items listed above that are held under capital leases.
897077_12_ITEM15_P85_S1	Accumulated depreciation relating to the capital leases on December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $ 8,003,000 and $ 7,428,000 , respectively.
897077_12_ITEM15_P85_S2	Amortization related to the capital lease is included in depreciation expense.
897077_12_ITEM15_P86_S0	The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 , 2010 and 2011 are as follows:
897077_12_ITEM15_P87_S0	ACCRUED LIABILITIES Accrued liabilities consist of the following balances:
897077_12_ITEM15_P88_S0	LONG-TERM DEBT The components of long-term debt are as follows:
897077_12_ITEM15_P89_S0	On November 6, 2009, the Company entered into the Seventh Amendment of the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., BBVA Compass Bank, and Rabobank, as its lenders.
897077_12_ITEM15_P89_S1	The revolving credit line remained at $125.0 million.
897077_12_ITEM15_P89_S2	Prior to the execution of this Amendment, BBVA Compass Bank acquired certain assets of Guaranty Bank which included this credit facility, and JPMorgan Chase Bank assigned its interest to Well Fargo Bank, N.A.
897077_12_ITEM15_P89_S3	The purpose of the amendment was to add Bush Hog as a member of the Obligated Group and pledge a first priority security interest in certain U.S. assets (accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, trademarks and trade names) of the Borrower and each member of the Obligated Group.
897077_12_ITEM15_P89_S4	The Lenders agreed to increase the operating leverage ratio during the next three quarters and to add a new EBIT to Interest Expense covenant in exchange for a commitment fee and an increase in the Applicable Interest Margin over LIBOR or Prime Rate advances.
897077_12_ITEM15_P90_S0	On March 28, 2011, the Company entered into the Eighth Amendment of Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement (the Eighth Credit Agreement Amendment ), by and among the Company, the lenders party thereto and Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent.
897077_12_ITEM15_P90_S1	The Eighth Credit Agreement Amendment amends certain provisions of the Company s existing credit facility to, among other things, (i) release the previously pledged security interest in certain assets of the Company and its specified subsidiaries which secured any indebtedness under the existing credit facility, (ii) extend the termination date of the Company s credit facility to March 28, 2016, (iii) reduce the aggregate commitments to $100,000,000, (iv) provide the Company the option to request an increase in aggregate commitments under the existing credit facility of up to $50,000,000, subject to the conditions set forth therein (v) lower the applicable leverage ratio, subject to certain exceptions and conditions, (vi) modify the limitation on capital expenditure, (vii) modify the limitation on other indebtedness and (viii) decrease the applicable interest margin for specified advances.
897077_12_ITEM15_P91_S0	As of December 31, 2011 , there was $ 7,000,000 borrowed under the revolving credit facility.
897077_12_ITEM15_P92_S0	On May 13, 2008, Alamo Group Europe Limited expanded its annual overdraft facility with Lloyd s TSB Bank plc from 1.0 million to 5.5 million .
897077_12_ITEM15_P92_S1	The facility was renewed on October 29, 2011 and outstandings currently bear interest at Lloyd s Base Rate plus 1.4% per annum.
897077_12_ITEM15_P92_S2	The facility is unsecured but guaranteed by the U.K. subsidiaries of Alamo Group Europe Limited.
897077_12_ITEM15_P92_S3	As of December 31, 2011 , there were no outstanding balances in British pounds borrowed against the U.K. overdraft facility.

897077_12_ITEM15_P94_S0	As of December 31, 2011 , the Company is in compliance with the terms and conditions of its credit facilities.
897077_12_ITEM15_P95_S0	The aggregate maturities of long-term debt, as of December 31, 2011 , are as follows: $ 1,190,000 in 2012 ; $ 492,000 in 2013 ; $ 335,000 in 2014 ; $ 242,000 in 2015 ; $ 7,241,000 in 2016 ; and $ 311,000 thereafter.
897077_12_ITEM15_P96_S0	The fair value of the Company s debt is based on secondary market indicators.
897077_12_ITEM15_P96_S1	Since the Company s debt is not quoted, estimates are based on each obligation s characteristics, including remaining maturities, interest rate, credit rating, collateral, amortization schedule and liquidity.
897077_12_ITEM15_P96_S2	The carrying amount approximates fair value.
897077_12_ITEM15_P97_S0	DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING Most of the Company s outstanding debt is advanced from a revolving credit facility that accrues interest at a contractual margin over current market interest rates.
897077_12_ITEM15_P97_S1	The Company s financing costs associated with this credit facility can materially change with market increases and decreases of short-term borrowing rates, specifically London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ).
897077_12_ITEM15_P98_S0	During the second quarter of 2007, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements with JPMorgan that hedge future cash flows related to its outstanding debt obligations.
897077_12_ITEM15_P98_S1	One swap had a three-year term and fixed the LIBOR base rate at 4.910% covering $ 20 million of this debt, which expired on March 31, 2010.
897077_12_ITEM15_P98_S2	The other had a four-year term and fixed the LIBOR base rate at 4.935% covering an additional $ 20 million of these variable rate borrowings and expired on March 31, 2011.
897077_12_ITEM15_P98_S3	At December 31, 2011 there was zero liability related to the expired interest rate swaps.
897077_12_ITEM15_P99_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
897077_12_ITEM15_P100_S0	There is a three-tier fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs used in valuation techniques.
897077_12_ITEM15_P100_S1	Observable inputs (highest level) reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs (lowest level) reflect internally developed market assumptions.
897077_12_ITEM15_P100_S2	In Fair value measurements are classified under the following hierarchy:
897077_12_ITEM15_P101_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
897077_12_ITEM15_P101_S1	Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs or significant value-drivers are observable in active markets.
897077_12_ITEM15_P102_S0	When available, the Company uses quoted market prices to determine fair value, and the Company classifies such measurements within Level 1.
897077_12_ITEM15_P102_S1	In some cases where market prices are not available, the Company makes use of observable market-based inputs to calculate fair value, in which case the measurements are classified with Level 2.
897077_12_ITEM15_P103_S0	use, where possible, current market-based parameters such as interest rates, yield curves, currency rates, etc.
897077_12_ITEM15_P103_S1	These measurements are classified within Level 3.
897077_12_ITEM15_P104_S0	Fair value measurements are classified to the lowest level input or value-driver that is significant to the valuation.
897077_12_ITEM15_P104_S1	A measurement may therefore be classified within Level 3 even though there may be significant inputs that are readily observable.
897077_12_ITEM15_P105_S0	The jurisdictional components of income before taxes consist of the following:
897077_12_ITEM15_P106_S0	The components of income tax expense (benefit) consist of the following:
897077_12_ITEM15_P107_S0	The difference between income tax expense (benefit) for financial statement purposes and the amount of income tax expense computed by applying the domestic statutory income tax rate of 34% to income loss before income taxes consist of the following:
897077_12_ITEM15_P108_S0	Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis.
897077_12_ITEM15_P108_S1	The components of the Company s deferred income tax assets and liabilities consist of the following:
897077_12_ITEM15_P109_S0	As of December 31, 2011 , the Company had foreign deferred tax assets consisting of foreign net operating losses and other tax benefits available to reduce future taxable income in a foreign jurisdiction.
897077_12_ITEM15_P109_S1	These foreign jurisdictions' net operating loss carryforwards are in the approximate amount of $4.9 million with an unlimited carryforward period.
897077_12_ITEM15_P109_S2	The Company also has U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards in the approximate amount of $5.6 million which expire from 2014 to 2028.
897077_12_ITEM15_P110_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
897077_12_ITEM15_P110_S1	Based on the expectation of future taxable income and that the deductible temporary differences will offset existing taxable temporary differences, the Company believes it is more likely than not that it will realize the benefits of these deductible differences.
897077_12_ITEM15_P111_S0	Deferred income taxes have not been provided on the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases of the Company s foreign subsidiaries, based on the determination that such differences are essentially permanent in duration in that the earnings of the subsidiaries are expected to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations.
897077_12_ITEM15_P111_S1	As of December 31, 2011 , the cumulative undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries approximated $ 115,625,000 .
897077_12_ITEM15_P111_S2	If these earnings were not considered indefinitely reinvested, deferred income taxes would have been recorded after the consideration of foreign tax credits.
897077_12_ITEM15_P111_S3	At this time, it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional income taxes that might be payable on those earnings, if distributed.
897077_12_ITEM15_P112_S0	The Company adopted the provisions of FASB ASC Section 740-10-25 (formerly FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes ) on January 1, 2007.

897077_12_ITEM15_P114_S1	The Company has recorded an unrecognized tax benefit in the amount of $193,000 as of December 31, 2010.
897077_12_ITEM15_P114_S2	In 2011, the Company recorded an additional R D tax credit of $252,000 for federal and $164,000 for state, and recorded an additional unrecognized tax benefit of approximately $42,000 that if recognized would affect our annual effective tax rate.
897077_12_ITEM15_P114_S3	We do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next 12 months.
897077_12_ITEM15_P115_S0	The Company adopted the policy to include interest and penalty expense related to income taxes as interest and other expense, respectively.
897077_12_ITEM15_P115_S1	As of December 31, 2011 , no interest or penalties has been or is required to be accrued.

897077_12_ITEM15_P131_S0	The following tables set forth the change in plan assets, change in projected benefit obligation, rate assumptions and components of net periodic benefit cost as of December 31 with respect to these plans.
897077_12_ITEM15_P131_S1	The measurement dates of the assets and liabilities of both plans were December 31 of the respective years presented.
897077_12_ITEM15_P132_S0	The Company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status (i.e., the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations) of defined benefit postretirement plans as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognized changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur.
897077_12_ITEM15_P132_S1	The Company measures the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year-end statement of financial position.
897077_12_ITEM15_P133_S0	The underfunded status of the plan of $10,792,000 and $7,151,000 as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 , respectively, is recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as long-term accrued pension liability because plan assets are less than the value of benefit obligations expected to be paid.
897077_12_ITEM15_P134_S0	The accumulated benefit obligation for our pension plans represents the actuarial present value of benefits based on employee service and compensation as of a certain date and does not include an assumption about future compensation levels.
897077_12_ITEM15_P135_S0	In determining the projected benefit obligation and the net pension cost, we used the following significant weighted-average assumptions:
897077_12_ITEM15_P136_S0	Assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31:
897077_12_ITEM15_P137_S0	Assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December 31:
897077_12_ITEM15_P138_S0	The Company employs a building block approach in determining the expected long-term rate on return on plan assets.
897077_12_ITEM15_P138_S1	Historical markets are studied and long-term historical relationships between equities and fixed income are preserved consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run.
897077_12_ITEM15_P138_S2	Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term market assumptions are determined.
897077_12_ITEM15_P138_S3	The long-term portfolio return is established via a building block approach with proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing.
897077_12_ITEM15_P138_S4	Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness.
897077_12_ITEM15_P139_S0	The following tables present the components of net periodic benefit cost (gains are denoted with parentheses and losses are not):
897077_12_ITEM15_P140_S0	The Company estimates that $ 659,000 of unrecognized actuarial expense will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit costs during 2012 .
897077_12_ITEM15_P141_S0	The Company employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk.
897077_12_ITEM15_P141_S1	Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condition.
897077_12_ITEM15_P142_S0	The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income investments.
897077_12_ITEM15_P142_S1	Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks, as well as growth, value, and small and large capitalizations.
897077_12_ITEM15_P142_S2	Other assets such as real estate, private equity, and hedge funds are used judiciously to enhance long-term returns while improving portfolio diversification.
897077_12_ITEM15_P142_S3	Derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely manner; however, derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of the underlying investments.
897077_12_ITEM15_P143_S0	Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements, and periodic asset/liability studies.
897077_12_ITEM15_P144_S0	The pension plans' weighted-average asset allocations as a percentage of plan assets at December 31 are as follows:
897077_12_ITEM15_P145_S0	As of December 31, 2011 , we used the following valuation techniques to measure fair value for assets.
897077_12_ITEM15_P145_S1	There were no changes to these methodologies during 2011 :
897077_12_ITEM15_P146_S0	Level 1 - Assets were valued using the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual security was traded.
897077_12_ITEM15_P146_S1	Level 2 - Assets were valued using quoted prices in markets that are not active, broker dealer quotations, net asset value of shares held by the plans, and other methods by which all significant input were observable at the measurement date.
897077_12_ITEM15_P146_S2	Level 3 - Assets were valued using valuation reports from the respective institutions at the measurement date.
897077_12_ITEM15_P146_S3	The following table presents the hierarchy levels for our postretirement benefit plan investments as of December 31, :
897077_12_ITEM15_P147_S0	Our interests in the common collective trust investments are managed by one custodian.
897077_12_ITEM15_P147_S1	Consistent with our investment strategy, the custodian has invested the assets across a widely diversified portfolio of U.S. and international equity and fixed income securities.
897077_12_ITEM15_P147_S2	Fair values of each security within the collective trust as of December 31, 2011 were obtained from the custodian and are based on quoted market prices of individual investments; however, since the fund itself does not have immediate liquidity or a quoted market price, these assets are considered Level 2.
897077_12_ITEM15_P148_S0	The common collective funds noted in the above table have estimated fair value using the net asset value per share of investments.
897077_12_ITEM15_P148_S1	Investments can be redeemed immediately at the current net asset value per share based on the fair value of the underlying assets.
897077_12_ITEM15_P149_S0	The categories contain investments in equity securities of smaller growing companies, medium-sized U.S. companies, large value-oriented and growth-oriented companies and foreign companies traded on international markets.
897077_12_ITEM15_P150_S0	Expected benefit payments are estimated using the same assumptions used in determining our benefit obligation as of December 31, 2011 .
897077_12_ITEM15_P150_S1	The following table illustrates the estimated pension benefit payments which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, that are projected to be paid:
897077_12_ITEM15_P151_S0	The Board of Directors of the Company adopted the Alamo Group Inc. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the SERP ), effective as of January 3, 2011.
897077_12_ITEM15_P151_S1	The SERP will benefit certain key management or other highly compensated employees of the Company and/or certain subsidiaries who are selected by the Compensation Committee and approved by the Board to participate.
897077_12_ITEM15_P152_S0	The SERP is intended to provide a benefit from the Company upon retirement, death or disability, or a change in control of the Company.
897077_12_ITEM15_P152_S1	Accordingly, the SERP obligates the Company to pay to a participant a Retirement Benefit (as defined in the SERP) upon the occurrence of certain payment events to the extent a participant has a vested right thereto.
897077_12_ITEM15_P152_S2	A participant s right to his or her Retirement Benefit becomes vested in the Company s contributions upon 10 years of Credited Service (as defined in the SERP) or a change in control of the Company.
897077_12_ITEM15_P152_S3	The Retirement Benefit is based on 20% of the final three-year average salary of each participant on or after his or her normal retirement age (65 years of age).
897077_12_ITEM15_P152_S4	In the event of the participant s death or a change in control, the participant s vested retirement benefit will be paid in a lump sum to the participant or his or her estate, as applicable, within 90 days after the participant s death or a change in control, as applicable.
897077_12_ITEM15_P152_S5	In the event the participant is entitled to a benefit from the SERP due to disability, retirement or other termination of employment, the benefit will be paid in monthly installments over a period of fifteen years.
897077_12_ITEM15_P153_S0	The Company records amounts relating to the SERP based on calculations that incorporate various actuarial and other assumptions, including discount rates, rate of compensation increases, retirement dates and life expectancies.
897077_12_ITEM15_P153_S1	The net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn the SERP benefits.
897077_12_ITEM15_P154_S0	In connection with the initiation of the SERP, the Company recorded an unfunded long-term liability of $1,964,301 , a deferred tax asset of $746,000 and $1,218,301 in accumulated other comprehensive income.
897077_12_ITEM15_P154_S1	The $1,964,301 represents prior service cost which will be amortized over the average remaining service periods of the employees.
897077_12_ITEM15_P154_S2	The prior service cost is included as a component of net periodic pension cost.
897077_12_ITEM15_P154_S3	The prior service cost expected to be amortized for the year ended December 31, 2011 is $263,665 .
897077_12_ITEM15_P155_S0	The change in the Projected Benefit Obligation (BPO) as of December 31, 2011 is shown below in thousands:
897077_12_ITEM15_P156_S0	The components of net periodic pension expense were as follows in thousands:

897077_12_ITEM15_P184_S1	( "Tenco" ) located in St. Valerien, Quebec, Canada.
897077_12_ITEM15_P184_S2	The purchase price was approximately $5.9 million and included substantially all of the ongoing business of Tenco, including the Tenco brand name and all related product names and trademarks (the "Acquisition").
897077_12_ITEM15_P184_S3	The Acquisition was accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations ( ASC Topic 805 ).
897077_12_ITEM15_P184_S4	Accordingly, the total purchase price was allocated on a provisional basis to assets acquired and net liabilities assumed in connection with the Acquisition based on their estimated fair values as of the completion of the Acquisition.
897077_12_ITEM15_P184_S5	These allocations reflected various provisional estimates that were available at the time and are subject to change during the purchase price allocation period as valuations are finalized.
897077_12_ITEM15_P184_S6	The fair value of the net assets acquired was approximately $13.6 million, which exceeds the preliminary estimated purchase price of approximately $5.9 million.
897077_12_ITEM15_P184_S7	Accordingly, the Company recognized the excess of the fair value of the net assets over the purchase price of approximately $7.7 million as a gain on bargain purchase.
897077_12_ITEM15_P184_S8	The gain on bargain purchase of approximately $7.7 million was shown separately within income from operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
897077_12_ITEM15_P184_S9	The Company continues to evaluate the purchase price allocation including the opening fair value of inventory, accounts receivable, property plant and equipment, accrued liabilities and deferred taxes which may require the Company to adjust the recorded amount.
897077_12_ITEM15_P185_S0	Tenco's Canadian operations had been operating under Receivership Orders from the Quebec Superior Court since July 25, 2011 and (ii) Tenco had no additional working capital to pay their vendors timely and could not operate the business in order to service their customers in the ordinary course of business.
897077_12_ITEM15_P186_S0	Tenco was an unprofitable venture, and the seller approached the Company in an effort to sell Tenco.
897077_12_ITEM15_P186_S1	With Tenco in receivership, the only options, in our opinion, available were to sell the business below market value or shut Tenco down and sell off the business in pieces which, we believe, would have been more costly and time consuming.
897077_12_ITEM15_P186_S2	As a result, the Company was able to agree on a favorable purchase price.
897077_12_ITEM15_P186_S3	The primary reason for the Tenco acquisition was to provide the opportunity to expand the Company's presence in the snow removal equipment business in North America, particularly Canada and North East U.S.
897077_12_ITEM15_P186_S4	This acquisition complemented and broadened our range of products in this sector.
897077_12_ITEM15_P187_S0	The following table summarizes the provisional amount recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the Closing Date.
897077_12_ITEM15_P188_S0	A single estimate of fair value results from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and relies heavily on estimates and assumptions.
897077_12_ITEM15_P188_S1	The Company's judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact the Company's results of operations.

897077_12_ITEM15_P188_S3	The Company will finalize the amounts recognized as information necessary to complete the analysis is obtained.
897077_12_ITEM15_P188_S4	The Company expects to finalize these amounts as soon as possible but no later than one year from the acquisition date.
897077_12_ITEM15_P188_S5	The following are estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the Acquisition date (in thousands):
897077_12_ITEM15_P189_S0	Under 805-10, acquisition related costs (i.e., advisory, legal, valuation and other professional fees) are not included as a component of consideration transferred, but are accounted for as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred.
897077_12_ITEM15_P189_S1	The Company incurred $0.6 million of acquisition related costs in 2011.
897077_12_ITEM15_P189_S2	Assuming this transaction had been made at the beginning of any period presented, the consolidated pro-forma results would not be materially different from reported results.
897077_12_ITEM15_P190_S0	In the period between the Closing Date and December 31, 2011, Tenco generated approximately $7.0 million of net revenue and $0.2 million net income.

897077_12_ITEM15_P191_S1	The purchase included substantially all of the ongoing business of Bush Hog, including the Bush Hog brand name and all related product names and trademarks (the Acquisition ).
897077_12_ITEM15_P191_S2	The purchase price consideration was 1.7 million unregistered shares, with certain registration rights, of Alamo Group common stock which represented approximately 14.5% of the outstanding stock of Alamo Group.
897077_12_ITEM15_P191_S3	Because the restricted stock was issued in an unregistered private transaction, resale of the shares is restricted and the shares may be resold only if registered or sold in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, including pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act.
897077_12_ITEM15_P191_S4	Under Rule 144, the restricted stock was subject to, among other things, an initial 6-month holding period before any of the shares could be sold in the public market.
897077_12_ITEM15_P191_S5	Accordingly, the fair value of the 1.7 million shares was based on the public market price of Alamo common stock less a discount for lack of marketability associated with the 6-month holding period.
897077_12_ITEM15_P191_S6	We utilized an Asian put option model to measure the discount for lack of marketability.
897077_12_ITEM15_P192_S0	An Asian put option is an option that entitles the holder to a payoff based on the average price of an underlying asset, over a predetermined period.

897077_12_ITEM15_P192_S2	The fair value of the net assets acquired was approximately $53.1 million, which exceeded the preliminary estimated purchase price of $25.4 million.
897077_12_ITEM15_P192_S3	Accordingly, the Company recognized the excess of the fair value of the net assets over the purchase price of approximately $27.7 million as a gain on bargain purchase.
897077_12_ITEM15_P192_S4	The Company evaluated the purchase price allocation during 2010, including the opening fair value of inventory, accounts receivable, property, plant equipment, accrued liabilities and deferred taxes, which required the Company to adjust the recorded gain by $2.5 million to a total final gain on bargain purchase of $30.2 million.

897077_13_ITEM1_P62_S2	The decrease in 2012 was mainly from lower replacement part sales in the Company's European division which was due to the weak economy that continues to affect Europe.

897077_13_ITEM1_P64_S0	While the Company believes that the end-users of its products evaluate their purchases on the basis of price, reputation and product quality, such purchases are also based on a dealer s service, support of and loyalty to the dealer based on previous purchase experiences, as well as other factors such as product and replacement part availability.
897077_13_ITEM1_P65_S0	The Company s ability to provide innovative responses to customer needs, to develop and manufacture new products, and to enhance existing product lines is important to its success.

897077_13_ITEM1_P67_S0	The Company s sales, both product and replacement parts, are generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year, because a substantial number of the Company s products are used for maintenance activities such as vegetation maintenance, highway right-of-way maintenance, construction, and street and parking lot sweeping.

897077_13_ITEM1_P69_S4	The Company believes that it is able to compete successfully in its markets by effectively managing its manufacturing costs, offering high quality products, developing and designing innovative products and, to some extent, avoiding direct competition with significantly larger potential competitors.
897077_13_ITEM1_P69_S5	There can be no assurance that the Company s competitors will not substantially increase the resources devoted to the development and marketing of products competitive with the Company s products or that new competitors with greater resources will not enter the Company s markets.

897077_13_ITEM1_P70_S1	The 4% increase was primarily due to the positive impact of improved agricultural market conditions on Bush Hog and Rhino backlogs during the fourth quarter of 2012.
897077_13_ITEM1_P71_S0	The Company continues to be affected by soft market conditions and reduced government spending in parts of its Industrial and European divisions.

897077_13_ITEM1_P72_S0	The amount of unfilled orders at a particular time is affected by a number of factors, including manufacturing and shipping schedules which, in most instances, are dependent on the Company s seasonal sales programs and the requirements of its customers.
897077_13_ITEM1_P72_S1	Certain of the Company s orders are subject to cancellation at any time before shipment; therefore, a comparison of unfilled orders from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of future actual shipments.

897077_13_ITEM1_P75_S1	In addition, the Company, through its subsidiaries, purchases tractors and truck chassis as a number of the Company s products are mounted and shipped with a tractor or truck chassis.
897077_13_ITEM1_P75_S2	Tractors and truck chassis are generally available, but some delays in receiving tractors or truck chassis can occur throughout the year.

897077_13_ITEM1_P82_S2	The Company voluntarily worked with an environmental consultant and the state of Iowa with respect to these issues and believes it completed its remediation program in June 2006.

897077_13_ITEM1_P83_S1	The reserve was for potential ground water contamination/remediation that was identified before the acquisition and believed to have been generated by a third party company located near the Gradall facility.
897077_13_ITEM1_P83_S2	Monitoring of the test wells by the City of New Philadelphia as required by the Ohio EPA has shown no increase in contamination over the past 30 years and the Company was informed in the fourth quarter of 2012 that the wells were plugged during the second half of the year.

897077_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales to federal, state and local governmental entities both in the U.S. and in other countries in which we sell our products.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	These sales depend primarily on the levels of budgeted and appropriated expenditures for highway, airport, roadside and parks maintenance by various governmental entities and are affected by changes in local and national economic conditions.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our dependence on, and the price and availability of, raw materials as well as purchased components may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We are subject to fluctuations in market prices for raw materials such as steel and energy.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Additionally, although most of the raw materials and purchase components we use are commercially available from a number of sources, we could experience disruptions in the availability of such materials.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P11_S2	If we are unable to purchase materials we require or are unable to pass on price increases to our customers or otherwise reduce our cost of goods sold, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P11_S3	In addition, higher energy costs may negatively affect spending by farmers, including their purchases of our products.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	This analysis requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	The cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of time, which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to an even higher degree of uncertainty.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P13_S3	The Company also utilizes market valuation models and other financial ratios, which require the Company to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to its assets and businesses.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , goodwill was $ 31,648,000 , which represents 8% of total assets.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The Company recognized goodwill impairment at one of its French operations, Faucheux, of $ 656,000 in 2012 and two of its French operations, SMA and Rousseau, of $1,898,000 in 2011 and no goodwill impairment in 2010.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The primary reason for the goodwill impairment in 2012 and 2011 was the general economic downturn that continues to affect the Company's European operations.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P15_S2	This caused the Company to revise its expectations about future revenue, which is a significant factor in the discounted cash flow analysis used to estimate the fair value of the Company's reporting units.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P15_S3	During the 2012 impairment analysis review, i t was noted that even though the Schwarze and Rivard reporting unit's fair value was above carrying value, it was not materially different.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P15_S4	On December 31, 2012 , there was approximately $6.8 million and $11.8 million of goodwill related to the Schwarze and Rivard reporting units, respectively.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P15_S5	These reporting units would be most likely affected by changes in the Company s assumptions and estimates.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P15_S6	The calculation of fair value could increase or decrease depending on changes in the inputs and assumptions used, such as changes in the reporting unit s future growth rates, discount rates, etc.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We operate in a highly competitive industry, and some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater resources than we do.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our products are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	We compete with several large national and international companies that offer a broad range of equipment and replacement parts that compete with our products, as well as with numerous small, privately-held manufacturers and suppliers of a limited number of products mainly on a regional basis.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Some of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater financial and other resources at their disposal.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P17_S3	We believe that we are able to compete successfully in our markets by, to some extent, avoiding direct competition with significantly larger potential competitors.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P17_S4	There can be no assurance that our competitors will not substantially increase the resources devoted to the development and marketing of products competitive with our products or that new competitors with greater resources will not enter our markets.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Any failure to effectively compete could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We operate and source internationally, which exposes us to the political, economic and other risks of doing business abroad.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We have operations in a number of countries outside of the United States and we source raw materials and components globally.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Our international operations are subject to the risks normally associated with conducting business in foreign countries, including but not limited to the following:
897077_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the United States and the other countries in which we operate affecting foreign trade, investment and taxation.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	In addition, political developments and governmental regulations and policies in the countries in which we operate directly affect the demand for our products.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	For example, decreases or delays in farm subsidies to our agricultural customers, or changes in environmental policies aimed at limiting mowing activities, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our acquisition strategy may not be successful, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We intend to grow internally and through the acquisition of businesses and assets that will complement our current businesses.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	To date, a material portion of our growth has come through acquisitions.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P23_S2	We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition targets, obtain financing for acquisitions on satisfactory terms or successfully acquire identified targets.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Competition for acquisition opportunities may also increase our costs of making acquisitions or prevent us from making certain acquisitions.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P23_S4	These and other acquisition-related factors may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We may be unable to complete or integrate existing or future acquisitions effectively, and businesses we have acquired, or may acquire in the future, may not perform as expected.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We may not be successful in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations and achieving projected synergies.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	We could face many risks in integrating acquired businesses, including but not limited to the following:
897077_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	we may encounter unanticipated events, circumstances or legal liabilities.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts from the management of each entity, including coordinating existing business plans and research and development efforts.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Integrating operations may distract management s attention from the day-to-day operation of the combined companies.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Ultimately, our attempts to integrate the operations, technology and personnel of acquired businesses may not be successful.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P27_S3	If we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses, our future results may be negatively impacted.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	In addition, we may be adversely affected if businesses that we have acquired, or that we acquire in the future, do not perform as expected.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P28_S1	An acquired business could perform below our expectations for a number of reasons, including legislative or regulatory changes that affect the areas in which the acquired business specializes, the loss of customers and dealers, general economic factors that directly affect the acquired business, and the cultural incompatibility of its management team.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Any or all of these reasons could adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The agricultural industry and the mowing and right of way maintenance industry are seasonal and are affected by the weather, and seasonal fluctuations may cause our results of operations and working capital to fluctuate from quarter to quarter.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	In general, agricultural and governmental end-users typically purchase new equipment during the first and second calendar quarters.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Other products such as street sweepers, excavators, snow blowers, front-end loaders and pothole patchers have different seasonal patterns, as do replacement parts in general.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P30_S2	In attempting to achieve efficient utilization of manpower and facilities throughout the year, we estimate seasonal demand months in advance and manufacturing capacity is scheduled in anticipation of such demand.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P30_S3	We utilize a rolling twelve-month sales forecast provided by our marketing divisions and order backlog in order to develop a production plan for our manufacturing facilities.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Additionally, many of our marketing departments attempt to equalize demand for their products throughout the calendar year by offering seasonal sales programs which may provide additional incentives, including discounts and extended payment terms, on equipment that is ordered during off-season periods.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P30_S5	Because we spread our production and wholesale shipments throughout the year to take into account the factors described above, sales in any given period may not reflect the timing of dealer orders and retail demand.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Weather conditions and general economic conditions may affect the timing of purchases and actual industry conditions might differ from our forecasts.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Consequently, sudden or significant declines in industry demand could adversely affect our working capital or results of operations.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	If we do not retain key personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees, our business may suffer.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our continued success will depend on, among other things, the efforts and skills of our executive officers, including our president and chief executive officer, and our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified managerial, technical, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We do not maintain key man life insurance for any of our employees, and all of our senior management are employed at will.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P33_S2	We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and hire suitable replacements for any of our key employees.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P33_S3	We believe the loss of a key executive officer or other key employee could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We are subject on an ongoing basis to the risk of product liability claims and other litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Like other manufacturers, we are subject to various claims, including product liability claims, arising in the ordinary course of business, and we are a party to various legal proceedings that constitute routine litigation incidental to our business.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We may be exposed to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury, property damage, or both.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P35_S2	We cannot assure you that we will not experience any material product liability losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P35_S3	While we currently have product liability insurance, we cannot assure you that our product liability insurance coverage will be adequate for any liabilities that may ultimately be incurred or that it will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P35_S4	A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage or a requirement to participate in a product recall may have a materially adverse effect on our business.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We are subject to environmental, health and safety and employment laws and regulations and related compliance expenditures and liabilities.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Like other manufacturers, the Company is subject to a broad range of federal, state, local and foreign laws and requirements, including those concerning air emissions, discharges into waterways, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials, as well as the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances at the Company s facilities and offsite disposal locations, workplace safety and equal employment opportunities.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P37_S1	These laws and regulations are constantly changing, and it is impossible to predict with accuracy the effect that changes to such laws and regulations may have on the Company in the future.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Like other industrial concerns, the Company s manufacturing operations entail the risk of noncompliance, and there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur material costs or other liabilities as a result thereof.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The Company knows that its Indianola, Iowa property is contaminated with chromium which most likely resulted from chrome plating operations which were discontinued before the Company purchased the property.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Chlorinated volatile organic compounds have also been detected in water samples on the property, though the source is unknown at this time.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P39_S2	The Company voluntarily worked with an environmental consultant and the state of Iowa with respect to these issues and believes it completed its remediation program in June 2006.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P39_S3	The work was accomplished within the Company s environmental liability reserve balance.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P39_S4	We requested a no further action classification from the state.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P39_S5	We received a conditional no further action letter in January of 2009.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P39_S6	When we demonstrate stable or improving conditions below residential standards for a certain period of time by monitoring existing wells, an unconditional no further action letter will be requested which we may not receive.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The Company knows that Bush Hog s main manufacturing property in Selma, Alabama was contaminated with chlorinated volatile organic compounds which most likely resulted from painting and cleaning operations during the 1960s and 1970s.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P40_S1	The contaminated areas were primarily in the location of underground storage tanks and underneath the former waste storage area.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, Bush Hog s prior owner agreed to and has removed the underground storage tanks at its cost and has remediated the identified contamination in accordance with the regulations of the Alabama Department of Environmental Management.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P40_S3	An environmental consulting firm was retained by the prior owner to administer the cleanup and monitor the site on an ongoing basis until the remediation program is complete and approved by the applicable authorities.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Certain other properties of the Company contain asbestos that may have to be remediated over time and it could be additional expense to the Company.

897077_13_ITEM1A_P43_S0	If we are unable to comply with the terms of our credit arrangements, especially the financial covenants, our credit arrangements could be terminated.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all of the terms of our credit arrangements, especially the financial covenants.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Our ability to comply with such terms depends on the success of our business and our operating results.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Various risks, uncertainties, and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with the terms of our credit arrangements.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P44_S3	If we were out of compliance with any covenant required by our credit arrangements following any applicable cure periods, the banks could terminate their commitments unless we could negotiate a covenant waiver.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P44_S4	The banks could condition such waiver on amendments to the terms of our credit arrangements that may be unfavorable to us including, the interest rate we currently pay on outstanding debt under our credit arrangements could increase, which could adversely affect our operating results.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominantly in European countries, Canada and Australia, as a result of the sale of our products in international markets.

897077_13_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, such as a devaluation of the Euro against the U.S. dollar, could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations or financial condition.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Because the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and its trading volume has generally been low, it may be difficult for you to resell our common stock when desired or at attractive prices.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P49_S1	The closing prices of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange during 2012 ranged from $ 34.07 to $ 26.20 per share, and during 2011 from $ 29.14 to $ 20.11 per share.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Our stock price may fluctuate in response to the risk factors set forth herein and to a number of events and factors, such as quarterly variations in operating and financial results, litigation, changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts, the operating and stock performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us, news reports relating to us or trends in our industry or general economic conditions.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P49_S3	Furthermore, the trading volume of our common stock has generally been low, which may increase the volatility of the market price for our stock.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P49_S4	The stock price volatility and low trading volume may make it difficult for you to resell your shares of our common stock when desired or at attractive prices.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P50_S0	You may experience dilution of your ownership interests due to the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We may issue shares of our previously authorized and unissued securities which will result in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P51_S1	We are currently authorized to issue 20,000,000 shares of common stock.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P51_S2	On December 31, 2012 , 12,036,979 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding, and there were outstanding options and restricted stock awards totaling an additional 431,805 shares of our common stock.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P51_S3	We also have additional shares available for grant under our 2005 Incentive Stock Option Plan and our 2009 Equity Incentive Plan.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P51_S4	Additional stock option or other compensation plans or amendments to existing plans for employees and directors may be adopted.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P51_S5	Issuance of these shares of common stock may dilute the ownership interests of our then existing stockholders.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P51_S6	We may also issue additional shares of our common stock in connection with the hiring of personnel, future acquisitions, such as the 1,700,000 shares issued as consideration for the acquisition of Bush Hog in 2009, future private placements of our securities for capital raising purposes or for other business purposes.

897077_13_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Future sales, or the availability for sale in the public market, of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities.
897077_13_ITEM1A_P58_S1	If we or our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or if there is a perception that these sales may occur, the market price of our common stock could decline.

897077_13_ITEM1A_P60_S1	As a result, either Capital Southwest or the other major stockholders combined could be able to significantly influence the direction of the Company, the election of our Board of Directors and the outcome of any other matter requiring stockholder approval, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and together with other beneficially owned investors, to prevent or cause a change in control of the Company.

897077_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	The revolving credit agreement requires us to maintain various financial covenants including a minimum EBIT to interest expense ratio, a minimum leverage ratio and a minimum asset coverage ratio.
897077_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	The agreement also contains various covenants relating to limitations on indebtedness, limitations on investments and acquisitions, limitations on sale of properties and limitations on liens and capital expenditures.
897077_13_ITEM7_P32_S2	The revolving credit agreement also contains other customary covenants, representations and events of defaults.
897077_13_ITEM7_P32_S3	As of December 31, 2012 , the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the revolving credit facility.
897077_13_ITEM7_P32_S4	The termination date of the revolving credit facility is March 28, 2016.
897077_13_ITEM7_P32_S5	As of December 31, 2012 , no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
897077_13_ITEM7_P32_S6	On December 31, 2012 , $1,335,000 of the revolver capacity was committed to irrevocable standby letters of credit issued in the ordinary course of business as required by vendors' contracts resulting in $98,665,000 in available borrowings.
897077_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	Alamo Group Europe Limited renewed its facility with Lloyd s TSB Bank plc..
897077_13_ITEM7_P33_S1	The facility was renewed effective November 12, 2012 and any outstanding balance would bear interest at Lloyd s Base Rate plus 2.0% per annum.
897077_13_ITEM7_P33_S2	The facility is unsecured but guaranteed by the U.K. subsidiaries of Alamo Group Europe Limited.
897077_13_ITEM7_P33_S3	As of December 31, 2012 , there were no outstanding balances in British pounds borrowed against the U.K. overdraft facility.
897077_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	There are additional lines of credit: for the Company s French operations in the amount of 6,200,000 Euros, for our Canadian operation in the amount of 3,500,000 Canadian dollars; and for our Australian operation in the amount of 400,000 Australian dollars.

897077_13_ITEM7_P34_S2	The Canadian and Australian revolving credit facilities are guaranteed by the Company.
897077_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , the Company is in compliance with the terms and conditions of its credit facilities.
897077_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	Management believes the bank credit facilities and the Company s ability to internally generate funds from operations should be sufficient to meet the Company s cash requirements for the foreseeable future.
897077_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	However, challenges affecting the banking industry and credit markets in general can potentially cause changes to credit availability which creates a level of uncertainty.
897077_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	The Company believes that inflation generally has not had a material impact on its operations or liquidity.
897077_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	The Company is exposed to the risk that the price of energy, steel and other purchased components may increase and the Company may not be able to increase the price of its products correspondingly.
897077_13_ITEM7_P37_S2	If this occurs, the Company s results of operations would be adversely impacted.
897077_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the ATR Act ) which included an extension of the federal research and development credit retroactively to 2012 and prospectively through 2013.
897077_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	The effects of the ATR Act are recognized in 2013.
897077_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	No. 2011-11, Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities .
897077_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	ASU 2011-11 will require the Company to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position.
897077_13_ITEM7_P39_S2	The new guidance is effective for the Company's interim period ending March 31, 2013.
897077_13_ITEM7_P39_S3	The disclosures required are to be applied retrospectively for all comparative periods presented.
897077_13_ITEM7_P39_S4	The Company does not expect that this guidance will have an impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows as it is disclosure-only in nature.
897077_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	The SEC adopted the conflict mineral rules under Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act on August 22, 2012.
897077_13_ITEM7_P40_S1	The rules require public companies to disclose information about their use of specific minerals originating from and financing armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries.
897077_13_ITEM7_P40_S2	The conflict mineral rules cover minerals frequently used to manufacture a wide array of electronic and industrial products including semiconductor devices.
897077_13_ITEM7_P40_S3	The rules do not ban the use of minerals from conflict sources, but require public disclosure beginning with calendar year 2013.
897077_13_ITEM7_P40_S4	We have determined that we are subject to the rules and are evaluating our supply chain and continue to develop processes to assess the impacts and comply with the regulation.
897077_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	In July 2012, the FASB amended its guidance to simplify how an entity tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.
897077_13_ITEM7_P41_S1	The amendment will allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative impairment test.
897077_13_ITEM7_P41_S2	An entity no longer will be required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount.
897077_13_ITEM7_P41_S3	The amendment becomes effective for the Company's interim period ending March 31, 2013 and early adoption is permitted.
897077_13_ITEM7_P41_S4	We have elected to adopt this guidance for the year ended December 31, 2012 and this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
897077_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	The Company does not have any obligation, under any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the Company is a party, that has or is reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
897077_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	The following table shows the Company s approximate obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012 :
897077_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	Definitions: (A) Long-term debt obligation means a principal payment obligation under long-term borrowings.
897077_13_ITEM7_P44_S1	(B) Capital lease obligation means a principal payment obligation under a lease classified as a capital lease.
897077_13_ITEM7_P44_S2	(C) Interest obligation represents interest due on long-term debt and capital lease obligations.
897077_13_ITEM7_P44_S3	Interest on long-term debt assumes all floating rates of interest remain the same as those in effect at December 31, 2012 .
897077_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	(D) Operating lease obligation means a payment obligation under a lease classified as an operating lease.
897077_13_ITEM7_P45_S1	(E) Purchase obligation means an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the registrant that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions.
897077_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	Critical Accounting Estimates Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ).
897077_13_ITEM7_P46_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
897077_13_ITEM7_P46_S2	Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
897077_13_ITEM7_P46_S3	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
897077_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the financial statements.
897077_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
897077_13_ITEM7_P47_S2	For further information on the critical accounting policies, see Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
897077_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	The Company evaluates the collectability of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors.
897077_13_ITEM7_P48_S1	In circumstances where it is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations, the Company records a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what it believes will be collected.
897077_13_ITEM7_P48_S2	For all other customers, it recognizes reserves for bad debt based on historical experience of bad debts as a percent of revenues for each business unit, adjusted for relative improvements or deteriorations in the aging and changes in current economic conditions.
897077_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	The Company evaluates all receivables that are over 60 days old and will reserve specifically on a 90-day basis.
897077_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	The Company has a secured or insured interest on most of its wholegoods that each customer purchases.
897077_13_ITEM7_P50_S1	This allows the Company, in times of a difficult economy when the customer is unable to pay or has filed for bankruptcy, to repossess its inventory.
897077_13_ITEM7_P50_S2	This also allows Alamo Group to maintain only a reserve over its cost, which usually represents the margin on the original sales price.
897077_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $ 3,077,000 on December 31, 2012 , and $ 3,215,000 on December 31, 2011 .
897077_13_ITEM7_P51_S1	The decrease was mainly from the Company s Agricultural Division.
897077_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	On December 31, 2012 , the Company had $ 15,005,000 in reserves for sales discounts compared to $ 14,567,000 on December 31, 2011 on product shipped to our customers under various promotional programs.
897077_13_ITEM7_P52_S1	The increase was due primarily to increased sales volume of the Company s agricultural products during the 2012 pre-season, which runs during the third and fourth quarters of each year with orders shipped through the second quarter of 2013.
897077_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	The Company reviews the reserve quarterly based on analysis made on each program outstanding at the time.
897077_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	The Company bases its reserves on historical data relating to discounts taken by the customer under each program.
897077_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	Historically, between 85% and 95% of the Company s customers who qualify for each program actually take the discount that is available.
897077_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	The Company had a reserve of $ 9,099,000 on December 31, 2012 and $ 7,630,000 on December 31, 2011 to cover obsolete and slow moving inventory.
897077_13_ITEM7_P55_S1	The increase in the reserve was mainly from the U.S. Agricultural Division and the European Division, specifically its French operations.
897077_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	The obsolete and slow moving inventory policy states that the reserve is to be calculated as follows: 1) no inventory usage over a three-year period is deemed obsolete and reserved at 100 percent; and 2) slow moving inventory with little usage requires a 100 percent reserve on items that have a quantity greater than a three-year supply.
897077_13_ITEM7_P56_S1	There are exceptions to the obsolete and slow moving classifications if approved by an officer of the Company, based on specific identification of an item or items that are deemed to be either included or excluded from this classification.
897077_13_ITEM7_P56_S2	In cases where there is no historical data, management makes a judgment based on a specific review of the inventory in question to determine what reserves, if any, are appropriate.
897077_13_ITEM7_P56_S3	New products or parts are generally excluded from the reserve policy until a three-year history has been established.
897077_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	The reserve is reviewed and, if necessary, adjustments are made on a quarterly basis.
897077_13_ITEM7_P57_S1	The Company relies on historical information when available to support its reserve.
897077_13_ITEM7_P57_S2	The Company does not adjust the reserve balance until the inventory is liquidated.
897077_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	The Company s warranty policy is generally to provide its customers warranty for up to one year on all wholegood units and 90 days on parts though some components can have warranty for longer terms.
897077_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	Warranty reserve, as a percentage of sales, is generally calculated by looking at the current twelve months expenses and prorating that amount based on twelve months sales with a ninety-day to six-month lag period.
897077_13_ITEM7_P59_S1	The Company s historical experience is that an end-user takes approximately 90 days to six months from the receipt of the unit to file a warranty claim.
897077_13_ITEM7_P59_S2	A warranty reserve is established for each different marketing group.
897077_13_ITEM7_P59_S3	Reserve balances are evaluated on a quarterly basis and adjustments made when required.
897077_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	The current liability warranty reserve balance was $ 5,007,000 on December 31, 2012 and $ 5,083,000 on December 31, 2011 .
897077_13_ITEM7_P60_S1	The decrease was mainly from the Company s Industrial Division.
897077_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	We test goodwill for impairment annually, at the reporting unit level, and whenever events or circumstances make it likely that an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell all or a portion of a reporting unit.
897077_13_ITEM7_P61_S1	We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis.
897077_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	Goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing a qualitative assessment or a two-step process.
897077_13_ITEM7_P62_S1	We have an option to make a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit's goodwill for impairment.
897077_13_ITEM7_P62_S2	If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary.
897077_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	For reporting units where we perform the two-step process, the first step requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill.
897077_13_ITEM7_P63_S1	If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not considered impaired.
897077_13_ITEM7_P63_S2	If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, there is an indication that an impairment may exist and the second step is required.
897077_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	In step two, the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities.
897077_13_ITEM7_P64_S1	If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill, the difference is recognized as an impairment loss.
897077_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis.
897077_13_ITEM7_P65_S1	This analysis requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates.
897077_13_ITEM7_P65_S2	The cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of time, which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to an even higher degree of uncertainty.
897077_13_ITEM7_P65_S3	The Company also utilizes market valuation models and other financial ratios, which require the Company to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to its assets and businesses.
897077_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , goodwill was $ 31,648,000 , which represents 8% of total assets.
897077_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	The Company recognized goodwill impairment at one of its French operations, Faucheux of $ 656,000 in 2012 and at two of its French operations, SMA and Rousseau of $1,898,000 in 2011 and no goodwill impairment in 2010.
897077_13_ITEM7_P67_S1	The primary reason for the goodwill impairment in 2012 and 2011 was the general economic downturn that continues to affect the Company's European operations.
897077_13_ITEM7_P67_S2	This caused the Company to revise its expectations about future revenue, which is a significant factor in the discounted cash flow analysis used to estimate the fair value of the Company's reporting units.
897077_13_ITEM7_P67_S3	During the 2012 impairment analysis review, it was noted that even though the Schwarze and Rivard reporting unit's fair value was above carrying value, it was not materially different.
897077_13_ITEM7_P67_S4	On December 31, 2012 , there was approximately $6.8 million and $11.8 million of goodwill related to the Schwarze and Rivard reporting units, respectively.
897077_13_ITEM7_P67_S5	These reporting units would be most likely affected by changes in the Company s assumptions and estimates.
897077_13_ITEM7_P67_S6	The calculation of fair value could increase or decrease depending on changes in the inputs and assumptions used, such as changes in the reporting unit s future growth rates, discount rates, etc.
897077_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	Management believes that the estimated valuations it arrived at are reasonable and consistent with what other marketplace participants would use in valuing the Company's components.
897077_13_ITEM7_P68_S1	However, management cannot give any assurance that these market values will not change in the future.
897077_13_ITEM7_P68_S2	For example, if discount rates demanded by the market increase, this could lead to reduced valuations under the income approach.
897077_13_ITEM7_P68_S3	If the Company's projections are not achieved in the future, this could lead management to reassess their assumptions and lead to reduced valuations under the income approach.
897077_13_ITEM7_P68_S4	If the market price of the Company's stock decreases, this could cause the Company to reassess the reasonableness of the implied control premium, which might cause management to assume a higher discount rate under the income approach which could lead to reduced valuations.
897077_13_ITEM7_P68_S5	If future similar transactions exhibit lower multiples than those observed in the past, this could lead to reduced valuations under the similar transactions approach.
897077_13_ITEM7_P68_S6	And finally, if there is a general decline in the stock market and particularly in those companies selected as comparable to the Company's components, this could lead to reduced valuations under the public company market multiple approach.
897077_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	The Company's annual impairment test is performed during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.
897077_13_ITEM7_P69_S1	Given the current market conditions and continued economic uncertainty, the fair value of the Company's components could deteriorate which could result in the need to record impairment charges in future periods.
897077_13_ITEM7_P69_S2	The Company also monitors potential triggering events including changes in the business climate in which it operates, attrition of key personnel, volatility in the capital markets, the Company's market capitalization compared to its book value, the Company's recent operating performance, and the Company's financial projections.
897077_13_ITEM7_P69_S3	The occurrence of one or more triggering events could require additional impairment testing, which could result in future impairment charges.
897077_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	value is not materially different from fair value, any changes to the Company's assumptions could lead to an indicated impairment in step one, requiring the Company to proceed to step two and potentially record an impairment charge.
897077_13_ITEM7_P70_S1	See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding goodwill.
897077_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The Company is exposed to various financial market risks.
897077_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates.
897077_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The Company does not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
897077_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	A portion of the Company s operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities in international jurisdictions.
897077_13_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The Company primarily manufactures its products in the United States, the U.K., France, Canada and Australia.
897077_13_ITEM7A_P2_S2	The Company sells its products primarily within the markets where the products are produced, but certain of the Company s sales from its U.K. operations are denominated in other European currencies.
897077_13_ITEM7A_P2_S3	As a result, the Company s financials, specifically the value of its foreign assets, could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the other markets in which the subsidiaries of the Company distribute their products.
897077_13_ITEM7A_P3_S0	To mitigate the short-term effect of changes in currency exchange rates on the Company s functional currency-based sales, the Company s U.K. subsidiaries regularly enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge over 90% of its future net foreign currency cash receipts over a period of six months.
897077_13_ITEM7A_P3_S1	As of December 31, 2012 , the Company had $ 2,409,000 outstanding in forward exchange contracts related to accounts receivable.
897077_13_ITEM7A_P3_S2	A 15% fluctuation in exchange rates for these currencies would change the fair value by approximately $ 361,000 .
897077_13_ITEM7A_P3_S3	However, since these contracts hedge foreign currency denominated transactions, any change in the fair value of the contracts should be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged.
897077_13_ITEM7A_P4_S0	On December 31, 2012 , the fair value of these agreements was in an unfavorable position; therefore, the derivative financial instruments were recorded as a loss of $142,000 , which has been recognized in other income (expense), net.
897077_13_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The Company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominantly in European countries, Canada and Australia, as a result of the sale of its products in international markets.
897077_13_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Foreign currency forward contracts in the U.K. are used to hedge against the earnings effects of such fluctuations.
897077_13_ITEM7A_P5_S2	On December 31, 2012 , the result of a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies in which the Company s sales are denominated would have resulted in a decrease in gross profit of $ 5,275,000 .
897077_13_ITEM7A_P5_S3	Comparatively, on December 31, 2011 , the result of a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which the Company s sales are denominated would have resulted in a decrease in gross profit of approximately $ 4,816,000 .
897077_13_ITEM7A_P6_S0	This calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar.
897077_13_ITEM7A_P6_S1	In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, which are a changed dollar value of the resulting sales, changes in exchange rates may also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive.
897077_13_ITEM7A_P6_S2	The Company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices.
897077_13_ITEM7A_P6_S3	The translation adjustment during 2012 was a loss of $ 4,445,000 .
897077_13_ITEM7A_P7_S0	On December 31, 2012 , the British pound closed at 0.6155 relative to the U.S. dollar, and the Euro closed at 0.7579 relative to the U.S. dollar.
897077_13_ITEM7A_P7_S1	By comparison, on December 31, 2011 , the British pound closed at 0.6434 relative to the U.S. dollar, and the Euro closed at 0.7716 relative to the U.S. dollar.
897077_13_ITEM7A_P7_S2	No assurance can be given as to future valuation of the British pound or Euro or how further movements in those or other currencies could affect future earnings or the financial position of the Company.
897077_13_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Interest Rate Risk The majority of the Company s long-term debt bears interest at variable rates.
897077_13_ITEM7A_P8_S1	Accordingly, the Company s net income is affected by changes in interest rates.
897077_13_ITEM7A_P8_S2	Assuming the average level of borrowings at variable rates and a two hundred basis point change in the 2012 average interest rate under these borrowings, the Company s 2012 interest expense would have changed by approximately $ 520,000 .
897077_13_ITEM7A_P9_S0	In the event of an adverse change in interest rates, management could take actions to mitigate its exposure.
897077_13_ITEM7A_P9_S1	Further, this analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment.
897077_13_ITEM7A_P9_S2	However, challenges affecting the banking industry and credit markets in general can potentially cause changes to credit availability which creates a level of uncertainty.

897077_13_ITEM15_P12_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
897077_13_ITEM15_P12_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

897077_13_ITEM15_P24_S3	The reclassification of revenue and cost of sales for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 resulted in an increase of approximately $15.3 million , $15.6 million and $14.0 million , respectively, with no impact on reported net income.

897077_13_ITEM15_P30_S1	The credit risk is limited because of the large numbers and types of customers and their geographic dispersion.

897077_13_ITEM15_P33_S0	Depreciation is provided at amounts calculated to amortize the cost of the assets over their estimated useful economic lives using the straight-line method.
897077_13_ITEM15_P34_S0	Goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of businesses acquired.
897077_13_ITEM15_P34_S1	We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis.
897077_13_ITEM15_P35_S0	Goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing a qualitative assessment or a two-step process.
897077_13_ITEM15_P35_S1	We have an option to make a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit's goodwill for impairment.
897077_13_ITEM15_P35_S2	If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary.
897077_13_ITEM15_P36_S0	For reporting units where we perform the two-step process, the first step requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill.
897077_13_ITEM15_P36_S1	If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not considered impaired.
897077_13_ITEM15_P36_S2	If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, there is an indication that an impairment may exist and the second step is required.
897077_13_ITEM15_P37_S0	In step two, the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities.
897077_13_ITEM15_P37_S1	If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill, the difference is recognized as an impairment loss.
897077_13_ITEM15_P38_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis.
897077_13_ITEM15_P38_S1	This analysis requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates.
897077_13_ITEM15_P38_S2	The cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of time, which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to an even higher degree of uncertainty.
897077_13_ITEM15_P38_S3	The Company also utilizes market valuation models and other financial ratios, which require the Company to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to its assets and businesses.
897077_13_ITEM15_P39_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , goodwill was $ 31,648,000 , which represents 8% of total assets.
897077_13_ITEM15_P40_S0	The Company recognized goodwill impairment at one of its French operations, Faucheux of $ 656,000 in 2012 and two of its French operations, SMA and Rousseau of $1,898,000 in 2011 and no goodwill impairment in 2010.
897077_13_ITEM15_P40_S1	The primary reason for the goodwill impairment in 2012 and 2011 was the general economic downturn that continues to affect the Company's European operations.
897077_13_ITEM15_P40_S2	This caused the Company to revise its expectations about future revenue, which is a significant factor in the discounted cash flow analysis used to estimate the fair value of the Company's reporting units.
897077_13_ITEM15_P40_S3	During the 2012 impairment analysis review, it was noted that even though the Schwarze and Rivard reporting unit's fair value was above carrying value, it was not materially different.
897077_13_ITEM15_P40_S4	On December 31, 2012 , there was approximately $6.8 million and $11.8 million of goodwill related to the Schwarz e and Rivard reporting units, respectively.
897077_13_ITEM15_P40_S5	These reporting units would be most likely affected by changes in the Company s assumptions and estimates.
897077_13_ITEM15_P40_S6	The calculation of fair value could increase or decrease depending on changes in the inputs and assumptions used, such as changes in the reporting unit s future growth rates, discount rates, etc.
897077_13_ITEM15_P41_S0	Management believes that the estimated valuations it arrived at are reasonable and consistent with what other marketplace participants would use in valuing the Company's components.
897077_13_ITEM15_P41_S1	However, management cannot give any assurance that these market values will not change in the future.
897077_13_ITEM15_P42_S0	market increase, this could lead to reduced valuations under the income approach.
897077_13_ITEM15_P42_S1	If the Company's projections are not achieved in the future, this could lead management to reassess their assumptions and lead to reduced valuations under the income approach.
897077_13_ITEM15_P42_S2	If the market price of the Company's stock decreases, this could cause the Company to reassess the reasonableness of the implied control premium, which might cause management to assume a higher discount rate under the income approach which could lead to reduced valuations.
897077_13_ITEM15_P42_S3	If future similar transactions exhibit lower multiples than those observed in the past, this could lead to reduced valuations under the similar transactions approach.
897077_13_ITEM15_P42_S4	And finally, if there is a general decline in the stock market and particularly in those companies selected as comparable to the Company's components, this could lead to reduced valuations under the public company market multiple approach.
897077_13_ITEM15_P43_S0	The Company's annual impairment test is performed during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.
897077_13_ITEM15_P43_S1	Given the current market conditions and continued economic uncertainty, the fair value of the Company's components could deteriorate which could result in the need to record impairment charges in future periods.
897077_13_ITEM15_P43_S2	The Company also monitors potential triggering events including changes in the business climate in which it operates, attrition of key personnel, volatility in the capital markets, the Company's market capitalization compared to its book value, the Company's recent operating performance, and the Company's financial projections.
897077_13_ITEM15_P43_S3	The occurrence of one or more triggering events could require additional impairment testing, which could result in future impairment charges.
897077_13_ITEM15_P43_S4	In particular, since the Schwarze and Rivard , reporting unit's carrying value is not materially different from fair value, any changes to the Company's assumptions could lead to an indicated impairment in step one, requiring the Company to proceed to step two and potentially record an impairment charge.
897077_13_ITEM15_P44_S0	See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding goodwill.
897077_13_ITEM15_P45_S0	The Company s definite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names.
897077_13_ITEM15_P45_S1	The net book value of the trademarks was $ 5,500,000 as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 .
897077_13_ITEM15_P46_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company wrote off $224,000 in older patents which the Company believes no longer provide a competitive advantage.
897077_13_ITEM15_P47_S0	Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives not subject to amortization consist of the Gradall trade name valued at $3,600,000 and the Bush Hog trade name valued at $1,900,000 on December 31, 2012 .
897077_13_ITEM15_P48_S0	The Company tests its indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis at year-end, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset could be below its carrying amount.
897077_13_ITEM15_P48_S1	The impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, determined using the relief from royalty method, with its carrying amount.

897077_13_ITEM15_P58_S0	Revenue from sales is recorded net of a provision for discounts that are anticipated to be earned and deducted at time of payment by the customer.
897077_13_ITEM15_P58_S1	These approximated discounts represent an average of historical amounts taken and are adjusted as program terms are changed.
897077_13_ITEM15_P58_S2	The reserves for discounts are reviewed and adjusted quarterly.
897077_13_ITEM15_P58_S3	From time to time, revenue is recognized under a bill and hold arrangement.
897077_13_ITEM15_P58_S4	Revenue recognized under bill and hold arrangements for 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 was immaterial.

897077_13_ITEM15_P66_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to the future years in which deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized.
897077_13_ITEM15_P67_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.
897077_13_ITEM15_P67_S1	The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.
897077_13_ITEM15_P67_S2	Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.
897077_13_ITEM15_P67_S3	Based upon projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences.

897077_13_ITEM15_P69_S1	These options are granted for a term not exceeding ten years and are forfeited in the event the employee or director terminates his or her employment or relationship with the Company or one of its affiliates other than by retirement or death.
897077_13_ITEM15_P69_S2	These options generally vest over five years.
897077_13_ITEM15_P70_S0	All option plans contain anti-dilutive provisions that permit an adjustment of the number of shares of the Company s common stock represented by each option for any change in capitalization.
897077_13_ITEM15_P71_S0	The Company calculated the fair value for options with the following weighted-average assumptions for 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 :
897077_13_ITEM15_P72_S0	The carrying values of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivables, accounts payable, and accrued expenses, approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these items.
897077_13_ITEM15_P72_S1	The carrying value of our debt approximates the fair value as of December 31, 2012 and 2011.

897077_13_ITEM15_P75_S0	3. VALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS Valuation and qualifying accounts included the following:
897077_13_ITEM15_P76_S0	The Company evaluates the collectability of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors.
897077_13_ITEM15_P76_S1	In circumstances where it is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations, the Company records a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what it believes will be collected.
897077_13_ITEM15_P76_S2	For all other customers, it recognizes reserves for bad debt based on historical experience of bad debts as a percent of revenues for each business unit, adjusted for relative improvements or deteriorations in the aging and changes in current economic conditions.
897077_13_ITEM15_P77_S0	The Company evaluates all receivables that are over 60 days old and will reserve specifically on a 90 -day basis.
897077_13_ITEM15_P78_S0	The Company has a secured or insured interest on most of its wholegoods that each customer purchases.
897077_13_ITEM15_P78_S1	This allows the Company, in times of a difficult economy when the customer is unable to pay or has filed for bankruptcy, to repossess its inventory.
897077_13_ITEM15_P78_S2	This also allows Alamo Group to maintain only a reserve over its cost, which usually represents the margin on the original sales price.
897077_13_ITEM15_P79_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $ 3,077,000 on December 31, 2012 , and $ 3,215,000 on December 31, 2011 .
897077_13_ITEM15_P79_S1	The decrease was mainly from the Company s Agricultural Division.
897077_13_ITEM15_P80_S0	On December 31, 2012 , the Company had $ 15,005,000 in reserves for sales discounts compared to $ 14,567,000 on December 31, 2011 on product shipped to our customers under various promotional programs.
897077_13_ITEM15_P80_S1	The increase was due primarily to increased sales volume of the Company s agricultural products during the pre-season, which runs during the third and fourth quarters of each year with orders shipped through the second quarter of 2013.
897077_13_ITEM15_P81_S0	The Company reviews the reserve quarterly based on analysis made on each program outstanding at the time.
897077_13_ITEM15_P82_S0	The Company bases its reserves on historical data relating to discounts taken by the customer under each program.
897077_13_ITEM15_P82_S1	Historically, between 85% and 95% of the Company s customers who qualify for each program actually take the discount that is available.
897077_13_ITEM15_P83_S0	The Company had a reserve of $ 9,099,000 on December 31, 2012 and $ 7,630,000 on December 31, 2011 to cover obsolete and slow moving inventory.
897077_13_ITEM15_P83_S1	The increase in the reserve was mainly from the U.S. Agricultural Division and the European Division, specifically its French operations.
897077_13_ITEM15_P84_S0	The obsolete and slow moving inventory policy states that the reserve is to be calculated as follows: 1) no inventory usage over a three -year period is deemed obsolete and reserved at 100 percent ; and 2) slow moving inventory with little usage requires a 100 percent reserve on items that have a quantity greater than a three -year supply.
897077_13_ITEM15_P84_S1	There are exceptions to the obsolete and slow moving classifications if approved by an officer of the Company, based on specific identification of an item or items that are deemed to be either included or excluded from this classification.
897077_13_ITEM15_P84_S2	In cases where there is no historical data, management makes a judgment based on a specific review of the inventory in question to determine what reserves, if any, are appropriate.
897077_13_ITEM15_P84_S3	New products or parts are generally excluded from the reserve policy until a three -year history has been established.
897077_13_ITEM15_P85_S0	The Company s warranty policy is generally to provide its customers warranty for up to one year on all wholegood units and 90 days on parts though some components can have warranty for longer terms.
897077_13_ITEM15_P86_S0	Warranty reserve, as a percentage of sales, is generally calculated by looking at the current twelve months expenses and prorating that amount based on twelve months sales with a ninety -day to six -month lag period.
897077_13_ITEM15_P86_S1	The Company s historical experience is that an end-user takes approximately 90 days to six months from the receipt of the unit to file a warranty claim.
897077_13_ITEM15_P86_S2	A warranty reserve is established for each different marketing group.
897077_13_ITEM15_P86_S3	Reserve balances are evaluated on a quarterly basis and adjustments made when required.
897077_13_ITEM15_P87_S0	The current liability warranty reserve balance was $ 5,007,000 on December 31, 2012 and $ 5,083,000 on December 31, 2011 .
897077_13_ITEM15_P87_S1	The decrease was mainly from the Company s Industrial Division.
897077_13_ITEM15_P88_S0	Inventories valued at LIFO represented 56% and 61% of total inventory for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
897077_13_ITEM15_P88_S1	The excess of current costs over LIFO-valued inventories was $ 8,975,000 and $ 9,459,000 on December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 , respectively.
897077_13_ITEM15_P88_S2	(The $ 484,000 decrease in LIFO reserve during 2012 came from reductions in inventory levels within U.S. operations.
897077_13_ITEM15_P88_S3	Inventories consisted of the following on a cost basis, net of reserves:
897077_13_ITEM15_P89_S0	PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment consist of the following:

897077_13_ITEM15_P94_S0	The Company maintains a revolving credit facility with certain lenders under its Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement.
897077_13_ITEM15_P94_S1	The aggregate commitments from lenders under such revolving credit facility is $100,000,000 and, subject to certain conditions, the Company has the option to request an increase in aggregate commitments of up to an additional $50,000,000 .
897077_13_ITEM15_P95_S0	The revolving credit agreement requires us to maintain various financial covenants including a minimum EBIT to interest expense ratio, a minimum leverage ratio and a minimum asset coverage ratio.

897077_13_ITEM15_P100_S1	Since the Company s debt is not quoted, estimates are based on each obligation s characteristics, including remaining maturities, interest rate, credit rating, collateral, amortization schedule and liquidity.
897077_13_ITEM15_P100_S2	The carrying amount approximates fair value.
897077_13_ITEM15_P101_S0	DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING Most of the Company s outstanding debt is advanced from a revolving credit facility that accrues interest at a contractual margin over current market interest rates.
897077_13_ITEM15_P101_S1	The Company s financing costs associated with this credit facility can materially change with market increases and decreases of short-term borrowing rates, specifically London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ).
897077_13_ITEM15_P102_S0	During the second quarter of 2007, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements with JPMorgan that hedged future cash flows related to its outstanding debt obligations.

897077_13_ITEM15_P102_S3	At December 31, 2012 there was zero liability related to the expired interest rate swaps.
897077_13_ITEM15_P103_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
897077_13_ITEM15_P104_S0	There is a three-tier fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs used in valuation techniques.
897077_13_ITEM15_P104_S1	Observable inputs (highest level) reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs (lowest level) reflect internally developed market assumptions.
897077_13_ITEM15_P104_S2	In Fair value measurements are classified under the following hierarchy:
897077_13_ITEM15_P105_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
897077_13_ITEM15_P105_S1	Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs or significant value-drivers are observable in active markets.
897077_13_ITEM15_P106_S0	When available, the Company uses quoted market prices to determine fair value, and the Company classifies such measurements within Level 1.
897077_13_ITEM15_P106_S1	In some cases where market prices are not available, the Company makes use of observable market-based inputs to calculate fair value, in which case the measurements are classified with Level 2.
897077_13_ITEM15_P107_S0	If quoted or observable market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that use, where possible, current market-based parameters such as interest rates, yield curves, currency rates, etc.
897077_13_ITEM15_P107_S1	These measurements are classified within Level 3.
897077_13_ITEM15_P108_S0	Fair value measurements are classified to the lowest level input or value-driver that is significant to the valuation.
897077_13_ITEM15_P108_S1	A measurement may therefore be classified within Level 3 even though there may be significant inputs that are readily observable.
897077_13_ITEM15_P109_S0	The jurisdictional components of income before taxes consist of the following:
897077_13_ITEM15_P110_S0	The components of income tax expense (benefit) consist of the following:
897077_13_ITEM15_P111_S0	The difference between income tax expense (benefit) for financial statement purposes and the amount of income tax expense computed by applying the domestic statutory income tax rate of 35% to income loss before income taxes consist of the following:
897077_13_ITEM15_P112_S0	Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis.
897077_13_ITEM15_P112_S1	The components of the Company s deferred income tax assets and liabilities consist of the following:
897077_13_ITEM15_P113_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , the Company had foreign deferred tax assets consisting of foreign net operating losses and other tax benefits available to reduce future taxable income in a foreign jurisdiction.
897077_13_ITEM15_P113_S1	These foreign jurisdictions' net operating loss carryforwards are in the approximate amount of $10.6 million with an unlimited carryforward period.
897077_13_ITEM15_P113_S2	The Company also has U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards in the approximate amount of $3.5 million which expire from 2014 to 2028.
897077_13_ITEM15_P114_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
897077_13_ITEM15_P114_S1	Based on the expectation of future taxable income and that the deductible temporary differences will offset existing taxable temporary differences, the Company believes it is more likely than not that it will realize the benefits of these deductible differences.

897077_13_ITEM15_P148_S0	The Company employs a building block approach in determining the expected long-term rate on return on plan assets.
897077_13_ITEM15_P148_S1	Historical markets are studied and long-term historical relationships between equities and fixed income are preserved consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run.
897077_13_ITEM15_P148_S2	Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term market assumptions are determined.
897077_13_ITEM15_P148_S3	The long-term portfolio return is established via a building block approach with proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing.
897077_13_ITEM15_P148_S4	Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness.

897077_13_ITEM15_P152_S2	Other assets such as real estate, private equity, and hedge funds are used judiciously to enhance long-term returns while improving portfolio diversification.
897077_13_ITEM15_P152_S3	Derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely manner; however, derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of the underlying investments.
897077_13_ITEM15_P153_S0	Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements, and periodic asset/liability studies.
897077_13_ITEM15_P154_S0	The pension plans' weighted-average asset allocations as a percentage of plan assets at December 31 are as follows:
897077_13_ITEM15_P155_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , we used the following valuation techniques to measure fair value for assets.
897077_13_ITEM15_P155_S1	There were no changes to these methodologies during 2012 : Level 1 - Assets were valued using the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual security was traded.
897077_13_ITEM15_P155_S2	Level 2 - Assets were valued using quoted prices in markets that are not active, broker dealer quotations, net asset value of shares held by the plans, and other methods by which all significant input were observable at the measurement date.
897077_13_ITEM15_P155_S3	Level 3 - Assets were valued using valuation reports from the respective institutions at the measurement date.
897077_13_ITEM15_P155_S4	The following table presents the hierarchy levels for our postretirement benefit plan investments as of December 31:
897077_13_ITEM15_P156_S0	Our interests in the common collective trust investments are managed by one custodian.
897077_13_ITEM15_P156_S1	Consistent with our investment policy, the custodian has invested the assets across a widely diversified portfolio of U.S. and international equity and fixed income securities.
897077_13_ITEM15_P156_S2	Fair values of each security within the collective trust as of December 31, 2012 were obtained from the custodian and are based on quoted market prices of individual investments; however, since the fund itself does not have immediate liquidity or a quoted market price, these assets are considered Level 2.
897077_13_ITEM15_P157_S0	The common collective funds noted in the above table have estimated fair value using the net asset value per share of investments.
897077_13_ITEM15_P157_S1	Investments can be redeemed immediately at the current net asset value per share based on the fair value of the underlying assets.
897077_13_ITEM15_P158_S0	The categories contain investments in equity securities of smaller growing companies, medium-sized U.S. companies, large value-oriented and growth-oriented companies and foreign companies traded on international markets.

897077_13_ITEM15_P161_S1	Accordingly, the SERP obligates the Company to pay to a participant a Retirement Benefit (as defined in the SERP) upon the occurrence of certain payment events to the extent a participant has a vested right thereto.
897077_13_ITEM15_P161_S2	A participant s right to his or her Retirement Benefit becomes vested in the Company s contributions upon 10 years of Credited Service (as defined in the SERP) or a change in control of the Company.
897077_13_ITEM15_P161_S3	The Retirement Benefit is based on 20% of the final three -year average salary of each participant on or after his or her normal retirement age ( 65 years of age).
897077_13_ITEM15_P161_S4	In the event of the participant s death or a change in control, the participant s vested retirement benefit will be paid in a lump sum to the participant or his or her estate, as applicable, within 90 days after the participant s death or a change in control, as applicable.

897077_13_ITEM15_P185_S0	Purchase obligations of $ 76,338,000 represent an estimate of goods and services to be purchased under outstanding purchase orders not reflected on the Company s balance sheet.
897077_13_ITEM15_P185_S1	New purchase obligations should be received and paid for during the current fiscal year.
897077_13_ITEM15_P186_S0	Like other manufacturers, the Company is subject to a broad range of federal, state, local and foreign laws and requirements, including those concerning air emissions, discharges into waterways, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials, as well as the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances at the Company s facilities and offsite disposal locations, workplace safety and equal employment opportunities.
897077_13_ITEM15_P186_S1	These laws and regulations are constantly changing, and it is impossible to predict with accuracy the effect that changes to such laws and regulations may have on the Company in the future.
897077_13_ITEM15_P187_S0	Like other industrial concerns, the Company s manufacturing operations entail the risk of noncompliance, and there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur material costs or other liabilities as a result thereof.
897077_13_ITEM15_P188_S0	The Company knows that its Indianola, Iowa property is contaminated with chromium which most likely resulted from chrome plating operations which were discontinued before the Company purchased the property.
897077_13_ITEM15_P188_S1	Chlorinated volatile organic compounds have also been detected in water samples on the property, though the source is unknown at this time.
897077_13_ITEM15_P188_S2	The Company voluntarily worked with an environmental consultant and the state of Iowa with respect to these issues and believes it completed its remediation program in June 2006.
897077_13_ITEM15_P188_S3	The work was accomplished within the Company s environmental liability reserve balance.

897077_13_ITEM15_P189_S1	The reserve was for potential ground water contamination/remediation that was identified before the acquisition and believed to have been generated by a third party company located near the Gradall facility.
897077_13_ITEM15_P190_S0	quarter of 2012 that the wells were plugged during the second half of the year.
897077_13_ITEM15_P190_S1	Based on this information, the Company has determined that a reserve is no longer required.
897077_13_ITEM15_P191_S0	The Company knows that Bush Hog s main manufacturing property in Selma, Alabama was contaminated with chlorinated volatile organic compounds which most likely resulted from painting and cleaning operations during the 1960s and 1970s.
897077_13_ITEM15_P191_S1	The contaminated areas were primarily in the location of underground storage tanks and underneath the former waste storage area.
897077_13_ITEM15_P191_S2	Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, Bush Hog s prior owner agreed to and has removed the underground storage tanks at its cost and has remediated the identified contamination in accordance with the regulations of the Alabama Department of Environmental Management.
897077_13_ITEM15_P191_S3	An environmental consulting firm was retained by the prior owner to administer the cleanup and monitor the site on an ongoing basis until the remediation program is complete and approved by the applicable authorities.
897077_13_ITEM15_P192_S0	Certain other assets of the Company contain asbestos that may have to be remediated over time.
897077_13_ITEM15_P192_S1	The Company believes that any subsequent change in the liability associated with the asbestos removal will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

897077_13_ITEM15_P194_S0	QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA (Unaudited) Summarized quarterly financial data for 2012 and 2011 is presented below.
897077_13_ITEM15_P195_S0	Seasonal influences affect the Company s sales and profits, with peak business occurring in May through August.
897077_13_ITEM15_P196_S0	The sum of quarterly earnings per share may not equal total year earnings per share due to rounding of earnings per share amounts, and differences in weighted-average shares and equivalent shares outstanding for each of the periods presented.
897077_13_ITEM15_P197_S0	The fourth quarter 2011 results include the following items: (1) a pretax charge of $1.9 million related to goodwill impairment (2) a $8.6 million gain on bargain purchase relating to Tenco and (3) restructuring cost of $0.9 million relating to a plant closure.
897077_13_ITEM15_P198_S0	The fourth quarter 2012 results include the following items: (1) a pretax charge of $0.7 million related to goodwill impairment (2) a $2.4 million charge relating to various litigation matters and (3) a $1.2 million reversal of an environmental reserve at our Gradall facility .
897077_13_ITEM15_P199_S0	On October 18, 2011 ( Closing Date ), the Company acquired the majority of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Tenco Group Inc .
897077_13_ITEM15_P199_S1	( "Tenco" ) located in St. Valerien, Quebec, Canada.
897077_13_ITEM15_P199_S2	The purchase price was approximately $5.9 million and included substantially all of the ongoing business of Tenco, including the Tenco brand name and all related product names and trademarks (the "Acquisition").
897077_13_ITEM15_P200_S0	The Acquisition was accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations ( ASC Topic 805 ).
897077_13_ITEM15_P200_S1	Accordingly, the total purchase price was allocated on a provisional basis to assets acquired and net liabilities assumed in connection with the Acquisition based on their estimated fair values as of the completion of the Acquisition.
897077_13_ITEM15_P200_S2	These allocations reflected various provisional estimates that were available at the time and are subject to change during the purchase price allocation period as valuations are finalized.
897077_13_ITEM15_P201_S0	Tenco's Canadian operations had been operating under Receivership Orders from the Quebec Superior Court since July 25, 2011 and (ii) Tenco had no additional working capital to pay their vendors timely and could not operate the business in order to service their customers in the ordinary course of business.
897077_13_ITEM15_P202_S0	Tenco was an unprofitable venture, and the seller approached the Company in an effort to sell Tenco.
897077_13_ITEM15_P202_S1	With Tenco in receivership, the only options, in our opinion, available were to sell the business below market value or shut Tenco down and sell off the business in pieces which, we believe, would have been more costly and time consuming.
897077_13_ITEM15_P202_S2	As a result, the Company was able to agree on a favorable purchase price.
897077_13_ITEM15_P203_S0	The primary reason for the Tenco acquisition was to provide the opportunity to expand the Company's presence in the snow removal equipment business in North America, particularly Canada and North East U.S.
897077_13_ITEM15_P203_S1	This acquisition complemented and broadened our range of products in this sector.
897077_13_ITEM15_P204_S0	The fair value of the net assets acquired was approximately $13.7 million , which exceeded the preliminary estimated purchase price of approximately $5.9 million .
897077_13_ITEM15_P204_S1	Accordingly, the Company recognized the excess of the fair value of the net assets over the purchase price of approximately $7.7 million as a gain on bargain purchase.
897077_13_ITEM15_P204_S2	The gain on bargain purchase of approximately $7.7 million was shown separately within income from operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
897077_13_ITEM15_P204_S3	The recorded amount was provisional and subject to change.
897077_13_ITEM15_P204_S4	The Company evaluated the purchase price allocation during 2012 including the opening fair value of inventory, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, property plant and equipment, accrued liabilities and deferred taxes which required the Company to adjust the recorded gain.
897077_13_ITEM15_P205_S0	The following table summarizes the provisional amount recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the Closing Date.
897077_13_ITEM15_P205_S1	Since the acquisition, net adjustments of $0.9 million were made to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with a corresponding adjustment to the bargain purchase gain.
897077_13_ITEM15_P206_S0	A single estimate of fair value results from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and relies heavily on estimates and assumptions.
897077_13_ITEM15_P206_S1	The Company's judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact the Company's results of operations.
897077_13_ITEM15_P206_S2	The December 31, 2011 financial statement balances and disclosure impacted by these adjustments have been retrospectively adjusted.
897077_13_ITEM15_P206_S3	The adjustments were due to final valuation of property, plant and equipment, inventory and other liabilities.
897077_13_ITEM15_P207_S0	The following are the final fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the Acquisition date:
897077_13_ITEM15_P208_S0	Under 805-10, acquisition related costs (i.e., advisory, legal, valuation and other professional fees) are not included as a component of consideration transferred, but are accounted for as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred.
897077_13_ITEM15_P208_S1	The Company incurred $0.6 million of acquisition related costs in 2011.
897077_13_ITEM15_P208_S2	Assuming this transaction had been made at the beginning of any period presented, the consolidated pro-forma results would not be materially different from reported results.
897077_13_ITEM15_P209_S0	For the year ending December 31, 2012 , Tenco's net revenue was $28.4 million and net income was $0.8 million .
897077_13_ITEM15_P209_S1	In the period between the Closing Date and December 31, 2011, Tenco generated approximately $7.0 million of net revenue and $0.2 million net income from operations.

897077_14_ITEM1_P63_S2	The decrease in 2013 was mainly from a change in sales mix between wholegoods and parts.
897077_14_ITEM1_P63_S3	Proprietary replacement parts generally are more profitable and less cyclical than wholegoods.
897077_14_ITEM1_P64_S0	While the Company believes that the end-users of its products evaluate their purchases on the basis of price, reputation and product quality, such purchases are also based on a dealer s service, support of and loyalty to the dealer based on previous purchase experiences, as well as other factors such as product and replacement part availability.

897077_14_ITEM1_P67_S0	The Company s sales, both product and replacement parts, are generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year, because a substantial number of the Company s products are used for maintenance activities such as vegetation maintenance, highway right-of-way maintenance, construction, and street and parking lot sweeping.

897077_14_ITEM1_P69_S0	The Company s products are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world.
897077_14_ITEM1_P69_S1	The principal competitive factors are price, quality, availability, service and reputation.

897077_14_ITEM1_P69_S4	The Company believes that it is able to compete successfully in its markets by effectively managing its manufacturing costs, offering high quality products, developing and designing innovative products and, to some extent, avoiding direct competition with significantly larger potential competitors.
897077_14_ITEM1_P69_S5	There can be no assurance that the Company s competitors will not substantially increase the resources devoted to the development and marketing of products competitive with the Company s products or that new competitors with greater resources will not enter the Company s markets.

897077_14_ITEM1_P70_S2	Management expects that substantially all of the Company s backlog as of December 31, 2013 will be shipped during fiscal year 2014 .
897077_14_ITEM1_P71_S0	The amount of unfilled orders at a particular time is affected by a number of factors, including manufacturing and shipping schedules which, in most instances, are dependent on the Company s seasonal sales programs and the requirements of its customers.
897077_14_ITEM1_P71_S1	Certain of the Company s orders are subject to cancellation at any time before shipment; therefore, a comparison of unfilled orders from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of future actual shipments.

897077_14_ITEM1_P73_S0	The principal raw materials used by the Company include steel, other metal components, hydraulic hoses, paint and tires.

897077_14_ITEM1_P73_S2	No one supplier is responsible for supplying more than 10% of the principal raw materials used by the Company.
897077_14_ITEM1_P74_S0	While the Company manufactures many of the parts for its products, a significant percentage of parts, including most drivelines, gearboxes, industrial engines, and hydraulic components, are purchased from outside suppliers which manufacture to the Company s specifications.

897077_14_ITEM1_P76_S2	The net book value of trademarks was $ 5,500,000 as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 .

897077_14_ITEM1_P78_S1	These laws and regulations are constantly changing, and it is impossible to predict with accuracy the effect that changes to such laws and regulations may have on the Company in the future.
897077_14_ITEM1_P79_S0	Like other industrial concerns, the Company s manufacturing operations entail the risk of noncompliance, and there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur material costs or other liabilities as a result thereof.

897077_14_ITEM1_P80_S1	Chlorinated volatile organic compounds have also been detected in water samples on the property, though the source is unknown at this time.
897077_14_ITEM1_P80_S2	The Company voluntarily worked with an environmental consultant and the state of Iowa with respect to these issues and believes it completed its remediation program in June 2006.

897077_14_ITEM1_P81_S0	Prior to December 31, 2012, the Company had an environmental reserve in the amount of $ 1,185,000 related to the acquisition of Gradall s facility in New Philadelphia, Ohio.
897077_14_ITEM1_P81_S1	The reserve was for potential ground water contamination/remediation that was identified before the acquisition and believed to have been generated by a third party company located near the Gradall facility.
897077_14_ITEM1_P81_S2	Monitoring of the test wells by the City of New Philadelphia as required by the Ohio EPA has shown no increase in contamination over the past 30 years and the Company was informed in the fourth quarter of 2012 that the wells were plugged during the second half of the year.
897077_14_ITEM1_P81_S3	Based on this information, the Company has determined that a reserve is no longer required.
897077_14_ITEM1_P82_S0	The Company knows that Bush Hog s main manufacturing property in Selma, Alabama was contaminated with chlorinated volatile organic compounds which most likely resulted from painting and cleaning operations during the 1960s and 1970s.
897077_14_ITEM1_P82_S1	The contaminated areas were primarily in the location of underground storage tanks and underneath the former waste storage area.
897077_14_ITEM1_P82_S2	Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, Bush Hog s prior owner agreed to and has removed the underground storage tanks at its cost and has remediated the identified contamination in accordance with the regulations of the Alabama Department of Environmental Management.
897077_14_ITEM1_P82_S3	An environmental consulting firm was retained by the prior owner to administer the cleanup and monitor the site on an ongoing basis until the remediation program is complete and approved by the applicable authorities.

897077_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	You should carefully consider each of the risks described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision with respect to the Company s securities.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the following risks develop into actual events, the Company s business, financial condition or results from operations could be materially and adversely affected and you could lose all or part of your investment.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Deterioration of industry conditions could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our business depends to a large extent upon the prospects for the mowing, right-of-way maintenance and agricultural markets in general.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Future prospects of the industry depend largely on factors outside of our control.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Any of those factors could adversely impact demand for our products, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	increase in unfunded pension plan liability due to financial market deterioration.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In addition, our business is susceptible to a number of factors that specifically affect agricultural customer spending patterns, including the following:
897077_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	A downturn in general economic conditions and outlook in the United States and around the world could adversely affect our net sales and earnings.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The strength and profitability of our business depends on the overall demand for our products and upon economic conditions and outlook, including but not limited to economic growth rates; consumer spending levels; financing availability, pricing and terms for our dealers and end-users; employment rates; interest rates; inflation; consumer confidence and general economic and political conditions and expectations in the United States and the other economies in which we conduct business.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	could cause consumers to continue to reduce spending, which may cause them to delay or forgo purchases of our products and could have an adverse effect on our net sales and earnings.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We depend on governmental sales and a decrease in such sales could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales to federal, state and local governmental entities both in the U.S. and in other countries in which we sell our products.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	These sales depend primarily on the levels of budgeted and appropriated expenditures for highway, airport, roadside and parks maintenance by various governmental entities and are affected by changes in local and national economic conditions.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our dependence on, and the price and availability of, raw materials as well as purchased components may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We are subject to fluctuations in market prices for raw materials such as steel and energy.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In addition, although most of the raw materials and purchase components we use are commercially available from a number of sources, we could experience disruptions in the availability of such materials.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P11_S2	If we are unable to purchase materials we require or are unable to pass on price increases to our customers or otherwise reduce our cost of goods sold, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P11_S3	In addition, higher energy costs may negatively affect spending by farmers, including their purchases of our products.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	This analysis requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P13_S2	The cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of time, which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to an even higher degree of uncertainty.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P13_S3	The Company also utilizes market valuation models and other financial ratios, which require the Company to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to its assets and businesses.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , goodwill was $ 32,073,000 , which represents 7% of total assets.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The Company recognized no goodwill impairment in 2013.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The Company recognized goodwill impairment at one of its French operations, Faucheux , of $ 656,000 in 2012 and two of its French operations, SMA and Rousseau , of $1,898,000 in 2011.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P15_S2	The primary reason for the goodwill impairment in 2012 and 2011 was the general economic downturn that continues to affect the Company's European operations.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P15_S3	This caused the Company to revise its expectations about future revenue, which is a significant factor in the discounted cash flow analysis used to estimate the fair value of the Company's reporting units.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P15_S4	During the 2013 impairment analysis review, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 15% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit as of December 31, 2013 would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any of the reporting units.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	During the 2012 impairment analysis review, it was noted that even though the Schwarze and Rivard reporting units' fair value was above carrying value, it was not materially different.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	On December 31, 2013 , there was approximately $6.9 million and $12.3 million of goodwill related to the Schwarze and Rivard reporting units, respectively.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P16_S2	These reporting units would be most likely affected by changes in the Company s assumptions and estimates.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P16_S3	The calculation of fair value could increase or decrease depending on changes in the inputs and assumptions used, such as changes in the reporting unit s future growth rates, discount rates, etc.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We are significantly dependent on information technology.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic and financial information, to manage a variety of business processes and activities, and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations, personnel, customers, and suppliers.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P18_S2	These information technology systems, [some of which are provided and maintained by third parties], may be susceptible to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to hardware failures, computer viruses, hacker attacks, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophic events or other factors.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	and the loss of customers and sales, causing our product sales, financial condition, and operating results to be adversely affected and the reporting of our financial results to be delayed.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	In addition, if we are unable to prevent security breaches or disclosure of non-public information, we may suffer financial and reputational damage, litigation or remediation costs or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners, customers, consumers, or suppliers.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We operate in a highly competitive industry, and some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater resources than we do.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our products are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	We compete with several large national and international companies that offer a broad range of equipment and replacement parts that compete with our products, as well as with numerous small, privately-held manufacturers and suppliers of a limited number of products mainly on a regional basis.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Some of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater financial and other resources at their disposal.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P22_S3	We believe that we are able to compete successfully in our markets by, to some extent, avoiding direct competition with significantly larger potential competitors.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P22_S4	There can be no assurance that our competitors will not substantially increase the resources devoted to the development and marketing of products competitive with our products or that new competitors with greater resources will not enter our markets.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Any failure to effectively compete could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We operate and source internationally, which exposes us to the political, economic and other risks of doing business abroad.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We have operations in a number of countries outside of the United States and we source raw materials and components globally.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Our international operations are subject to the risks normally associated with conducting business in foreign countries, including but not limited to the following:
897077_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	new regulations involving international freight shipments.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the United States and the other countries in which we operate affecting foreign trade, investment and taxation.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	In addition, political developments and governmental regulations and policies in the countries in which we operate directly affect the demand for our products.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	For example, decreases or delays in farm subsidies to our agricultural customers, or changes in environmental policies aimed at limiting mowing activities, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our acquisition strategy may not be successful, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We intend to grow internally and through the acquisition of businesses and assets that will complement our current businesses.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	To date, a material portion of our growth has come through acquisitions.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P29_S2	We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition targets, obtain financing for acquisitions on satisfactory terms or successfully acquire identified targets.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	making acquisitions or prevent us from making certain acquisitions.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P30_S1	These and other acquisition-related factors may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We may be unable to complete or integrate existing or future acquisitions effectively, and businesses we have acquired, or may acquire in the future, may not perform as expected.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We may not be successful in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations and achieving projected synergies.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P32_S1	We could face many risks in integrating acquired businesses, including but not limited to the following:
897077_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	we may encounter unanticipated events, circumstances or legal liabilities.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Our integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts from the management of each entity, including coordinating existing business plans and research and development efforts.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Integrating operations may distract management s attention from the day-to-day operation of the combined companies.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Ultimately, our attempts to integrate the operations, technology and personnel of acquired businesses may not be successful.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P34_S3	If we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses, our future results may be negatively impacted.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	In addition, we may be adversely affected if businesses that we have acquired, or that we acquire in the future, do not perform as expected.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P35_S1	An acquired business could perform below our expectations for a number of reasons, including legislative or regulatory changes that affect the areas in which the acquired business specializes, the loss of customers and dealers, general economic factors that directly affect the acquired business, and the cultural incompatibility of its management team.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Any or all of these reasons could adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The agricultural industry and the mowing and right of way maintenance industry are seasonal and are affected by the weather, and seasonal fluctuations may cause our results of operations and working capital to fluctuate from quarter to quarter.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	In general, agricultural and governmental end-users typically purchase new equipment during the first and second calendar quarters.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Other products such as street sweepers, excavators, snow blowers, front-end loaders and pothole patchers have different seasonal patterns, as do replacement parts in general.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P37_S2	In attempting to achieve efficient utilization of manpower and facilities throughout the year, we estimate seasonal demand months in advance and manufacturing capacity is scheduled in anticipation of such demand.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P37_S3	We utilize a rolling twelve-month sales forecast provided by our marketing divisions and order backlog in order to develop a production plan for our manufacturing facilities.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P37_S4	In addition, many of our marketing departments attempt to equalize demand for their products throughout the calendar year by offering seasonal sales programs which may provide additional incentives, including discounts and extended payment terms, on equipment that is ordered during off-season periods.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P37_S5	Because we spread our production and wholesale shipments throughout the year to take into account the factors described above, sales in any given period may not reflect the timing of dealer orders and retail demand.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Weather conditions and general economic conditions may affect the timing of purchases and actual industry conditions might differ from our forecasts.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Consequently, sudden or significant declines in industry demand could adversely affect our working capital or results of operations.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	If we do not retain key personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees, our business may suffer.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our continued success will depend on, among other things, the efforts and skills of our executive officers, including our president and chief executive officer, and our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified managerial, technical, manufacturing, and sales and marketing personnel.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P40_S1	We do not maintain key man life insurance for any of our employees, and all of our senior management are employed at will.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P40_S2	We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and hire suitable replacements for any of our key employees.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P40_S3	We believe the loss of a key executive officer or other key employee could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We are subject on an ongoing basis to the risk of product liability claims and other litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Like other manufacturers, we are subject to various claims, including product liability claims, arising in the ordinary course of business, and we are a party to various legal proceedings that constitute routine litigation incidental to our business.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P42_S1	We may be exposed to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury, property damage, or both.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P42_S2	We cannot assure you that we will not experience any material product liability losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend the Company against such claims.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P42_S3	While we currently have product liability insurance, we cannot assure you that our product liability insurance coverage will be adequate for any liabilities that may ultimately be incurred or that it will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P42_S4	A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage or a requirement to participate in a product recall may have a materially adverse effect on our business.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We are subject to environmental, health and safety and employment laws and regulations and related compliance expenditures and liabilities.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Like other manufacturers, the Company is subject to a broad range of federal, state, local and foreign laws and requirements, including those concerning air emissions, discharges into waterways, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials, as well as the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances at the Company s facilities and offsite disposal locations, workplace safety and equal employment opportunities.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P44_S1	These laws and regulations are constantly changing, and it is impossible to predict with accuracy the effect that changes to such laws and regulations may have on the Company in the future.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Like other industrial concerns, the Company s manufacturing operations entail the risk of noncompliance, and there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur material costs or other liabilities as a result thereof.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The Company knows that its Indianola, Iowa property is contaminated with chromium which most likely resulted from chrome plating operations which were discontinued before the Company purchased the property.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Chlorinated volatile organic compounds have also been detected in water samples on the property, though the source is unknown at this time.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P46_S2	The Company voluntarily worked with an environmental consultant and the state of Iowa with respect to these issues and believes it completed its remediation program in June 2006.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P46_S3	The work was accomplished within the Company s environmental liability reserve balance.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P46_S4	We requested a no further action classification from the state.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P46_S5	We received a conditional no further action letter in January of 2009.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P46_S6	When we demonstrate stable or improving conditions below residential standards for a certain period of time by monitoring existing wells, we will request an unconditional no further action letter.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The Company knows that Bush Hog s main manufacturing property in Selma, Alabama was contaminated with chlorinated volatile organic compounds which most likely resulted from painting and cleaning operations during the 1960s and 1970s.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P47_S1	The contaminated areas were primarily in the location of underground storage tanks and underneath the former waste storage area.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, Bush Hog s prior owner agreed to and has removed the underground storage tanks at its cost and has remediated the identified contamination in accordance with the regulations of the Alabama Department of Environmental Management.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P47_S3	An environmental consulting firm was retained by the prior owner to administer the cleanup and monitor the site on an ongoing basis until the remediation program is complete and approved by the applicable authorities.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Certain properties of the Company contain asbestos that may have to be remediated over time and it could be additional expense to the Company.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The Company is subject to various other federal, state, and local laws affecting its business, as well as a variety of regulations relating to such matters as working conditions, equal employment opportunities, and product safety.

897077_14_ITEM1A_P50_S0	If we are unable to comply with the terms of our credit arrangements, especially the financial covenants, our credit arrangements could be terminated.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all of the terms of our credit arrangements, especially the financial covenants.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Our ability to comply with such terms depends on the success of our business and our operating results.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Various risks, uncertainties, and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with the terms of our credit arrangements.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P51_S3	If we were out of compliance with any covenant required by our credit arrangements following any applicable cure periods, the banks could terminate their commitments unless we could negotiate a covenant waiver.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P51_S4	The banks could condition such waiver on amendments to the terms of our credit a rrangements that may be unfavorable to us, including, a potential increase to the interest rate we currently pay on outstanding debt under our credit arrangements could increase, which could adversely affect our operating results.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominantly in European countries, Canada and Australia, as a result of the sale of our products in international markets.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P53_S1	While we do hedge again st such fluctuations to an extent (primarily in the U.K. market), we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively manage these risks.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, such as a devaluation of the Euro against the U.S. dollar, could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations or financial condition.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Because the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and its trading volume has generally been low, it may be difficult for you to resell our common stock when desired or at attractive prices.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P55_S0	The trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P55_S1	The closing prices of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange during 2013 ranged from $ 60.69 to $ 33.89 per share, and during 2012 from $ 34.07 to $ 26.20 per share.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Our stock price may fluctuate in response to the risk factors set forth herein and to a number of events and factors, such as quarterly variations in operating and financial results, litigation, changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts, the operating and stock performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us, news reports relating to us or trends in our industry or general economic conditions.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P55_S3	Furthermore, the trading volume of our common stock has generally been low, which may increase the volatility of the market price for our stock.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P55_S4	The stock price volatility and low trading volume may make it difficult for you to resell your shares of our common stock when desired or at attractive prices.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P56_S0	You may experience dilution of your ownership interests due to the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We may issue shares of our previously authorized and unissued securities which will result in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P57_S1	We are currently authorized to issue 20,000,000 shares of common stock.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P57_S2	On December 31, 2013 , 12,123,083 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding, and there were outstanding options and restricted stock awards totaling an additional 417,774 shares of our common stock.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P57_S3	We also have additional shares available for grant under our 2005 Incentive Stock Option Plan and our 2009 Equity Incentive Plan.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P57_S4	Additional stock option or other compensation plans or amendments to existing plans for employees and directors may be adopted.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P57_S5	Issuance of these shares of common stock may dilute the ownership interests of our then existing stockholders.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P57_S6	We may also issue additional shares of our common stock in connection with the hiring of personnel, future acquisitions, such as the 1,700,000 shares issued as consideration for the acquisition of Bush Hog in 2009, future private placements of our securities for capital raising purposes or for other business purposes.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P57_S7	This would further dilute the interests of our existing stockholders.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P58_S0	There is no assurance that we will continue declaring dividends or have the available cash to make dividend payments.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P59_S0	On January 2, 2013, the Board of Directors of the Company increased its quarterly dividend from $.06 per share to $.07 per share.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Although we have paid a cash dividend in each quarter since becoming a public company in 1993, there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or that funds will continue to be available for this purpose in the future.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P59_S2	The declaration and payment of dividends are restricted by the terms of our amended and restated revolving credit agreement, are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, are not cumulative, and will depend upon our profitability, financial condition, capital needs, future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Provisions of our corporate documents may have anti-takeover effects that could prevent a change in control.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Provisions of our charter, bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P61_S1	These provisions include supermajority voting requirements, prohibiting the stockholder from calling stockholder meetings, removal of directors for cause only and prohibiting shareholder actions by written consent.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws state that any amendment to certain provisions, including those provisions regarding the removal of directors and limitations on action by written consent discussed above, be approved by the holders of at least two-thirds of our common stock.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P61_S3	We are also afforded the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which would prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a person who becomes a 15% or greater shareholder for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such status unless certain board or shareholder approvals were obtained.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Future sales, or the possibility of future sales, of a substantial amount of our common stock may depress the price of the shares of our common stock.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Future sales, or the availability for sale in the public market, of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P63_S1	If we or our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or if there is a perception that these sales may occur, the market price of our common stock could decline.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Certain stockholders own a significant amount of our common stock, and their interests may conflict with those of our other stockholders.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P65_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , Capital Southwest Corporation, and its subsidiary Capital Southwest Venture Corporation, beneficially owned approximately 23% of our outstanding common stock and, four other investors - Bgear LLC, Henry Crown and Company, Royce Associates, LLC, and Dimensional Fund Advisors LP - beneficially own approximately 32% of our outstanding common stock.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P65_S1	As a result, either Capital Southwest or the other major stockholders combined could be able to significantly influence the direction of the Company, the election of our Board of Directors and the outcome of any other matter requiring stockholder approval, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and together with other beneficially owned investors, to prevent or cause a change in control of the Company.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P65_S2	Also, pursuant to contractual obligations, each of Capital Southwest Venture Corporation, Capital Southwest Corporation and Duroc LLC, an affiliate of Bgear LLC and Henry Crown and Company, was entitled to certain rights with respect to the registration of the common stock owned by them under the Securities Act.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P65_S3	Pursuant to such registration rights, on March 12, 2012 we filed a registration statement related to the common stock owned by such entities and such registration statement was declared effective by the SEC.
897077_14_ITEM1A_P66_S0	The interests of Capital Southwest and other major stockholders may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.
897077_14_ITEM1B_P0_S0	The Company has no unresolved staff comments to report pursuant to Item 1B.

897077_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	These laws and regulations are constantly changing, and it is impossible to predict with accuracy the effect that changes to such laws and regulations may have on the Company in the future.
897077_14_ITEM3_P1_S0	Like other industrial concerns, the Company s manufacturing operations entail the risk of noncompliance, and there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur material costs or other liabilities as a result thereof.

897077_14_ITEM3_P4_S1	The Company believes that any subsequent change in the liability associated with the asbestos removal will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations.
897077_14_ITEM3_P5_S0	In December of 2012, a federal district court jury in Louisiana found that Gradall was unjustly enriched in the amount of $1,000,000 plus interest when it sold several telescopic fire apparatuses after properly terminating what the jury determined to be an enforceable contract with the plaintiff, a fire truck manufacturer.

897077_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	The Company s net sales in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 ( 2013 ) were $ 676,836,000 , an increase of $ 48,434,000 or 7.7% compared to $ 628,402,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 ( 2012 ).
897077_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	The increase was mainly from improved sales in the Company's North American and Agricultural Divisions.
897077_14_ITEM7_P1_S2	The Industrial Division was up 12.6% as sales of all product lines increased over 2012.
897077_14_ITEM7_P1_S3	Likewise, sales in the Agricultural Division were up 7.4% over last year as mowing products for all three major brands showed improvement.
897077_14_ITEM7_P1_S4	Sales in the European Division were slightly up compared to 2012 as markets for our products showed increases in the second half of 2013 for the first time in several years.
897077_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	North American Industrial sales (net) were $ 296,617,000 in 2013 compared to $ 263,353,000 in 2012 , an increase of $ 33,264,000 or 12.6% .
897077_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	The increase was primarily from higher sales of sweepers, excavator, vacuum trucks and snow equipment as demand for infrastructure maintenance equipment was strong for most of 2013.
897077_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	North American Agricultural sales (net) were $ 215,340,000 in 2013 compared to $ 200,467,000 in 2012 , representing an increase of $ 14,873,000 or 7.4% .
897077_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	The increase in sales compared to 2012 was from improved demand for Bush Hog, Schulte and Rhino products in the agricultural market in North America.
897077_14_ITEM7_P3_S2	Favorable weather conditions during the middle of 2013 helped improve sales to both row crop and hobby farmers.
897077_14_ITEM7_P3_S3	Commodity prices retreated somewhat during the year from levels experienced over prior years, but still remain strong.
897077_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	European sales (net) increased $ 297,000 or 0.2% to $ 164,879,000 in 2013 compared to $ 164,582,000 in 2012 .
897077_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	This slight increase was mainly from improved sales during the last half of 2013 as European markets showed some signs of improvement after being in decline for the last several years.
897077_14_ITEM7_P4_S2	However, challenging market conditions and uncertainty in the European economy continued to affect this Division.
897077_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	Gross margins for 2013 were $ 158,510,000 ( 23.4% of net sales) compared to $ 143,512,000 ( 22.8% of net sales) in 2012 , an increase of $ 14,998,000 .
897077_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	The increase was from higher sales volume during 2013 which led to favorable production efficiencies.
897077_14_ITEM7_P5_S2	Increased lower margin tractor and chassis sales combined with lower sales of higher margin replacement parts negatively affecting the gross profit in 2013.
897077_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG A ) were $ 107,773,000 ( 15.9% of net sales) in 2013 compared to $ 97,507,000 ( 15.5% of net sales) in 2012 .
897077_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	The increase of $ 10,266,000 in SG A in 2013 was primarily litigation expenses from a patent infringement lawsuit, which we were successful in defending, in the amount of $2,137,000, $972,000 of acquisition related expenses and $586,000 of additional stock option expense related to the accelerated vesting of options to retirement eligible recipients.
897077_14_ITEM7_P6_S2	Also during 2013, the Company had restructuring costs at one of its French operations, higher performance based incentive compensation expense, increased sales commissions on higher sales and increased trade show expenses in both North America and Europe.
897077_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	Interest expense for 2013 was $ 1,161,000 compared to $ 1,620,000 in 2012 , a decrease of $ 459,000 or 28.3% .
897077_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	The decrease came from reduced borrowings in 2013 compared to 2012 .
897077_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	Other income (expense), net was income of $ 1,626,000 during 2013 compared to an expense of $ 517,000 in 2012 .
897077_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	The income in 2013 included a grant of $475,000 from the UK government related to R D training and employment, a $70,000 gain realized from the sale of the Company's Memphis warehouse in the first quarter of 2013 and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
897077_14_ITEM7_P8_S2	In 2012 the expense was entirely the result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations.

897077_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	Due to the delay in signing the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 which extended the research and development tax credits, the Company was not able to include $350,000 of tax credits in its 2012 financial statements but instead recognized this tax benefit in the first quarter of 2013 .

897077_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	The increase was mainly due to the acquisition of Tenco in October of 2011 and improved sales of mowing and vacuum truck equipment in the Industrial Division.
897077_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	The Company's Agricultural Division was slightly down as agricultural markets experienced slower growth as farmers remained cautious about the weak U.S. economy.

897077_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	The decrease was from market conditions and the summer drought that affected the Midwest part of the U.S. during the first nine months of 2012.
897077_14_ITEM7_P13_S2	However, preseason orders during the last quarter of 2012 for both Bush Hog and Rhino products were up compared to 2011.
897077_14_ITEM7_P13_S3	This improvement reflected strengthening in the agricultural sector by increases in commodity prices and farm incomes.
897077_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	European sales (net) decreased $ 5,424,000 or 3.2% to $ 164,582,000 in 2012 compared to $ 170,006,000 in 2011 .

897077_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	The increase was from the acquisition of Tenco in the amount of $4,378,000 and improved vacuum trucks and mowers sales in the Company's Industrial Division.
897077_14_ITEM7_P15_S2	Gross margin percentages also improved over last year as a result of continued improvements from efficiency initiatives which helped lower manufacturing costs.

897077_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	The increase of $ 5,160,000 in SG A in 2012 was primarily from the acquisition of Tenco in the amount of $3,515,000.

897077_14_ITEM7_P17_S3	The primary reason for the goodwill impairment in 2012 and 2011 was the general economic downturn that continues to affect the Company's European operations.
897077_14_ITEM7_P17_S4	All three companies are part of its European Division.

897077_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	Due to the delay in signing the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 which extended the research and development tax credits, the Company was not able to include these tax credits in its 2012 financial statements.
897077_14_ITEM7_P19_S2	This benefit will be recognized in the first quarter of 2013.
897077_14_ITEM7_P19_S3	Net Income for 2012 was $ 28,903,000 compared to $ 32,687,000 in 2011 due to the factors described above.

897077_14_ITEM7_P22_S2	Accounts receivable historically build in the first and fourth quarters of each year as a result of pre-season sales.
897077_14_ITEM7_P22_S3	These sales help balance the Company s production during the first and fourth quarters.
897077_14_ITEM7_P22_S4	Some of the Company s recent acquisitions which are not involved in vegetation maintenance have helped to soften this seasonality pattern.

897077_14_ITEM7_P29_S1	The decrease of cash from operating activities resulted from sales driven increases in accounts receivable levels.

897077_14_ITEM7_P32_S1	The agreement also contains various covenants relating to limitations on indebtedness, limitations on investments and acquisitions, limitations on sale of properties and limitations on liens and capital expenditures.
897077_14_ITEM7_P32_S2	The revolving credit agreement also contains other customary covenants, representations and events of defaults.

897077_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	Management believes the bank credit facility and the Company s ability to internally generate funds from operations should be sufficient to meet the Company s cash requirements for the foreseeable future.
897077_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	However, challenges affecting the banking industry and credit markets in general can potentially cause changes to credit availability, which creates a level of uncertainty.
897077_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	The Company believes that inflation generally has not had a material impact on its operations or liquidity.
897077_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	The Company is exposed to the risk that the price of energy, steel and other purchased components may increase and the Company may not be able to increase the price of its products correspondingly.
897077_14_ITEM7_P35_S2	If this occurs, the Company s results of operations would be adversely impacted.
897077_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	In July 2013, the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes, were amended to provide specific guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists at the reporting date.
897077_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	The amendment requires entities to present an unrecognized tax benefit as a reduction to the deferred tax asset generated by the net operating loss carryforward, similar tax loss, or tax credit carryforward, if such items are available to be used to offset the unrecognized tax benefit.
897077_14_ITEM7_P36_S2	These provisions are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2013 and should be applied prospectively to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist at the effective date, with retrospective application permitted.

897077_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	The SEC adopted the conflict mineral rules under Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act on August 22, 2012.
897077_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	The rules require public companies to disclose information about their use of specific minerals originating from and financing armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries.
897077_14_ITEM7_P38_S2	The conflict mineral rules cover minerals frequently used to manufacture a wide array of electronic and industrial products including semiconductor devices.
897077_14_ITEM7_P38_S3	The rules do not ban the use of minerals from conflict sources, but require public disclosure beginning with calendar year 2013.
897077_14_ITEM7_P38_S4	We have determined that we are subject to the rules and are evaluating our supply chain and continue to develop processes to assess the impacts and comply with the regulation.
897077_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	The Company does not have any obligation, under any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the Company is a party, that has or is reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
897077_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	The following table shows the Company s approximate obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013 :
897077_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	Definitions: (A) Long-term debt obligation means a principal payment obligation under long-term borrowings.
897077_14_ITEM7_P41_S1	(B) Capital lease obligation means a principal payment obligation under a lease classified as a capital lease.
897077_14_ITEM7_P41_S2	(C) Interest obligation represents interest due on long-term debt and capital lease obligations.
897077_14_ITEM7_P41_S3	Interest on long-term debt assumes all floating rates of interest remain the same as those in effect at December 31, 2013 .
897077_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	(D) Operating lease obligation means a payment obligation under a lease classified as an operating lease.
897077_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	(E) Purchase obligation means an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the registrant that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions.
897077_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	Critical Accounting Estimates Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ).
897077_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
897077_14_ITEM7_P43_S2	Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
897077_14_ITEM7_P43_S3	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
897077_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the financial statements.
897077_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
897077_14_ITEM7_P44_S2	For further information on the critical accounting policies, see Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
897077_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	The Company evaluates the collectability of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors.
897077_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	In circumstances where it is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations, the Company records a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what it believes will be collected.
897077_14_ITEM7_P45_S2	For all other customers, it recognizes reserves for bad debt based on historical experience of bad debts as a percent of revenues for each business unit, adjusted for relative improvements or deteriorations in the aging and changes in current economic conditions.
897077_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	The Company evaluates all receivables that are over 60 days old and will reserve specifically on a 90-day basis.
897077_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	The Company has a secured or insured interest on most of its wholegoods that each customer purchases.
897077_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	This allows the Company, in times of a difficult economy when the customer is unable to pay or has filed for bankruptcy, to repossess its inventory.
897077_14_ITEM7_P47_S2	This also allows Alamo Group to maintain only a reserve over its cost, which usually represents the margin on the original sales price.
897077_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $ 2,738,000 on December 31, 2013 , and $ 3,077,000 on December 31, 2012 .
897077_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	The decrease was mainly from the Company s Industrial Division.
897077_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	On December 31, 2013 , the Company had $ 16,724,000 in reserves for sales discounts compared to $ 15,005,000 on December 31, 2012 on product shipped to our customers under various promotional programs.
897077_14_ITEM7_P49_S1	The increase was due primarily to increased sales volume of the Company s agricultural products during the 2013 pre-season, which runs during the third and fourth quarters of each year with orders shipped through the second quarter of 2014.
897077_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	The Company reviews the reserve quarterly based on analysis made on each program outstanding at the time.
897077_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	The Company bases its reserves on historical data relating to discounts taken by the customer under each program.
897077_14_ITEM7_P51_S1	Historically, between 85% and 95% of the Company s customers who qualify for each program actually take the discount that is available.
897077_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	The Company had a reserve of $ 8,596,000 on December 31, 2013 and $ 9,099,000 on December 31, 2012 to cover obsolete and slow moving inventory.
897077_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	The decrease in the reserve was mainly from the Industrial Division and to a lesser extent the Company's Agricultural Division.
897077_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	The obsolete and slow moving inventory policy states that the reserve is to be calculated as follows: 1) no inventory usage over a three-year period is deemed obsolete and reserved at 100 percent; and 2) slow moving inventory with little usage requires a 100 percent reserve on items that have a quantity greater than a three-year supply.
897077_14_ITEM7_P53_S1	There are exceptions to the obsolete and slow moving classifications if approved by an officer of the Company, based on specific identification of an item or items that are deemed to be either included or excluded from this classification.
897077_14_ITEM7_P53_S2	In cases where there is no historical data, management makes a judgment based on a specific review of the inventory in question to determine what reserves, if any, are appropriate.
897077_14_ITEM7_P53_S3	New products or parts are generally excluded from the reserve policy until a three-year history has been established.
897077_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	The reserve is reviewed and, if necessary, adjustments are made on a quarterly basis.
897077_14_ITEM7_P54_S1	The Company relies on historical information when available to support its reserve.
897077_14_ITEM7_P54_S2	The Company does not adjust the reserve balance until the inventory is liquidated.
897077_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	The Company s warranty policy is generally to provide its customers warranty for up to one year on all wholegood units and 90 days on parts, though some components can have warranty for longer terms.
897077_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	Warranty reserve, as a percentage of sales, is generally calculated by looking at the current twelve months expenses and prorating that amount based on twelve months sales with a ninety-day to six-month lag period.
897077_14_ITEM7_P56_S1	The Company s historical experience is that an end-user takes approximately 90 days to six months from the receipt of the unit to file a warranty claim.
897077_14_ITEM7_P56_S2	A warranty reserve is established for each different marketing group.
897077_14_ITEM7_P56_S3	Reserve balances are evaluated on a quarterly basis and adjustments made when required.
897077_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	The current liability warranty reserve balance was $ 4,994,000 on December 31, 2013 and $ 5,007,000 on December 31, 2012 .
897077_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	We test goodwill for impairment annually, at the reporting unit level, and whenever events or circumstances make it likely that an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell all or a portion of a reporting unit.
897077_14_ITEM7_P58_S1	We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis.
897077_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	Goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing a qualitative assessment or a two-step process.
897077_14_ITEM7_P59_S1	We have an option to make a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit's goodwill for impairment.
897077_14_ITEM7_P59_S2	If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary.
897077_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	For reporting units where we perform the two-step process, the first step requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill.
897077_14_ITEM7_P60_S1	If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not considered impaired.
897077_14_ITEM7_P60_S2	If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, there is an indication that an impairment may exist and the second step is required.
897077_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	In step two, the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities.
897077_14_ITEM7_P61_S1	If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill, the difference is recognized as an impairment loss.
897077_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis.
897077_14_ITEM7_P62_S1	This analysis requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates.
897077_14_ITEM7_P62_S2	The cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of time, which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to an even higher degree of uncertainty.
897077_14_ITEM7_P62_S3	The Company also utilizes market valuation models and other financial ratios, which require the Company to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to its assets and businesses.
897077_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , goodwill was $ 32,073,000 , which represents 7% of total assets.
897077_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	The Company recognized no goodwill impairment in 2013.
897077_14_ITEM7_P64_S1	The Company recognized goodwill impairment at one of its French operations, Faucheux of $ 656,000 in 2012 and at two of its French operations, SMA and Rousseau of $1,898,000 in 2011.
897077_14_ITEM7_P64_S2	The primary reason for the goodwill impairment in 2012 and 2011 was the general economic downturn that continues to affect the Company's European operations.
897077_14_ITEM7_P64_S3	This caused the Company to revise its expectations about future revenue, which is a significant factor in the discounted cash flow analysis used to estimate the fair value of the Company's reporting units.
897077_14_ITEM7_P64_S4	During the 2013 impairment analysis review, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 15% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit as of December 31, 2013 would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any of the reporting units.
897077_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	During the 2012 impairment analysis review, it was noted that even though the Schwarze and Rivard reporting units' fair value was above carrying value, it was not materially different.
897077_14_ITEM7_P65_S1	On December 31, 2013 , there was approximately $6.9 million and $12.3 million of goodwill related to the Schwarze and Rivard reporting units, respectively.
897077_14_ITEM7_P65_S2	These reporting units would be most likely affected by changes in the Company s assumptions and estimates.
897077_14_ITEM7_P65_S3	The calculation of fair value could increase or decrease depending on changes in the inputs and assumptions used, such as changes in the reporting unit s future growth rates, discount rates, etc.
897077_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	Management believes that the estimated valuations it arrived at are reasonable and consistent with what other marketplace participants would use in valuing the Company's components.
897077_14_ITEM7_P66_S1	However, management cannot give any assurance that these market values will not change in the future.
897077_14_ITEM7_P66_S2	For example, if discount rates demanded by the market increase, this could lead to reduced valuations under the income approach.
897077_14_ITEM7_P66_S3	If the Company's projections are not achieved in the future, this could lead management to reassess their assumptions and lead to reduced valuations under the income approach.
897077_14_ITEM7_P66_S4	If the market price of the Company's stock decreases, this could cause the Company to reassess the reasonableness of the implied control premium, which might cause management to assume a higher discount rate under the income approach which could lead to reduced valuations.
897077_14_ITEM7_P66_S5	If future similar transactions exhibit lower multiples than those observed in the past, this could lead to reduced valuations under the similar transactions approach.
897077_14_ITEM7_P66_S6	And finally, if there is a general decline in the stock market and particularly in those companies selected as comparable to the Company's components, this could lead to reduced valuations under the public company market multiple approach.
897077_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	The Company's annual impairment test is performed during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.
897077_14_ITEM7_P67_S1	Given the current market conditions and continued economic uncertainty, the fair value of the Company's components could deteriorate which could result in the need to record impairment charges in future periods.
897077_14_ITEM7_P67_S2	The Company also monitors potential triggering events including changes in the business climate in which it operates, attrition of key personnel, volatility in the capital markets, the Company's market capitalization compared to its book value, the Company's recent operating performance, and the Company's financial projections.
897077_14_ITEM7_P67_S3	The occurrence of one or more triggering events could require additional impairment testing, which could result in future impairment charges.
897077_14_ITEM7_P67_S4	In particular, since the Schwarze and Rivard , reporting units' carrying value are not materially different from fair value, any changes to the Company's assumptions could lead to an indicated impairment in step one, requiring the Company to proceed to step two and potentially record an impairment charge.
897077_14_ITEM7_P67_S5	See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding goodwill.
897077_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The Company is exposed to various financial market risks.
897077_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates.
897077_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The Company does not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
897077_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	A portion of the Company s operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities in international jurisdictions.
897077_14_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The Company manufactures its products primarily in the United States, the U.K., France, Canada and Australia.
897077_14_ITEM7A_P2_S2	The Company sells its products primarily within the markets where the products are produced, but certain of the Company s sales from its U.K. and Canadian operations are denominated in other currencies.
897077_14_ITEM7A_P2_S3	As a result, the Company s financials, specifically the value of its foreign assets, could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the other markets in which the subsidiaries of the Company distribute their products.
897077_14_ITEM7A_P3_S0	To mitigate the short-term effect of changes in currency exchange rates on the Company s functional currency-based sales, the Company s U.K. and Canadian subsidiaries regularly enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge over 90% of its future net foreign currency cash receipts over a period of six months.
897077_14_ITEM7A_P3_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , the Company had $ 2,884,000 outstanding in forward exchange contracts related to accounts receivable.
897077_14_ITEM7A_P3_S2	A 15% fluctuation in exchange rates for these currencies would change the fair value by approximately $ 433,000 .
897077_14_ITEM7A_P3_S3	However, since these contracts hedge foreign currency denominated transactions, any change in the fair value of the contracts should be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged.
897077_14_ITEM7A_P4_S0	On December 31, 2013 , the fair value of these agreements was in an unfavorable position; therefore, the derivative financial instruments were recorded as a gain of $17,000 , which has been recognized in other income (expense), net.
897077_14_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The Company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominantly in European countries, Canada and Australia, as a result of the sale of its products in international markets.
897077_14_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the U.K. are used to hedge against the earnings effects of such fluctuations.
897077_14_ITEM7A_P5_S2	On December 31, 2013 , the result of a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies in which the Company s sales are denominated would have resulted in a decrease in gross profit of $ 5,475,000 .
897077_14_ITEM7A_P5_S3	Comparatively, on December 31, 2012 , the result of a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which the Company s sales are denominated would have resulted in a decrease in gross profit of approximately $ 5,275,000 .
897077_14_ITEM7A_P6_S0	This calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar.
897077_14_ITEM7A_P6_S1	In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, which are a changed dollar value of the resulting sales, changes in exchange rates may also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive.
897077_14_ITEM7A_P6_S2	The Company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices.
897077_14_ITEM7A_P6_S3	The translation adjustment during 2013 was a loss of $479,000 .
897077_14_ITEM7A_P6_S4	On December 31, 2013 , the British pound closed at 0.6040 relative to the U.S. dollar, and the Euro closed at 0.7275 relative to the U.S. dollar.
897077_14_ITEM7A_P6_S5	By comparison, on December 31, 2012 , the British pound closed at 0.6155 relative to the U.S. dollar, and the Euro closed at 0.7579 relative to the U.S. dollar.
897077_14_ITEM7A_P6_S6	No assurance can be given as to future valuation of the British pound or Euro or how further movements in those or other currencies could affect future earnings or the financial position of the Company.
897077_14_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Interest Rate Risk The majority of the Company s long-term debt bears interest at variable rates.
897077_14_ITEM7A_P7_S1	Accordingly, the Company s net income is affected by changes in interest rates.
897077_14_ITEM7A_P7_S2	Assuming the average level of borrowings at variable rates and a two hundred basis point change in the 2013 average interest rate under these borrowings, the Company s 2013 interest expense would have changed by approximately $ 50,000 .
897077_14_ITEM7A_P8_S0	In the event of an adverse change in interest rates, management could take actions to mitigate its exposure.
897077_14_ITEM7A_P8_S1	Further, this analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment.
897077_14_ITEM7A_P8_S2	However, challenges affecting the banking industry and credit markets in general can potentially cause changes to credit availability and cost of borrowing which creates a level of uncertainty.
897077_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	The financial statements and supplementary data described in Item 15 of this report and included on pages 45 through 76 of this report are incorporated herein by reference.

897077_14_ITEM15_P5_S1	The Company s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
897077_14_ITEM15_P6_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
897077_14_ITEM15_P6_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
897077_14_ITEM15_P7_S0	The Company s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 using the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
897077_14_ITEM15_P7_S1	Based on this assessment, the Company s management concludes that, as of December 31, 2013 , the Company s internal controls over financial reporting were effective based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework.

897077_14_ITEM15_P11_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
897077_14_ITEM15_P11_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
897077_14_ITEM15_P11_S3	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
897077_14_ITEM15_P11_S4	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
897077_14_ITEM15_P12_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
897077_14_ITEM15_P12_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
897077_14_ITEM15_P13_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
897077_14_ITEM15_P13_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

897077_14_ITEM15_P18_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
897077_14_ITEM15_P19_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
897077_14_ITEM15_P19_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
897077_14_ITEM15_P19_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
897077_14_ITEM15_P20_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Alamo Group Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2013 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

897077_14_ITEM15_P25_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
897077_14_ITEM15_P25_S1	Judgments related to asset impairment and certain reserves are particularly subject to change.
897077_14_ITEM15_P25_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.

897077_14_ITEM15_P30_S0	Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable.
897077_14_ITEM15_P30_S1	The credit risk is limited because of the large numbers and types of customers and their geographic dispersion.
897077_14_ITEM15_P31_S0	Inventories of U.S. operating subsidiaries are stated at the lower of cost (last-in, first-out method) ( LIFO ) or market, and the Company s international subsidiaries inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) ( FIFO ) or market.
897077_14_ITEM15_P32_S0	Property, plant, and equipment are stated on the basis of cost.
897077_14_ITEM15_P32_S1	Major renewals and betterments are charged to the property accounts while replacements, maintenance and repairs, which do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets, are expensed to the current period.
897077_14_ITEM15_P33_S0	Depreciation is provided at amounts calculated to amortize the cost of the assets over their estimated useful economic lives using the straight-line method.
897077_14_ITEM15_P34_S0	Goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of businesses acquired.
897077_14_ITEM15_P34_S1	We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis.
897077_14_ITEM15_P35_S0	Goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing a qualitative assessment or a two-step process.
897077_14_ITEM15_P35_S1	We have an option to make a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit's goodwill for impairment.
897077_14_ITEM15_P35_S2	If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary.
897077_14_ITEM15_P36_S0	For reporting units where we perform the two-step process, the first step requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill.
897077_14_ITEM15_P36_S1	If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not considered impaired.
897077_14_ITEM15_P36_S2	If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, there is an indication that an impairment may exist and the second step is required.
897077_14_ITEM15_P37_S0	In step two, the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities.
897077_14_ITEM15_P37_S1	If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill, the difference is recognized as an impairment loss.
897077_14_ITEM15_P38_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis.
897077_14_ITEM15_P38_S1	This analysis requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates.
897077_14_ITEM15_P38_S2	The cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of time, which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to an even higher degree of uncertainty.
897077_14_ITEM15_P38_S3	The Company also utilizes market valuation models and other financial ratios, which require the Company to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to its assets and businesses.
897077_14_ITEM15_P39_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , goodwill was $ 32,073,000 , which represents 7% of total assets.
897077_14_ITEM15_P40_S0	The Company recognized no goodwill impairment in 2013.
897077_14_ITEM15_P40_S1	The Company recognized goodwill impairment at one of its French operations, Faucheux , of $ 656,000 in 2012 and two of its French operations, SMA and Rousseau , of $1,898,000 in 2011.
897077_14_ITEM15_P40_S2	The primary reason for the goodwill impairment in 2012 and 2011 was the general economic downturn that continues to affect the Company's European operations.
897077_14_ITEM15_P40_S3	This caused the Company to revise its expectations about future revenue, which is a significant factor in the discounted cash flow analysis used to estimate the fair value of the Company's reporting units.
897077_14_ITEM15_P40_S4	During the 2013 impairment analysis review, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 15% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit as of December 31, 2013 would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any of the reporting units.
897077_14_ITEM15_P41_S0	During the 2012 impairment analysis review, it was noted that even though the Schwarze and Rivard reporting units' fair value was above carrying value, it was not materially different.
897077_14_ITEM15_P41_S1	On December 31, 2013 , there was approximately $6.9 million and $12.3 million of goodwill related to the Schwarze and Rivard reporting units, respectively.
897077_14_ITEM15_P41_S2	These reporting units would be most likely affected by changes in the Company s assumptions and estimates.
897077_14_ITEM15_P41_S3	The calculation of fair value could increase or decrease depending on changes in the inputs and assumptions used, such as changes in the reporting unit s future growth rates, discount rates, etc.
897077_14_ITEM15_P42_S0	Management believes that the estimated valuations it arrived at are reasonable and consistent with what other marketplace participants would use in valuing the Company's components.
897077_14_ITEM15_P42_S1	However, management cannot give any assurance that these market values will not change in the future.
897077_14_ITEM15_P42_S2	For example, if discount rates demanded by the market increase, this could lead to reduced valuations under the income approach.
897077_14_ITEM15_P42_S3	If the Company's projections are not achieved in the future, this could lead management to reassess their assumptions and lead to reduced valuations under the income approach.
897077_14_ITEM15_P42_S4	If the market price of the Company's stock decreases, this could cause the Company to reassess the reasonableness of the implied control premium, which might cause management to assume a higher discount rate under the income approach which could lead to reduced valuations.
897077_14_ITEM15_P42_S5	If future similar transactions exhibit lower multiples than those observed in the past, this could lead to reduced valuations under the similar transactions approach.
897077_14_ITEM15_P42_S6	And finally, if there is a general decline in the stock market and particularly in those companies selected as comparable to the Company's components, this could lead to reduced valuations under the public company market multiple approach.
897077_14_ITEM15_P43_S0	Given the current market conditions and continued economic uncertainty, the fair value of the Company's components could deteriorate which could result in the need to record impairment charges in future periods.
897077_14_ITEM15_P43_S1	The Company also monitors potential triggering events including changes in the business climate in which it operates, attrition of key personnel, volatility in the capital markets, the Company's market capitalization compared to its book value, the Company's recent operating performance, and the Company's financial projections.
897077_14_ITEM15_P43_S2	The occurrence of one or more triggering events could require additional impairment testing, which could result in future impairment charges.
897077_14_ITEM15_P43_S3	In particular, since the Schwarze and Rivard reporting units' carrying values are not materially different from fair value, any changes to the Company's assumptions could lead to an indicated impairment in step one, requiring the Company to proceed to step two and potentially record an impairment charge.
897077_14_ITEM15_P44_S0	See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding goodwill.
897077_14_ITEM15_P45_S0	The Company's intangible assets with indefinite useful lives not subject to amortization consists of trade names.
897077_14_ITEM15_P45_S1	The net book value of these trade names was $ 5,500,000 as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 .
897077_14_ITEM15_P45_S2	This consisted of the Gradall trade name valued at $3,600,000 and the Bush Hog trade name valued at $1,900,000 .
897077_14_ITEM15_P46_S0	The Company tests its indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis at year-end, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset could be below its carrying amount.
897077_14_ITEM15_P46_S1	The impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, determined using the relief from royalty method, with its carrying amount.
897077_14_ITEM15_P46_S2	An impairment loss would be recognized for the carrying amount in excess of its fair value.
897077_14_ITEM15_P47_S0	Identifiable intangible assets are recorded at estimated cost.
897077_14_ITEM15_P47_S1	Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
897077_14_ITEM15_P48_S0	In connection with the February 3, 2006 purchase of all the net assets of the Gradall excavator business, the Company assumed sponsorship of two Gradall non-contributory defined benefit pension plans, both of which were frozen with respect to both future benefit accruals and future new entrants.

897077_14_ITEM15_P55_S2	These pre-season shipments carry descending discounts in conjunction with delayed payment terms of up to six months from the dealer s requested delivery date.
897077_14_ITEM15_P56_S0	Revenue from sales is recorded net of a provision for discounts that are anticipated to be earned and deducted at time of payment by the customer.
897077_14_ITEM15_P56_S1	These approximated discounts represent an average of historical amounts taken and are adjusted as program terms are changed.

897077_14_ITEM15_P64_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and are measured by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to the future years in which deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized.
897077_14_ITEM15_P65_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.
897077_14_ITEM15_P65_S1	The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.
897077_14_ITEM15_P65_S2	Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.
897077_14_ITEM15_P65_S3	Based upon projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences.

897077_14_ITEM15_P68_S0	All option plans contain anti-dilutive provisions that permit an adjustment of the number of shares of the Company s common stock represented by each option for any change in capitalization.
897077_14_ITEM15_P69_S0	The Company calculated the fair value for options with the following weighted-average assumptions for 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 :
897077_14_ITEM15_P70_S0	The carrying values of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses, approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these items.

897077_14_ITEM15_P74_S1	In circumstances where it is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations, the Company records a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what it believes will be collected.
897077_14_ITEM15_P74_S2	For all other customers, it recognizes reserves for bad debt based on historical experience of bad debts as a percent of revenues for each business unit, adjusted for relative improvements or deteriorations in the aging and changes in current economic conditions.
897077_14_ITEM15_P75_S0	The Company evaluates all receivables that are over 60 days old and will reserve specifically on a 90 -day basis.
897077_14_ITEM15_P76_S0	The Company has a secured or insured interest on most of its wholegoods that each customer purchases.
897077_14_ITEM15_P76_S1	This allows the Company, in times of a difficult economy when the customer is unable to pay or has filed for bankruptcy, to repossess its inventory.
897077_14_ITEM15_P76_S2	This also allows Alamo Group to maintain only a reserve over its cost, which usually represents the margin on the original sales price.
897077_14_ITEM15_P77_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $ 2,738,000 on December 31, 2013 , and $ 3,077,000 on December 31, 2012 .
897077_14_ITEM15_P77_S1	The decrease was mainly from the Company s Industrial Division.
897077_14_ITEM15_P78_S0	On December 31, 2013 , the Company had $ 16,724,000 in reserves for sales discounts compared to $ 15,005,000 on December 31, 2012 on product shipped to our customers under various promotional programs.
897077_14_ITEM15_P78_S1	The increase was due primarily to increased sales volume of the Company s agricultural products during the 2013 pre-season, which runs during the third and fourth quarters of each year with orders shipped through the second quarter of 2014.
897077_14_ITEM15_P79_S0	The Company reviews the reserve quarterly based on analysis made on each program outstanding at the time.
897077_14_ITEM15_P80_S0	The Company bases its reserves on historical data relating to discounts taken by the customer under each program.
897077_14_ITEM15_P80_S1	Historically, between 85% and 95% of the Company s customers who qualify for each program actually take the discount that is available.
897077_14_ITEM15_P81_S0	The Company had a reserve of $ 8,596,000 on December 31, 2013 and $ 9,099,000 on December 31, 2012 to cover obsolete and slow moving inventory.
897077_14_ITEM15_P81_S1	The decrease in the reserve was mainly from the Industrial Division and to a lesser extent the Company's Agricultural Division.
897077_14_ITEM15_P82_S0	The obsolete and slow moving inventory policy states that the reserve is to be calculated as follows: 1) no inventory usage over a three -year period is deemed obsolete and reserved at 100 percent ; and 2) slow moving inventory with little usage requires a 100 percent reserve on items that have a quantity greater than a three -year supply.
897077_14_ITEM15_P82_S1	There are exceptions to the obsolete and slow moving classifications if approved by an officer of the Company, based on specific identification of an item or items that are deemed to be either included or excluded from this classification.
897077_14_ITEM15_P82_S2	In cases where there is no historical data, management makes a judgment based on a specific review of the inventory in question to determine what reserves, if any, are appropriate.
897077_14_ITEM15_P82_S3	New products or parts are generally excluded from the reserve policy until a three -year history has been established.
897077_14_ITEM15_P83_S0	The Company s warranty policy is generally to provide its customers warranty for up to one year on all wholegood units and 90 days on parts though some components can have warranty for longer terms.
897077_14_ITEM15_P84_S0	Warranty reserve, as a percentage of sales, is generally calculated by looking at the current twelve months expenses and prorating that amount based on twelve months sales with a ninety -day to six -month lag period.
897077_14_ITEM15_P84_S1	The Company s historical experience is that an end-user takes approximately 90 days to six months from the receipt of the unit to file a warranty claim.
897077_14_ITEM15_P84_S2	A warranty reserve is established for each different marketing group.
897077_14_ITEM15_P84_S3	Reserve balances are evaluated on a quarterly basis and adjustments made when required.
897077_14_ITEM15_P85_S0	The current liability warranty reserve balance was $ 4,994,000 on December 31, 2013 and $ 5,007,000 on December 31, 2012 .

897077_14_ITEM15_P95_S1	Since the Company s debt is not quoted, estimates are based on each obligation s characteristics, including remaining maturities, interest rate, credit rating, collateral, amortization schedule and liquidity.
897077_14_ITEM15_P95_S2	The carrying amount approximates fair value.
897077_14_ITEM15_P96_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
897077_14_ITEM15_P97_S0	There is a three-tier fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs used in valuation techniques.
897077_14_ITEM15_P98_S0	while unobservable inputs (lowest level) reflect internally developed market assumptions.
897077_14_ITEM15_P98_S1	In fair value measurements are classified under the following hierarchy:
897077_14_ITEM15_P99_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
897077_14_ITEM15_P99_S1	Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs or significant value-drivers are observable in active markets.
897077_14_ITEM15_P100_S0	The Company uses quoted market prices, when available, to determine fair value, and the Company classifies such measurements within Level 1.
897077_14_ITEM15_P100_S1	In some cases where market prices are not available, the Company makes use of observable market-based inputs to calculate fair value, in which case the measurements are classified with Level 2.
897077_14_ITEM15_P101_S0	If quoted or observable market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that use, where possible, current market-based parameters such as interest rates, yield curves, currency rates, etc.
897077_14_ITEM15_P101_S1	These measurements are classified within Level 3.
897077_14_ITEM15_P102_S0	Fair value measurements are classified to the lowest level input or value-driver that is significant to the valuation.
897077_14_ITEM15_P102_S1	A measurement may therefore be classified within Level 3 even though there may be significant inputs that are readily observable.

897077_14_ITEM15_P107_S2	The Company also has state net operating loss carryforwards in the U.S. of approximately $5.0 million which will expire between 2014 to 2028.
897077_14_ITEM15_P108_S0	The company recorded a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 due to uncertainties related to the ability to utilize some of the deferred income tax assets, primarily consisting of certain U.S. state NOLs and income tax credits, and international NOLs, before they expire.
897077_14_ITEM15_P108_S1	The valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which deferred income tax assets will be recoverable.
897077_14_ITEM15_P108_S2	The realization of net deferred income tax assets recorded as of December 31, 2013 is primarily dependent upon the ability to generate future taxable income in certain U.S. states and international jurisdictions.

897077_14_ITEM15_P138_S3	The long-term portfolio return is established via a building block approach with proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing.
897077_14_ITEM15_P138_S4	Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness.
897077_14_ITEM15_P139_S0	The following tables present the components of net periodic benefit cost (gains are denoted with parentheses and losses are not):
897077_14_ITEM15_P140_S0	The Company estimates that $ 132,000 of unrecognized actuarial expense will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit costs during 2014 .
897077_14_ITEM15_P141_S0	The Company employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk.
897077_14_ITEM15_P141_S1	Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condition.
897077_14_ITEM15_P142_S0	The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income investments.
897077_14_ITEM15_P142_S1	Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks, as well as growth, value, and small and large capitalizations.
897077_14_ITEM15_P142_S2	Other assets such as real estate, private equity, and hedge funds are used judiciously to enhance long-term returns while improving portfolio diversification.
897077_14_ITEM15_P142_S3	Derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely manner; however, derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of the underlying investments.
897077_14_ITEM15_P143_S0	Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements, and periodic asset/liability studies.
897077_14_ITEM15_P144_S0	The pension plans' weighted-average asset allocations as a percentage of plan assets at December 31 are as follows:
897077_14_ITEM15_P145_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , we used the following valuation techniques to measure fair value for assets.
897077_14_ITEM15_P145_S1	There were no changes to these methodologies during 2013 :
897077_14_ITEM15_P146_S0	Level 1 - Assets were valued using the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual security was traded.
897077_14_ITEM15_P146_S1	Level 2 - Assets were valued using quoted prices in markets that are not active, broker dealer quotations, net asset value of shares held by the plans, and other methods by which all significant input were observable at the measurement date.
897077_14_ITEM15_P146_S2	Level 3 - Assets were valued using valuation reports from the respective institutions at the measurement date.
897077_14_ITEM15_P146_S3	The following table presents the hierarchy levels for our postretirement benefit plan investments as of December 31:
897077_14_ITEM15_P147_S0	Our interests in the common collective trust investments are managed by one custodian.
897077_14_ITEM15_P147_S1	Consistent with our investment policy, the custodian has invested the assets across a widely diversified portfolio of U.S. and international equity and fixed income securities.
897077_14_ITEM15_P147_S2	Fair values of each security within the collective trust as of December 31, 2013 were obtained from the custodian and are based on quoted market prices of individual investments; however, since the fund itself does not have immediate liquidity or a quoted market price, these assets are considered Level 2.
897077_14_ITEM15_P148_S0	The common collective funds noted in the above table have estimated fair value using the net asset value per share of investments.
897077_14_ITEM15_P148_S1	Investments can be redeemed immediately at the current net asset value per share based on the fair value of the underlying assets.
897077_14_ITEM15_P149_S0	The categories contain investments in equity securities of smaller growing companies, medium-sized U.S. companies, large value-oriented and growth-oriented companies and foreign companies traded on international markets.
897077_14_ITEM15_P150_S0	Expected benefit payments are estimated using the same assumptions used in determining our benefit obligation as of December 31, 2013 .
897077_14_ITEM15_P150_S1	The following table illustrates the estimated pension benefit payments which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, that are projected to be paid:

897077_14_ITEM15_P152_S0	The SERP is intended to provide a benefit from the Company upon retirement, death or disability, or a change in control of the Company.
897077_14_ITEM15_P152_S1	Accordingly, the SERP obligates the Company to pay to a participant a Retirement Benefit (as defined in the SERP) upon the occurrence of certain payment events to the extent a participant has a vested right thereto.
897077_14_ITEM15_P152_S2	A participant s right to his or her Retirement Benefit becomes vested in the Company s contributions upon 10 years of Credited Service (as defined in the SERP) or a change in control of the Company.
897077_14_ITEM15_P152_S3	The Retirement Benefit is based on 20% of the final three -year average salary of each participant on or after his or her normal retirement age ( 65 years of age).
897077_14_ITEM15_P152_S4	In the event of the participant s death or a change in control, the participant s vested retirement benefit will be paid in a lump sum to the participant or his or her estate, as applicable, within 90 days after the participant s death or a change in control, as applicable.
897077_14_ITEM15_P152_S5	In the event the participant is entitled to a benefit from the SERP due to disability, retirement or other termination of employment, the benefit will be paid in monthly installments over a period of fifteen years.
897077_14_ITEM15_P153_S0	The Company records amounts relating to the SERP based on calculations that incorporate various actuarial and other assumptions, including discount rates, rate of compensation increases, retirement dates and life expectancies.
897077_14_ITEM15_P153_S1	The net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn the SERP benefits.
897077_14_ITEM15_P154_S0	In connection with the initiation of the SERP, the Company had an unfunded long-term liability of $1,964,301 , a deferred tax asset of $746,000 and $1,218,301 in accumulated other comprehensive income.
897077_14_ITEM15_P154_S1	The $1,964,301 includes prior service cost which will be amortized over the average remaining service periods of the employees.

897077_14_ITEM15_P174_S1	These laws and regulations are constantly changing, and it is impossible to predict with accuracy the effect that changes to such laws and regulations may have on the Company in the future.
897077_14_ITEM15_P175_S0	Like other industrial concerns, the Company s manufacturing operations entail the risk of noncompliance, and there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur material costs or other liabilities as a result thereof.

897077_15_ITEM1_P77_S0	While the Company believes that the end-users of its products evaluate their purchases on the basis of price, reputation and product quality, such purchases are also based on a dealer s service, support of and loyalty to the dealer based on previous purchase experiences, as well as other factors such as product and replacement part availability.

897077_15_ITEM1_P80_S0	The Company s sales, both product and replacement parts, are generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year, because a substantial number of the Company s products are used for maintenance activities such as vegetation maintenance, highway right-of-way maintenance, construction, and street and parking lot sweeping.

897077_15_ITEM1_P82_S1	The principal competitive factors are price, quality, availability, service and reputation.

897077_15_ITEM1_P82_S3	Some of the Company s competitors are significantly larger than the Company and have substantially greater financial and other resources at their disposal.
897077_15_ITEM1_P82_S4	The Company believes that it is able to compete successfully in its markets by effectively managing its manufacturing costs, offering high quality products, developing and designing innovative products and, to some extent, avoiding direct competition with significantly larger potential competitors.
897077_15_ITEM1_P82_S5	There can be no assurance that the Company s competitors will not substantially increase the resources devoted to the development and marketing of products competitive with the Company s products or that new competitors with greater resources will not enter the Company s markets.

897077_15_ITEM1_P84_S0	The amount of unfilled orders at a particular time is affected by a number of factors, including manufacturing and shipping schedules which, in most instances, are dependent on the Company s seasonal sales programs and the requirements of its customers.
897077_15_ITEM1_P84_S1	Certain of the Company s orders are subject to cancellation at any time before shipment; therefore, a comparison of unfilled orders from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of future actual shipments.

897077_15_ITEM1_P86_S2	No one supplier is responsible for supplying more than 10% of the principal raw materials used by the Company.

897077_15_ITEM1_P89_S2	The net book value of patents and trademarks was $28,916,000 and $5,500,000 as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
897077_15_ITEM1_P89_S3	The increase in 2014 was a result of the Specialized acquisition which increased the net book value of patent and trademarks by $23,416,000 .

897077_15_ITEM1_P93_S2	The Company voluntarily worked with an environmental consultant and the state of Iowa with respect to these issues and believes it completed its remediation program in June 2006.

897077_15_ITEM1_P94_S0	The Company knows that Bush Hog s main manufacturing property in Selma, Alabama was contaminated with chlorinated volatile organic compounds which most likely resulted from painting and cleaning operations during the 1960s and 1970s.
897077_15_ITEM1_P94_S1	The contaminated areas were primarily in the location of underground storage tanks and underneath the former waste storage area.
897077_15_ITEM1_P94_S2	Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, Bush Hog s prior owner agreed to and has removed the underground storage tanks at its cost and has remediated the identified contamination in accordance with the regulations of the Alabama Department of Environmental Management.
897077_15_ITEM1_P94_S3	An environmental consulting firm was retained by the prior owner to administer the cleanup and monitor the site on an ongoing basis until the remediation program is complete and approved by the applicable authorities.

897077_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	You should carefully consider each of the risks described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision with respect to the Company s securities.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the following risks develop into actual events, the Company s business, financial condition or results from operations could be materially and adversely affected and you could lose all or part of your investment.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Deterioration of industry conditions could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our business depends to a large extent upon the prospects for the mowing, right-of-way maintenance and agricultural markets in general.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Future prospects of the industry depend largely on factors outside of our control.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Any of those factors could adversely impact demand for our products, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	increase in unfunded pension plan liability due to financial market deterioration.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In addition, our business is susceptible to a number of factors that specifically affect agricultural customer spending patterns, including the following:
897077_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	A downturn in general economic conditions and outlook in the United States and around the world could adversely affect our net sales and earnings.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The strength and profitability of our business depends on the overall demand for our products and upon economic conditions and outlook, including but not limited to economic growth rates; consumer spending levels; financing availability, pricing and terms for our dealers and end-users; employment rates; interest rates; inflation; consumer confidence and general economic and political conditions and expectations in the United States and the other economies in which we conduct business.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Slow or negative growth rates, inflationary pressures, higher commodity costs and energy prices, reduced credit availability or unfavorable credit terms for our dealers and end-user customers, increased unemployment rates, and continued recessionary economic conditions and outlook could cause consumers to continue to reduce spending, which may cause them to delay or forgo purchases of our products and could have an adverse effect on our net sales and earnings.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We depend on governmental sales and a decrease in such sales could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales to federal, state and local governmental entities and related contractors, both in the U.S. and in other countries in which we sell our products.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	These sales depend primarily on the levels of budgeted and appropriated expenditures for highway, airport, roadside and parks maintenance by various governmental entities and are affected by changes in local and national economic conditions.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our dependence on, and the price and availability of, raw materials as well as purchased components may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We are subject to fluctuations in market prices for raw materials such as steel and energy.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	In addition, although most of the raw materials and purchase components we use are commercially available from a number of sources, we could experience disruptions in the availability of such materials.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If we are unable to purchase materials we require or are unable to pass on price increases to our customers or otherwise reduce our cost of goods sold, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P10_S3	In addition, higher energy costs could negatively affect spending by farmers, including their purchases of our products.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	This analysis requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P12_S2	The cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of time, which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to an even higher degree of uncertainty.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P12_S3	The Company also utilizes market valuation models and other financial ratios, which require the Company to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to its assets and businesses.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , goodwill was $ 72,407,000 , which represents 12% of total assets.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The Company recognized no goodwill impairment in 2014 or 2013.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The Company recognized goodwill impairment at one of its French operations, Faucheux , of $ 656,000 in 2012.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P14_S2	The primary reason for the goodwill impairment in 2012 was the general economic downturn that affected the Company's European operations.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P14_S3	This caused the Company to revise its expectations about future revenue, which is a significant factor in the discounted cash flow analysis used to estimate the fair value of the Company's reporting units.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P14_S4	During the 2014 impairment analysis review, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 15% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit as of December 31, 2014 would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any of the reporting units.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We are significantly dependent on information technology.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic and financial information, to manage a variety of business processes and activities, and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations, personnel, customers, and suppliers.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	These information technology systems, (some of which are provided and maintained by third parties), may be susceptible to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to hardware failures, computer viruses, hacker attacks, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophic events or other factors.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	If our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience business disruptions, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of customers and sales, causing our product sales, financial condition, and operating results to be adversely affected and the reporting of our financial results to be delayed.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	In addition, if we are unable to prevent security breaches or disclosure of non-public information, we may suffer financial and reputational damage, litigation or remediation costs or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners, customers, consumers, or suppliers.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We operate in a highly competitive industry, and some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater resources than we do.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our products are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We compete with several large national and international companies that offer a broad range of equipment and replacement parts that compete with our products, as well as with numerous small, privately-held manufacturers and suppliers of a limited number of products mainly on a regional basis.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Some of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater financial and other resources at their disposal.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P20_S3	We believe that we are able to compete successfully in our markets by, to some extent, avoiding direct competition with significantly larger potential competitors.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P20_S4	There can be no assurance that our competitors will not substantially increase the resources devoted to the development and marketing of products competitive with our products or that new competitors with greater resources will not enter our markets.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Any failure to effectively compete could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We operate and source internationally, which exposes us to the political, economic and other risks of doing business abroad.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We have operations in a number of countries outside of the United States and we source raw materials and components globally.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Our international operations are subject to the risks normally associated with conducting business in foreign countries, including but not limited to the following:
897077_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the United States and the other countries in which we operate affecting foreign trade, investment and taxation.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	In addition, political developments and governmental regulations and policies in the countries in which we operate directly affect the demand for our products.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	For example, decreases or delays in farm subsidies to our agricultural customers, or changes in environmental policies aimed at limiting mowing activities, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our acquisition strategy may not be successful, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We intend to grow internally and through the acquisition of businesses and assets that will complement our current businesses.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	To date, a material portion of our growth has come through acquisitions.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P26_S2	We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition targets, obtain financing for acquisitions on satisfactory terms or successfully acquire identified targets.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Competition for acquisition opportunities may also increase our costs of making acquisitions or prevent us from making certain acquisitions.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P26_S4	These and other acquisition-related factors may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We may be unable to complete or integrate existing or future acquisitions effectively, and businesses we have acquired, or may acquire in the future, may not perform as expected.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We may not be successful in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations and achieving projected synergies.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	We could face many risks in integrating acquired businesses, including but not limited to the following:
897077_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	we may encounter unanticipated events, circumstances or legal liabilities.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts from the management of each entity, including coordinating existing business plans and research and development efforts.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Integrating operations may distract management s attention from the day-to-day operation of the combined companies.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Ultimately, our attempts to integrate the operations, technology and personnel of acquired businesses may not be successful.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P30_S3	If we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses, our future results may be negatively impacted.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	In addition, we may be adversely affected if businesses that we have acquired, or that we acquire in the future, do not perform as expected.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P31_S1	An acquired business could perform below our expectations for a number of reasons, including legislative or regulatory changes that affect the areas in which the acquired business specializes, the loss of customers and dealers, general economic factors that directly affect the acquired business, and the cultural incompatibility of its management team.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Any or all of these reasons could adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The agricultural industry and the infrastructure maintenance industry are seasonal and are affected by the weather, and seasonal fluctuations may cause our results of operations and working capital to fluctuate from quarter to quarter.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	In general, agricultural and governmental end-users typically purchase new equipment during the first and second calendar quarters.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Other products such as street sweepers, excavators, snow blowers, front-end loaders and pothole patchers have different seasonal patterns, as do replacement parts in general.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P33_S2	In attempting to achieve efficient utilization of manpower and facilities throughout the year, we estimate seasonal demand months in advance and manufacturing capacity is scheduled in anticipation of such demand.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P33_S3	We utilize an annual plan with updated quarterly sales forecasts provided by our marketing divisions and order backlog in order to develop a production plan for our manufacturing facilities.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P33_S4	In addition, many of our marketing departments attempt to equalize demand for their products throughout the calendar year by offering seasonal sales programs which may provide additional incentives, including discounts and extended payment terms, on equipment that is ordered during off-season periods.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P33_S5	Because we spread our production and wholesale shipments throughout the year to take into account the factors described above, sales in any given period may not reflect the timing of dealer orders and retail demand.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Weather conditions and general economic conditions may affect the timing of purchases and actual industry conditions might differ from our forecasts.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Consequently, sudden or significant declines in industry demand could adversely affect our working capital or results of operations.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	If we do not retain key personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees, our business may suffer.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our continued success will depend on, among other things, the efforts and skills of our executive officers, including our president and chief executive officer, and our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified managerial, technical, manufacturing, and sales and marketing personnel.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P36_S1	We do not maintain key man life insurance for any of our employees, and all of our senior management are employed at will.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P36_S2	We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and hire suitable replacements for any of our key employees.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P36_S3	We believe the loss of a key executive officer or other key employee could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We may not be able to realize the potential or strategic benefits of the acquisitions we complete, or we may not be able to successfully address problems encountered in connection with acquisitions.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Acquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P38_S1	We have completed a number of acquisitions over the past several years.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P38_S2	We recently consummated three acquisitions in 2014; our acquisition of Fieldquip in Australia in April 2014; our acquisition of Kellands in the U.K., also in April 2014; and our acquisition of Specialized Industries in the U.S. in May 2014.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P38_S3	We expect to consider opportunities and make additional acquisitions in the future, but we may not find suitable acquisition targets or be able to consummate desired acquisitions due to among other things, unfavorable credit markets or other risks, which could harm our operating results.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Acquisitions can be difficult, time-consuming, and pose a number of risks, including:
897077_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	potential negative impact on our relationships with customers, distributors and vendors.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	If we do not manage these risks, the acquisitions that we complete may have an adverse effect on our business, our results of operations, or financial condition.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Increasingly stringent engine emission regulations could impact our ability to sell certain of our products into the market and appropriately price certain of our products, which could negatively affect our competitive position and financial results.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The EPA has adopted increasingly stringent engine emission regulations, including Tier 4 emission requirements applicable to diesel engines in specified horsepower ranges that are used in some of our products.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Beginning January 1, 2013, such requirements expanded to additional horsepower categories and, accordingly, apply to more of our products.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Although we have developed plans to achieve substantial compliance with Tier 4 diesel engine emission requirements, these plans are subject to many variables including, among others, the ability of our suppliers to provide compliant and suitable engines on a timely basis and our ability to meet our production schedule.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P42_S3	If we are unable to successfully execute such plans, our ability to sell our products into the market may be inhibited, which could adversely affect our competitive position and financial results.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P42_S4	To the extent to which we are unable to implement price increases to fully or partially offset higher engine costs as well as related research, development, engineering, and other expenses to design Tier 4 diesel engine compliant products, and our competitors may implement different strategies with respect to compliance with Tier 4 diesel engine emission requirements, we may experience lower market demand for our products that may, ultimately, adversely affect our profit margins, net sales, and overall financial results.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P42_S5	In addition, as customers' buying patterns change to purchase our products in advance of price increases on compliant products, we have experienced and may continue to experience abnormal fluctuation in sales and our financial results of any one period may not be representative of expected financial results in subsequent periods.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	lower market demand for our products that may, ultimately, adversely affect our net sales, profit margins, and overall financial results.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We are subject on an ongoing basis to the risk of product liability claims and other litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Like other manufacturers, we are subject to various claims, including product liability claims, arising in the ordinary course of business, and we are a party to various legal proceedings that constitute routine litigation incidental to our business.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P45_S1	We may be exposed to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury, property damage, or both.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P45_S2	We cannot assure you that we will not experience any material product liability losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend the Company against such claims.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P45_S3	While we currently have product liability insurance, we cannot assure you that our product liability insurance coverage will be adequate for any liabilities that may ultimately be incurred or that it will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P45_S4	A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage or a requirement to participate in a product recall may have a materially adverse effect on our business.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We are subject to environmental, health and safety and employment laws and regulations and related compliance expenditures and liabilities.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Like other manufacturers, the Company is subject to a broad range of federal, state, local and foreign laws and requirements, including those concerning air emissions, discharges into waterways, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials, as well as the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances at the Company s facilities and offsite disposal locations, workplace safety and equal employment opportunities.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P47_S1	These laws and regulations are constantly changing, and it is impossible to predict with accuracy the effect that changes to such laws and regulations may have on the Company in the future.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Like other industrial concerns, the Company s manufacturing operations entail the risk of noncompliance, and there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur material costs or other liabilities as a result thereof.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The Company knows that its Indianola, Iowa property is contaminated with chromium which most likely resulted from chrome plating operations which were discontinued before the Company purchased the property.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Chlorinated volatile organic compounds have also been detected in water samples on the property, though the source is unknown at this time.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P49_S2	The Company voluntarily worked with an environmental consultant and the state of Iowa with respect to these issues and believes it completed its remediation program in June 2006.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P49_S3	The work was accomplished within the Company s environmental liability reserve balance.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P49_S4	We requested a no further action classification from the state.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P49_S5	We received a conditional no further action letter in January of 2009.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P49_S6	When we demonstrate stable or improving conditions below residential standards for a certain period of time by monitoring existing wells, we will request an unconditional no further action letter.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P50_S0	The Company knows that Bush Hog s main manufacturing property in Selma, Alabama was contaminated with chlorinated volatile organic compounds which most likely resulted from painting and cleaning operations during the 1960s and 1970s.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P50_S1	The contaminated areas were primarily in the location of underground storage tanks and underneath the former waste storage area.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, Bush Hog s prior owner agreed to and has removed the underground storage tanks at its cost and has remediated the identified contamination in accordance with the regulations of the Alabama Department of Environmental Management.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P50_S3	An environmental consulting firm was retained by the prior owner to administer the cleanup and monitor the site on an ongoing basis until the remediation program is complete and approved by the applicable authorities.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Certain properties of the Company contain asbestos that may have to be remediated over time and it could be additional expense to the Company.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P52_S0	The Company is subject to various other federal, state, and local laws affecting its business, as well as a variety of regulations relating to such matters as working conditions, equal employment opportunities, and product safety.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P52_S1	A variety of state laws regulate the Company s contractual relationships with its dealers, some of which impose restrictive standards on the relationship between the Company and its dealers, including events of default, grounds for termination, non-renewal of dealer contracts, and equipment repurchase requirements.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P53_S0	If we are unable to comply with the terms of our credit arrangements, especially the financial covenants, our credit arrangements could be terminated.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all of the terms of our credit arrangements, especially the financial covenants.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Our ability to comply with such terms depends on the success of our business and our operating results.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Various risks, uncertainties, and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with the terms of our credit arrangements.
897077_15_ITEM1A_P54_S3	If we were out of compliance with any covenant required by our credit arrangements following any applicable cure periods, the banks could terminate their commitments unless we could negotiate a covenant waiver.

897077_15_ITEM7_P2_S2	Also, improved sales in the Company's North American Industrial Division, which was up 10.3%, excluding the impact of the acquisition of the Specialized business units, was a contributing factor.
897077_15_ITEM7_P2_S3	Agricultural Division sales excluding the acquisitions of Fieldquip and Superior were down 4.2% for 2014 mainly from declining crop prices, a weak overall agricultural market and adverse weather conditions throughout 2014.

897077_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	The increase was primarily from higher sales of sweepers, excavators, vacuum trucks and snow equipment as demand for infrastructure maintenance equipment was strong for most of 2013.
897077_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	North American Agricultural sales (net) were $219,354,000 in 2013 compared to $203,945,000 in 2012, representing an increase of $15,409,000 or 7.6%.
897077_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	The increase in sales compared to 2012 was from improved demand for Bush Hog , Schulte and Rhino products in the agricultural market in North America.
897077_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	Favorable weather conditions during the middle of 2013 helped improve sales to both row crop and hobby farmers.

897077_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	European sales (net) increased $297,000 or 0.2% to $164,879,000 in 2013 compared to $164,582,000 in 2012.
897077_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	This slight increase was mainly from improved sales during the last half of 2013 as European markets showed some signs of improvement after being in decline for the last several years.
897077_15_ITEM7_P16_S2	However, challenging market conditions and uncertainty in the European economy continued to affect this Division.

897077_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	The increase was from higher sales volume during 2013 which led to favorable production efficiencies.
897077_15_ITEM7_P17_S2	Increased lower margin tractor and chassis sales combined with lower sales of higher margin replacement parts negatively affecting the gross profit in 2013.
897077_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG A ) were $107,773,000 (15.9% of net sales) in 2013 compared to $97,507,000 (15.5% of net sales) in 2012.
897077_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	The increase of $10,266,000 in SG A in 2013 was primarily litigation expenses from a patent infringement lawsuit, which we were successful in defending, in the amount of $2,137,000; $972,000 of acquisition related expenses; and $586,000 of additional stock option expense related to the accelerated vesting of options to retirement eligible recipients.
897077_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	Also during 2013, the Company had restructuring costs at one of its French operations, higher performance based incentive compensation expense, increased sales commissions on higher sales, and increased trade show expenses in both North America and Europe.
897077_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	Interest expense for 2013 was $1,161,000 compared to $1,620,000 in 2012, a decrease of $459,000 or 28.3%.
897077_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	The decrease came from reduced borrowings in 2013 compared to 2012.
897077_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	Other income (expense), net was income of $1,626,000 during 2013 compared to an expense of $517,000 in 2012.
897077_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	The income in 2013 included a grant of $475,000 from the UK government related to R D training and employment, a $70,000 gain realized from the sale of the Company's Memphis warehouse in the first quarter of 2013, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
897077_15_ITEM7_P20_S2	the expense was entirely the result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
897077_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	Provision for income taxes was $15,294,000 (29.8% of income before income taxes) for 2013 compared to $14,543,000 (33.5% of income before income taxes) in 2012.
897077_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	Due to the delay in signing the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 which extended the research and development tax credits, the Company was not able to include $350,000 of tax credits in its 2012 financial statements but instead recognized this tax benefit in the first quarter of 2013.
897077_15_ITEM7_P21_S2	Also included in the 2013 provision is a credit related to the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions and a tax benefit relating to current losses in one of our French companies.
897077_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	Net Income for 2013 was $36,094,000 compared to $28,903,000 in 2012 due to the factors described above.
897077_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	In addition to normal operating expenses, the Company has ongoing cash requirements which are necessary to conduct the Company s business, including inventory purchases and capital expenditures.
897077_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	The Company s inventory and accounts payable levels, particularly in its North American Agricultural Division, build in the first quarter and early spring and, to a lesser extent, in the fourth quarter in anticipation of the spring and fall selling seasons.
897077_15_ITEM7_P23_S2	Accounts receivable historically build in the first and fourth quarters of each year as a result of pre-season sales.
897077_15_ITEM7_P23_S3	These sales help balance the Company s production during the first and fourth quarters.
897077_15_ITEM7_P23_S4	Some of the Company s recent acquisitions which are not involved in vegetation maintenance have helped to soften this seasonality pattern.
897077_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , the Company had working capital of $ 303,935,000 , which represents an increase of $ 47,603,000 from working capital of $ 256,332,000 as of December 31, 2013 .

897077_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	Net cash provided by operating activities was $ 30,210,000 for 2014 , compared to $ 31,627,000 for 2013 .
897077_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	The decrease of cash from operating activities was from increases in inventory and rental equipment levels mainly from the acquisition of the Specialized.
897077_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	Net cash used in investing activities was $204,831,000 for 2014 , compared to $14,166,000 for 2013 .

897077_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	Effective May 12, 2014, the Company amended its revolving credit facility and increased its line of credit from $100 million to $250 million to accommodate the acquisition of the Specialized business units and meet the ongoing needs of the combined entities.
897077_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	The Company maintains a revolving credit facility with certain lenders under its Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement.
897077_15_ITEM7_P34_S1	The aggregate commitments from lenders under such revolving credit facility are $250,000,000 and, subject to certain conditions, the Company has the option to request an increase in aggregate commitments of up to an additional $50,000,000 .
897077_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	The revolving credit agreement requires us to maintain various financial covenants including a minimum earnings before interest and tax to interest expense ratio, a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum asset coverage ratio.

897077_15_ITEM7_P35_S6	On December 31, 2014 , $1,090,000 of the revolver capacity was committed to irrevocable standby letters of credit issued in the ordinary course of business as required by vendors' contracts resulting in $58,910,000 in available borrowings.
897077_15_ITEM7_P35_S7	As of December 31, 2014 , the Company is in compliance with the terms and conditions of its credit facilities.
897077_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	Management believes the bank credit facility and the Company s ability to internally generate funds from operations should be sufficient to meet the Company s cash requirements for the foreseeable future.
897077_15_ITEM7_P36_S1	However, challenges affecting the banking industry and credit markets in general can potentially cause changes to credit availability, which creates a level of uncertainty.
897077_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	The Company believes that inflation generally has not had a material impact on its operations or liquidity.
897077_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	The Company is exposed to the risk that the price of energy, steel and other purchased components may increase and the Company may not be able to increase the price of its products correspondingly.
897077_15_ITEM7_P37_S2	If this occurs, the Company s results of operations would be adversely impacted.
897077_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	The SEC adopted the conflict mineral rules under Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act on August 22, 2012.
897077_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	The rules require public companies to disclose information about their use of specific minerals originating from and financing armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries.
897077_15_ITEM7_P38_S2	The conflict mineral rules cover minerals frequently used to manufacture a wide array of electronic and industrial products including semiconductor devices.
897077_15_ITEM7_P38_S3	The rules do not ban the use of minerals from conflict sources, but require SEC filings and public disclosure covering the calendar year 2014, though the public disclosure provision is being challenged in court.
897077_15_ITEM7_P38_S4	We have determined that we are subject to the rules and are evaluating our supply chain, developed processes to assess the impacts and file the required document before the May 2015 deadline.
897077_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	In April 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposal of Components of an Entity, which raises the threshold for disposals to qualify as discontinued operations by focusing on whether a disposal represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an company s operations and financial results.
897077_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	The guidance allows companies to have significant continuing involvement and continuing cash flows with the disposed component.
897077_15_ITEM7_P39_S2	The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014 and is to be applied on a prospective basis.
897077_15_ITEM7_P39_S3	The Company will apply the new standard to any divestitures occurring after December 31, 2014.
897077_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance.
897077_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
897077_15_ITEM7_P40_S2	The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract.
897077_15_ITEM7_P40_S3	The amendments in the ASU must be applied using either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method and are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
897077_15_ITEM7_P40_S4	We will evaluate the effects, if any, that adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.
897077_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)," effective for annual periods and interim periods within those periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
897077_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	The amendments require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition.
897077_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	The Company is currently evaluating to determine the potential impact, if any, that the adoption of ASU 2014-12 will have on its financial position and results of operations.
897077_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	The Company does not have any obligation, under any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the Company is a party, that has or is reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources, that is material to investors.
897077_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	The following table shows the Company s approximate obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014 :
897077_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	Definitions: (A) Long-term debt obligation means a principal payment obligation under long-term borrowings.
897077_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	(B) Capital lease obligation means a principal payment obligation under a lease classified as a capital lease.
897077_15_ITEM7_P45_S2	(C) Interest obligation represents interest due on long-term debt and capital lease obligations.
897077_15_ITEM7_P45_S3	Interest on long-term debt assumes all floating rates of interest remain the same as those in effect at December 31, 2014 .
897077_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	(D) Operating lease obligation means a payment obligation under a lease classified as an operating lease.
897077_15_ITEM7_P46_S1	(E) Purchase obligation means an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the registrant that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions.
897077_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	Critical Accounting Estimates Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ).
897077_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
897077_15_ITEM7_P47_S2	Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
897077_15_ITEM7_P47_S3	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
897077_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the financial statements.
897077_15_ITEM7_P48_S1	Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
897077_15_ITEM7_P48_S2	For further information on the critical accounting policies, see Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
897077_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	In the last ten years, we have acquired 14 businesses.
897077_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	The purchase prices of acquired businesses have been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based upon their estimated fair value at the date of purchase.
897077_15_ITEM7_P49_S2	The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
897077_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	Most of the businesses we have acquired did not have a significant amount of intangible assets.
897077_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	With the 2014 acquisition of Specialized we acquired a significant amount of intangible assets.
897077_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	intangible assets in the acquisition: trade name and trademarks, customer and dealer relationships, and patents, technology and drawings.
897077_15_ITEM7_P51_S1	We completed the fair value analysis of the acquired assets in the fourth quarter of 2014.
897077_15_ITEM7_P51_S2	In valuing certain acquired intangible assets, we used an excess earnings and relief from royalty methodologies, which are forms of discounted cash flow analysis.
897077_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	Tangible assets are typically valued using a replacement or reproduction cost approach, considering factors such as current prices of the same or similar equipment, the age of the equipment, and economic obsolescence.
897077_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	In making other assumptions on valuation and useful lives, we considered the unique nature of the acquisition and we utilized a third-party valuation firm to assist us in the valuation of the acquired intangibles and the resulting allocation of purchase price for the acquisition.
897077_15_ITEM7_P53_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , we had $51,484,000 in intangible assets (net of accumulated amortization) and $41,159,000 in goodwill directly attributable to the Specialized acquisition.
897077_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	The Company evaluates the collectability of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors.
897077_15_ITEM7_P54_S1	In circumstances where it is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations, the Company records a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what it believes will be collected.
897077_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	The Company evaluates all receivables that are over 60 days old and will reserve specifically on a 90-day basis.
897077_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	The Company has a secured or insured interest on most of its wholegoods that each customer purchases.
897077_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	This allows the Company, in times of a difficult economy when the customer is unable to pay or has filed for bankruptcy, to repossess its inventory.
897077_15_ITEM7_P56_S2	This also allows Alamo Group in certain instances, to maintain only a reserve over its cost, which usually represents the margin on the original sales price.
897077_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $ 2,853,000 on December 31, 2014 , and $ 2,738,000 on December 31, 2013 .
897077_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	The increase was primarily from the acquisition of Specialized.
897077_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	On December 31, 2014 , the Company had $ 15,999,000 in reserves for sales discounts compared to $ 16,724,000 on December 31, 2013 on product shipped to our customers under various promotional programs.
897077_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	The decrease was due primarily to lower sales volume of the Company s agricultural products during the 2014 pre-season, which runs during the third and fourth quarters of each year with orders shipped through the second quarter of 2015.
897077_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	The Company reviews the reserve quarterly based on analysis made on each program outstanding at the time.
897077_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	The Company bases its reserves on historical data relating to discounts taken by the customer under each program.
897077_15_ITEM7_P60_S1	Historically, between 85% and 95% of the Company s customers who qualify for each program actually take the discount that is available.
897077_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	The Company had a reserve of $ 7,601,000 on December 31, 2014 and $ 8,596,000 on December 31, 2013 to cover obsolete and slow moving inventory.
897077_15_ITEM7_P61_S1	The decrease in the reserve was mainly from the Company's Agricultural Division.
897077_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	The obsolete and slow moving inventory policy states that the reserve is to be calculated as follows: 1) no inventory usage over a three-year period is deemed obsolete and reserved at 100 percent; and 2) slow moving inventory with little usage requires a 100 percent reserve on items that have a quantity greater than a three-year supply.
897077_15_ITEM7_P62_S1	There are exceptions to the obsolete and slow moving classifications if approved by an officer of the Company, based on specific identification of an item or items that are deemed to be either included or excluded from this classification.
897077_15_ITEM7_P62_S2	In cases where there is no historical data, management makes a judgment based on a specific review of the inventory in question to determine what reserves, if any, are appropriate.
897077_15_ITEM7_P62_S3	New products or parts are generally excluded from the reserve policy until a three-year history has been established.
897077_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	The reserve is reviewed and, if necessary, adjustments are made on a quarterly basis.
897077_15_ITEM7_P63_S1	The Company relies on historical information when available to support its reserve.
897077_15_ITEM7_P63_S2	The Company does not adjust the reserve balance until the inventory is liquidated.
897077_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	The Company s warranty policy is generally to provide its customers warranty for up to one year on all wholegood units and 90 days on parts, though some components can have warranty for longer terms.
897077_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	Warranty reserve, as a percentage of sales, is generally calculated by looking at the current twelve months expenses and prorating that amount based on twelve months sales with a ninety-day to six-month lag period.
897077_15_ITEM7_P65_S1	The Company s historical experience is that an end-user takes approximately 90 days to six months from the receipt of the unit to file a warranty claim.
897077_15_ITEM7_P65_S2	A warranty reserve is established for each different marketing group.
897077_15_ITEM7_P65_S3	Reserve balances are evaluated on a quarterly basis and adjustments made when required.
897077_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	The current liability warranty reserve balance was $ 5,913,000 on December 31, 2014 and $ 4,994,000 on December 31, 2013 .
897077_15_ITEM7_P66_S1	The increase was primarily from the acquisition of Specialized in the amount of $1,006,000.
897077_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	We test goodwill for impairment annually, at the reporting unit level, and whenever events or circumstances make it likely that an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell all or a portion of a reporting unit.
897077_15_ITEM7_P67_S1	We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of December 31 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis.
897077_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	Goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing a qualitative assessment or a two-step process.
897077_15_ITEM7_P68_S1	We have an option to make a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit's goodwill for impairment.
897077_15_ITEM7_P68_S2	If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary.
897077_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	For reporting units where we perform the two-step process, the first step requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill.
897077_15_ITEM7_P69_S1	If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not considered impaired.
897077_15_ITEM7_P69_S2	If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, there is an indication that an impairment may exist and the second step is required.
897077_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	In step two, the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities.
897077_15_ITEM7_P70_S1	If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill, the difference is recognized as an impairment loss.
897077_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis.
897077_15_ITEM7_P71_S1	This analysis requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates.
897077_15_ITEM7_P71_S2	The cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of time, which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to an even higher degree of uncertainty.
897077_15_ITEM7_P71_S3	The Company also utilizes market valuation models and other financial ratios, which require the Company to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to its assets and businesses.
897077_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , goodwill was $ 72,407,000 , which represents 12% of total assets.
897077_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	The Company recognized no goodwill impairment in 2014 or 2013.
897077_15_ITEM7_P73_S1	The Company recognized goodwill impairment at one of its French operations, Faucheux , of $ 656,000 in 2012.
897077_15_ITEM7_P73_S2	The primary reason for the goodwill impairment in 2012 was the general economic downturn that affected the Company's European operations.
897077_15_ITEM7_P73_S3	This caused the Company to revise its expectations about future revenue, which is a significant factor in the discounted cash flow analysis used to estimate the fair value of the Company's reporting units.
897077_15_ITEM7_P73_S4	During the 2014 impairment analysis review, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 15% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit as of December 31, 2014 would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any of the reporting units.
897077_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	Management believes that the estimated valuations it arrived at are reasonable and consistent with what other marketplace participants would use in valuing the Company's components.
897077_15_ITEM7_P74_S1	However, management cannot give any assurance that these market values will not change in the future.
897077_15_ITEM7_P74_S2	For example, if discount rates demanded by the market increase, this could lead to reduced valuations under the income approach.
897077_15_ITEM7_P74_S3	If the Company's projections are not achieved in the future, this could lead management to reassess their assumptions and lead to reduced valuations under the income approach.
897077_15_ITEM7_P74_S4	If the market price of the Company's stock decreases, this could cause the Company to reassess the reasonableness of the implied control premium, which might cause management to assume a higher discount rate under the income approach which could lead to reduced valuations.
897077_15_ITEM7_P74_S5	If future similar transactions exhibit lower multiples than those observed in the past, this could lead to reduced valuations under the similar transactions approach.
897077_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	companies selected as comparable to the Company's components, this could lead to reduced valuations under the public company market multiple approach.
897077_15_ITEM7_P76_S0	The Company's annual impairment test is performed during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.
897077_15_ITEM7_P76_S1	Given the current market conditions and continued economic uncertainty, the fair value of the Company's components could deteriorate, which could result in the need to record impairment charges in future periods.
897077_15_ITEM7_P76_S2	The Company also monitors potential triggering events including changes in the business climate in which it operates, attrition of key personnel, volatility in the capital markets, the Company's market capitalization compared to its book value, the Company's recent operating performance, and the Company's financial projections.
897077_15_ITEM7_P76_S3	The occurrence of one or more triggering events could require additional impairment testing, which could result in future impairment charges.
897077_15_ITEM7_P77_S0	See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding goodwill.
897077_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The Company is exposed to various financial market risks.
897077_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates.
897077_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The Company does not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
897077_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	A portion of the Company s operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities in international jurisdictions.
897077_15_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The Company manufactures its products primarily in the United States, the U.K., France, Canada and Australia.
897077_15_ITEM7A_P2_S2	The Company sells its products primarily within the markets where the products are produced, but certain of the Company s sales from its U.K. and Canadian operations are denominated in other currencies.
897077_15_ITEM7A_P2_S3	As a result, the Company s financials, specifically the value of its foreign assets, could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the other markets in which the subsidiaries of the Company distribute their products.
897077_15_ITEM7A_P3_S0	To mitigate the short-term effect of changes in currency exchange rates on the Company s functional currency-based sales, the Company s U.K. and Canadian subsidiaries regularly enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge over 90% of their future net foreign currency cash receipts over a period of six months.
897077_15_ITEM7A_P3_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , the Company had a notional amount of $ 2,527,000 in outstanding forward exchange contracts related to accounts receivable.
897077_15_ITEM7A_P3_S2	A 15% fluctuation in exchange rates for these currencies would change the fair value by approximately $ 379,000 .
897077_15_ITEM7A_P3_S3	However, since these contracts hedge foreign currency denominated transactions, any change in the fair value of the contracts should be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged.
897077_15_ITEM7A_P4_S0	On December 31, 2014 , the fair value of these agreements was in an unfavorable position; therefore, the derivative financial instruments were recorded as a loss of $43,000 , which has been recognized in other income (expense), net.
897077_15_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The Company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominantly in European countries, Canada and Australia, as a result of the sale of its products in international markets.
897077_15_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the U.K. are used to hedge against the earnings effects of such fluctuations.
897077_15_ITEM7A_P5_S2	On December 31, 2014 , the result of a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies in which the Company s sales are denominated would have been a decrease in gross profit of $ 5,906,000 .
897077_15_ITEM7A_P5_S3	Comparatively, on December 31, 2013 , the result of a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which the Company s sales are denominated would have been a decrease in gross profit of approximately $ 5,475,000 .
897077_15_ITEM7A_P6_S0	This calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar.
897077_15_ITEM7A_P6_S1	In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, which are a changed dollar value of the resulting sales, changes in exchange rates may also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive.
897077_15_ITEM7A_P6_S2	The Company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices.
897077_15_ITEM7A_P7_S0	was a loss of $16,331,000 .
897077_15_ITEM7A_P7_S1	On December 31, 2014 , the British pound closed at 0.6419 relative to the U.S. dollar, and the Euro closed at 0.8265 relative to the U.S. dollar.
897077_15_ITEM7A_P7_S2	By comparison, on December 31, 2013 , the British pound closed at 0.6040 relative to the U.S. dollar, and the Euro closed at 0.7275 relative to the U.S. dollar.
897077_15_ITEM7A_P7_S3	No assurance can be given as to future valuation of the British pound or Euro or how further movements in those or other currencies could affect future earnings or the financial position of the Company.
897077_15_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Interest Rate Risk The majority of the Company s long-term debt bears interest at variable rates.
897077_15_ITEM7A_P8_S1	Accordingly, the Company s net income is affected by changes in interest rates.
897077_15_ITEM7A_P8_S2	Assuming the average level of borrowings at variable rates and a two hundred basis point change in the 2014 average interest rate under these borrowings, the Company s 2014 interest expense would have changed by approximately $ 3,407,000 .
897077_15_ITEM7A_P9_S0	In the event of an adverse change in interest rates, management could take actions to mitigate its exposure.
897077_15_ITEM7A_P9_S1	Further, this analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment.
897077_15_ITEM7A_P9_S2	However, challenges affecting the banking industry and credit markets in general can potentially cause changes to credit availability and cost of borrowing, which creates a level of uncertainty.

897077_15_ITEM15_P11_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
897077_15_ITEM15_P11_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
897077_15_ITEM15_P11_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

897077_15_ITEM15_P11_S4	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
897077_15_ITEM15_P12_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
897077_15_ITEM15_P12_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
897077_15_ITEM15_P13_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
897077_15_ITEM15_P13_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

897077_15_ITEM15_P25_S1	All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
897077_15_ITEM15_P26_S0	Certain reclassifications have been made to 2013 and 2012 to conform to the current presentation.
897077_15_ITEM15_P26_S1	The accompanying statement of income reflects the correction of a misclassification of freight revenue for the periods.
897077_15_ITEM15_P26_S2	Freight allowance given to customers was previously recorded as a reduction of cost of sales and has been reclassified to increase net sales and cost of sales in accordance with ASC 605-45-45-20.
897077_15_ITEM15_P26_S3	The reclassification of net sales and cost of sales for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 resulted in an increase of approximately $5.3 million and $4.6 million , respectively, with no impact on reported net income.
897077_15_ITEM15_P26_S4	These freight allowances for 2014 were $5.5 million .
897077_15_ITEM15_P27_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
897077_15_ITEM15_P27_S1	Judgments related to asset impairment and certain reserves are particularly subject to change.
897077_15_ITEM15_P27_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
897077_15_ITEM15_P28_S0	Foreign Currency The Company translates the assets and liabilities of foreign-owned subsidiaries at rates in effect at the end of the year.
897077_15_ITEM15_P28_S1	Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates in effect during the reporting period.

897077_15_ITEM15_P30_S1	The unrealized loss of the December 31, 2014 contracts that the Company expects to incur during the first quarter of 2015 is approximately $ 27,000 , net of taxes.
897077_15_ITEM15_P31_S0	Foreign currency transaction gains or losses are included in Other income (expense), net.

897077_15_ITEM15_P31_S2	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
897077_15_ITEM15_P31_S3	As of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , there was no restricted cash.
897077_15_ITEM15_P32_S0	Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable.
897077_15_ITEM15_P32_S1	The credit risk is limited because of the large numbers and types of customers and their geographic dispersion.
897077_15_ITEM15_P33_S0	Inventories of U.S. operating subsidiaries are stated at the lower of cost (last-in, first-out method) ( LIFO ) or market, and the Company s international subsidiaries inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) ( FIFO ) or market.
897077_15_ITEM15_P34_S0	Property, plant, and equipment are stated on the basis of cost.
897077_15_ITEM15_P34_S1	Major renewals and betterments are charged to the property accounts while replacements, maintenance and repairs, which do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets, are expensed to the current period.
897077_15_ITEM15_P35_S0	Depreciation is provided at amounts calculated to amortize the cost of the assets over their estimated useful economic lives using the straight-line method.
897077_15_ITEM15_P36_S0	Goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of businesses acquired.
897077_15_ITEM15_P36_S1	We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of December 31 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis.
897077_15_ITEM15_P37_S0	Goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing a qualitative assessment or a two-step process.
897077_15_ITEM15_P37_S1	We have an option to make a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit's goodwill for impairment.
897077_15_ITEM15_P37_S2	If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary.
897077_15_ITEM15_P38_S0	For reporting units where we perform the two-step process, the first step requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill.
897077_15_ITEM15_P38_S1	If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not considered impaired.
897077_15_ITEM15_P38_S2	If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, there is an indication that an impairment may exist and the second step is required.
897077_15_ITEM15_P39_S0	In step two, the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities.
897077_15_ITEM15_P39_S1	If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill, the difference is recognized as an impairment loss.
897077_15_ITEM15_P40_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis.
897077_15_ITEM15_P40_S1	This analysis requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates.
897077_15_ITEM15_P40_S2	The cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of time, which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to an even higher degree of uncertainty.
897077_15_ITEM15_P40_S3	The Company also utilizes market valuation models and other financial ratios, which require the Company to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to its assets and businesses.
897077_15_ITEM15_P41_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , goodwill was $ 72,407,000 , which represents 12% of total assets.
897077_15_ITEM15_P42_S0	The Company recognized no goodwill impairment in 2014 or 2013.
897077_15_ITEM15_P42_S1	The Company recognized goodwill impairment at one of its French operations, Faucheux , of $ 656,000 in 2012.
897077_15_ITEM15_P42_S2	The primary reason for the goodwill impairment in 2012 was the general economic downturn that affected the Company's European operations.
897077_15_ITEM15_P42_S3	This caused the Company to revise its expectations about future revenue, which is a significant factor in the discounted cash flow analysis used to estimate the fair value of the Company's reporting units.
897077_15_ITEM15_P42_S4	During the 2014 impairment analysis review, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 15% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit as of December 31, 2014 would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any of the reporting units.
897077_15_ITEM15_P43_S0	Management believes that the estimated valuations it arrived at are reasonable and consistent with what other marketplace participants would use in valuing the Company's components.
897077_15_ITEM15_P43_S1	However, management cannot give any assurance that these market values will not change in the future.
897077_15_ITEM15_P43_S2	For example, if discount rates demanded by the market increase, this could lead to reduced valuations under the income approach.
897077_15_ITEM15_P43_S3	If the Company's projections are not achieved in the future, this could lead management to reassess their assumptions and lead to reduced valuations under the income approach.
897077_15_ITEM15_P44_S0	assume a higher discount rate under the income approach which could lead to reduced valuations.
897077_15_ITEM15_P44_S1	If future similar transactions exhibit lower multiples than those observed in the past, this could lead to reduced valuations under the similar transactions approach.
897077_15_ITEM15_P44_S2	And finally, if there is a general decline in the stock market and particularly in those companies selected as comparable to the Company's components, this could lead to reduced valuations under the public company market multiple approach.
897077_15_ITEM15_P45_S0	The Company's annual impairment test is performed during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.
897077_15_ITEM15_P45_S1	Given the current market conditions and continued economic uncertainty, the fair value of the Company's components could deteriorate which could result in the need to record impairment charges in future periods.
897077_15_ITEM15_P45_S2	The Company also monitors potential triggering events including changes in the business climate in which it operates, attrition of key personnel, volatility in the capital markets, the Company's market capitalization compared to its book value, the Company's recent operating performance, and the Company's financial projections.
897077_15_ITEM15_P45_S3	The occurrence of one or more triggering events could require additional impairment testing, which could result in future impairment charges.
897077_15_ITEM15_P46_S0	See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding goodwill.
897077_15_ITEM15_P47_S0	The Company has intangible assets with both definite and indefinite useful lives.
897077_15_ITEM15_P47_S1	The definite-lived assets are trade names and trademarks, customer and dealer relationships, and patents and drawings that are subject to amortization with useful lives ranging from 12 years to 25 years.
897077_15_ITEM15_P47_S2	The net book value of these assets at December 31, 2014 was $51,484,000 and zero at December 31, 2013 .
897077_15_ITEM15_P48_S0	The indefinite-lived assets not subject to amortization consist of trade names.
897077_15_ITEM15_P48_S1	The net book value of these trade names was $5,500,000 as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 .
897077_15_ITEM15_P48_S2	This consisted of the Gradall trade name with a carrying value of $3,600,000 and the Bush Hog trade name with a carrying value of $1,900,000 .
897077_15_ITEM15_P49_S0	The Company will tests its indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis at year-end, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset could be below its carrying amount.
897077_15_ITEM15_P49_S1	The impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, determined using the relief from royalty method, with its carrying amount.
897077_15_ITEM15_P49_S2	An impairment loss would be recognized for the carrying amount in excess of its fair value.
897077_15_ITEM15_P50_S0	In connection with the February 3, 2006 purchase of all the net assets of the Gradall excavator business, the Company assumed sponsorship of two Gradall non-contributory defined benefit pension plans, both of which were frozen with respect to both future benefit accruals and future new entrants.
897077_15_ITEM15_P51_S0	The Gradall Company Hourly Employees Pension Plan covers approximately 331 former employees and 125 current employees who (i) were formerly employed by JLG Industries, Inc., (ii) were covered by a collective bargaining agreement and (iii) first participated in the plan before April 6, 1997.
897077_15_ITEM15_P51_S1	An amendment ceasing all future benefit accruals was effective April 6, 1997.
897077_15_ITEM15_P52_S0	The Gradall Company Employees Retirement Plan covers approximately 238 former employees and 83 current employees who (i) were formerly employed by JLG Industries, Inc., (ii) were not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and (iii) first participated in the plan before December 31, 2004.
897077_15_ITEM15_P52_S1	An amendment ceasing future benefit accruals for certain participants was effective December 31, 2004.
897077_15_ITEM15_P52_S2	A second amendment discontinued all future benefit accruals for all participants effective April 24, 2006.
897077_15_ITEM15_P53_S0	The Company recognizes the funded status of the defined benefit pension plans as a liability in its statement of financial position and recognizes any changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through other comprehensive income (loss).
897077_15_ITEM15_P54_S0	There were no reportable relationships or related party transactions for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
897077_15_ITEM15_P55_S0	The Company recognizes revenue when each of the following four criteria are met: 1) a contract or sales arrangement exists; 2) products have been shipped per agreed terms and title has been transferred or services have been rendered; 3) the prices of the products or services are fixed or determinable; and 4) collectability is reasonably assured.
897077_15_ITEM15_P56_S0	Pre-season sales orders are solicited in the fall in advance of the dealer s sales season in the spring and summer.
897077_15_ITEM15_P56_S1	Pre-season sales orders are shipped beginning in the fall and continuing through the spring and represent an opportunity for the Company s factories to level their production/shipping volumes through the winter months.
897077_15_ITEM15_P56_S2	These pre-season shipments carry descending discounts in conjunction with delayed payment terms of up to six months from the dealer s requested delivery date.
897077_15_ITEM15_P57_S0	Revenue from sales is recorded net of a provision for discounts that are anticipated to be earned and deducted at time of payment by the customer.
897077_15_ITEM15_P57_S1	These approximated discounts are estimated using an average of historical discounts taken and are adjusted as program terms are changed.
897077_15_ITEM15_P57_S2	The reserves for discounts are reviewed and adjusted quarterly.
897077_15_ITEM15_P57_S3	From time to time, revenue is recognized under a bill and hold arrangement.
897077_15_ITEM15_P57_S4	Revenue recognized under bill and hold arrangements for 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 was immaterial.
897077_15_ITEM15_P58_S0	The Company enters into lease agreements with customers related to the rental of certain equipment.
897077_15_ITEM15_P58_S1	All of these leasing agreements are classified as operating leases, and are for periods not to exceed two years.
897077_15_ITEM15_P58_S2	In accounting for these leases, the cost of the equipment purchased or manufactured by the Company is recorded as an asset, and is depreciated over its estimated useful life.
897077_15_ITEM15_P58_S3	Accumulated depreciation relating to the rental equipment was $3,435,000 as of December 31, 2014 .
897077_15_ITEM15_P58_S4	The rental income is recognized ratably over the term of the leases.
897077_15_ITEM15_P59_S0	The Company capitalizes certain costs associated with the development and installation of internal use software.
897077_15_ITEM15_P59_S1	Internal use software costs are expensed or capitalized depending on whether they are incurred in the preliminary project stage, application development stage or the post-implementation stage.
897077_15_ITEM15_P59_S2	Amounts capitalized are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software.
897077_15_ITEM15_P60_S0	The book value of capitalized software net of amortization was approximately $ 1,370,000 and $ 944,000 on December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , respectively.
897077_15_ITEM15_P60_S1	Software amortization expense was $ 556,000 , $ 488,000 and $ 676,000 in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.

897077_15_ITEM15_P65_S0	The Company s policy is to accrue for legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with loss contingencies.
897077_15_ITEM15_P66_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and are measured by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to the future years in which deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized.
897077_15_ITEM15_P67_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.
897077_15_ITEM15_P67_S1	The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.
897077_15_ITEM15_P67_S2	Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, available tax carrybacks and tax planning strategies in making this assessment other than those which we have reserved.
897077_15_ITEM15_P67_S3	Based upon projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences.
897077_15_ITEM15_P68_S0	We do not provide for a U.S. income tax liability on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.
897077_15_ITEM15_P68_S1	The earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, which reflect full provision for non-U.S. income taxes, are currently indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. operations.
897077_15_ITEM15_P69_S0	The Company has granted options to purchase its common stock to certain employees and directors of the Company and its affiliates under various stock option plans at no less than the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant.
897077_15_ITEM15_P69_S1	These options are granted for a term not exceeding ten years and are forfeited in the event the employee or director terminates his or her employment or relationship with the Company or one of its affiliates other than by retirement or death.
897077_15_ITEM15_P69_S2	These options generally vest over five years.
897077_15_ITEM15_P70_S0	All option plans contain anti-dilutive provisions that permit an adjustment of the number of shares of the Company s common stock represented by each option for any change in capitalization.
897077_15_ITEM15_P71_S0	The fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation method with the following assumptions noted:
897077_15_ITEM15_P72_S0	The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rate over the expected life of the option at the time of the grant.
897077_15_ITEM15_P73_S0	The dividend yield is calculated as the ratio of dividends paid per share of common stock to the stock price on the date of the grant.
897077_15_ITEM15_P73_S1	The expected volatility factors are based on the historical movement of the Company s common stock price over the expected life of the option.
897077_15_ITEM15_P73_S2	The expected life is the average length of time in which officers, other employees, and non-employee directors are expected to exercise their options, and which are primarily based on historical experience.
897077_15_ITEM15_P74_S0	The Company calculated the fair value for options with the following weighted-average assumptions for 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 :
897077_15_ITEM15_P75_S0	The carrying values of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses, approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these items.
897077_15_ITEM15_P75_S1	The carrying value of our debt approximates the fair value as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , as the floating rates on our outstanding balances approximate current market rates.
897077_15_ITEM15_P76_S0	This conclusion was made based on Level 2 inputs.
897077_15_ITEM15_P77_S0	On May 13, 2014 the "Closing Date", the Company acquired all of the operating units of Specialized Industries LP, a portfolio company of ELB Capital Management, LLC.
897077_15_ITEM15_P77_S1	P. Fairfield LLC as well as several related entities ("Specialized"), including all brand names and related product names and trademarks (the "Acquisition") pursuant to the terms of the Membership Interests and Partnership Interests Purchase Agreement dated February 24, 2014 (the Agreement ).
897077_15_ITEM15_P77_S2	The purchase price consideration was $193 million , on a debt-free basis which included certain post-closing adjustments that were made within 90 days from the Acquisition date per the agreement.
897077_15_ITEM15_P78_S0	In connection with the Acquisition on May 13, 2014, Alamo Group amended its revolving credit facility and increased its line of credit from $100 million to $250 million .
897077_15_ITEM15_P78_S1	Alamo Group financed the Acquisition through $190 million of new borrowings under the amended credit facility.
897077_15_ITEM15_P79_S0	The Acquisition was accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 805 Business Combinations ( ASC Topic 805 ).
897077_15_ITEM15_P79_S1	Accordingly, the total purchase price has been allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the Acquisition, based on their fair values as of May 12, 2014.
897077_15_ITEM15_P80_S0	The primary reason for the Specialized acquisition was to broaden the Company's existing equipment lines.
897077_15_ITEM15_P80_S1	This acquisition broadens our product offering and enhances our market position both in vacuum trucks and snow removal equipment.
897077_15_ITEM15_P81_S0	The Company completed its evaluation of the purchase price allocation during the fourth quarter of 2014, which included the fair value of accounts receivable, inventory, rental equipment, property, plant and equipment, intangibles, accrued liabilities and deferred taxes.
897077_15_ITEM15_P81_S1	This required the Company to adjust the recorded goodwill.
897077_15_ITEM15_P82_S0	The following table summarizes the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the Acquisition date (in thousands):
897077_15_ITEM15_P83_S0	Intangible assets determined to be definite-lived assets and are broken down as follows:
897077_15_ITEM15_P84_S0	The valuation did not identify indefinite-lived assets during the analysis.
897077_15_ITEM15_P85_S0	Other liabilities consisted of Accounts payable of $4.1 million and the remaining amount consisted of various assumed accrued liabilities.
897077_15_ITEM15_P86_S0	This allocation resulted in goodwill of $41.3 million , all of which has been assigned to the Company's Industrial reporting segment.
897077_15_ITEM15_P86_S1	$6.5 million of goodwill is tax deductible the remaining balance is not.
897077_15_ITEM15_P87_S0	The recognized goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies in both the vacuum truck and snow removal product lines.
897077_15_ITEM15_P88_S0	Under ASC Topic 805-10, acquisition related costs (i.e., advisory, legal, valuation and other professional fees) are not included as a component of consideration transferred, but are accounted for as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred.
897077_15_ITEM15_P88_S1	The Company incurred $1.8 million of acquisition related costs, which have been recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of income.
897077_15_ITEM15_P88_S2	The Company will incur integration expenses during 2015 and 2016 relating to manufacturing process changes and computer conversion.
897077_15_ITEM15_P88_S3	They are expected to be immaterial.
897077_15_ITEM15_P89_S0	In the period between the Acquisition Date and December 31, 2014, the Specialized business units generated approximately $107.4 million of net sales and $5.1 million of net income.
897077_15_ITEM15_P89_S1	The Company has included the operating results of Specialized in its consolidated financial statements since the Acquisition Date.
897077_15_ITEM15_P90_S0	The following table presents the unaudited pro forma combined results of operations of the Company and the acquired business units of Specialized as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2013 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.
897077_15_ITEM15_P90_S1	This includes certain pro forma adjustments including: (i) recognition of the costs related to the step-up in fair value of the Specialized inventory, (ii) amortization of acquired intangible assets, (iii) the impact of certain fair value adjustments such as depreciation on the acquired rental equipment and property, plant and equipment, and (iv) interest expense for historical long-term debt of Specialized that was repaid and interest expense on additional borrowings by the Company to fund the acquisition.
897077_15_ITEM15_P90_S2	The unaudited pro forma statement of income of the Company is as follows:
897077_15_ITEM15_P91_S0	The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the consolidated results of operations of the Company that would have been reported had the acquisition been completed as of the beginning of the periods presented, and should not be taken as being representative of the future consolidated results of operations of the Company.
897077_15_ITEM15_P92_S0	The Company also completed two smaller acquisitions during the second quarter of 2014.
897077_15_ITEM15_P92_S1	Kellands Agricultural Ltd. was acquired on April 2, 2014 and Fieldquip Australia PTY LTD was acquired on April 7, 2014.
897077_15_ITEM15_P92_S2	Both acquisitions were on a debt free basis and subject to certain post-closing adjustments with total consideration of $5,594,000 .
897077_15_ITEM15_P93_S0	These acquisitions are being accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 805.
897077_15_ITEM15_P93_S1	Accordingly, the total purchase price has been allocated on a preliminary basis to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the completion of the acquisitions.
897077_15_ITEM15_P93_S2	These allocations reflect various provisional estimates that were available at the time and are subject to change during the purchase price allocation period as valuations are finalized.
897077_15_ITEM15_P94_S0	The primary reason for the Kellands acquisition was to increase the Company's presence in the manufacturing and distribution of agricultural machinery in the UK.
897077_15_ITEM15_P94_S1	This acquisition broadens our product offering and allows the Company to enter the self-propelled sprayer market.
897077_15_ITEM15_P95_S0	The primary reason for the Fieldquip acquisition was to broaden the Company's presence in the manufacturing and distribution of agricultural machinery in Australia.
897077_15_ITEM15_P96_S0	The following table sets forth the reconciliation from basic to diluted average common shares and the calculations of net income per common share.
897077_15_ITEM15_P96_S1	Net income for basic and diluted calculations does not differ.
897077_15_ITEM15_P97_S0	Stock options totaling 37,261 shares in 2014 , 3,831 shares in 2013 , and 38,954 shares in 2012 were not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
897077_15_ITEM15_P98_S0	4. VALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS Valuation and qualifying accounts included the following:
897077_15_ITEM15_P99_S0	The Company evaluates the collectability of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors.
897077_15_ITEM15_P99_S1	In circumstances where it is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations, the Company records a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what it believes will be collected.
897077_15_ITEM15_P100_S0	The Company evaluates all receivables that are over 60 days old and will reserve specifically on a 90 -day basis.
897077_15_ITEM15_P101_S0	The Company has a secured or insured interest on most of its wholegoods that each customer purchases.
897077_15_ITEM15_P101_S1	This allows the Company, in times of a difficult economy when the customer is unable to pay or has filed for bankruptcy, to repossess its inventory.
897077_15_ITEM15_P101_S2	This also allows Alamo Group in certain instances, to maintain only a reserve over its cost, which usually represents the margin on the original sales price.
897077_15_ITEM15_P102_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $ 2,853,000 on December 31, 2014 , and $ 2,738,000 on December 31, 2013 .
897077_15_ITEM15_P102_S1	The increase was primarily from the acquisition of Specialized .
897077_15_ITEM15_P103_S0	On December 31, 2014 , the Company had $ 15,999,000 in reserves for sales discounts compared to $ 16,724,000 on December 31, 2013 on product shipped to our customers under various promotional programs.
897077_15_ITEM15_P103_S1	The decrease was due primarily to lower sales volume of the Company s agricultural products during the 2014 pre-season, which runs during the third and fourth quarters of each year with orders shipped through the second quarter of 2015.
897077_15_ITEM15_P104_S0	The Company reviews the reserve quarterly based on analysis made on each program outstanding at the time.
897077_15_ITEM15_P105_S0	The Company bases its reserves on historical data relating to discounts taken by the customer under each program.
897077_15_ITEM15_P105_S1	Historically, between 90% and 95% of the Company s customers who qualify for each program actually take the discount that is available.
897077_15_ITEM15_P106_S0	The Company had a reserve of $ 7,601,000 on December 31, 2014 and $ 8,596,000 on December 31, 2013 to cover obsolete and slow moving inventory.
897077_15_ITEM15_P106_S1	The decrease in the reserve was mainly from the Company's Agricultural Division.
897077_15_ITEM15_P107_S0	The obsolete and slow moving inventory policy states that the reserve is to be calculated as follows: 1) no inventory usage over a three -year period is deemed obsolete and reserved at 100 percent ; and 2) slow moving inventory with little usage requires a 100 percent reserve on items that have a quantity greater than a three -year supply.
897077_15_ITEM15_P107_S1	There are exceptions to the obsolete and slow moving classifications if approved by an officer of the Company, based on specific identification of an item or items that are deemed to be either included or excluded from this classification.
897077_15_ITEM15_P107_S2	In cases where there is no historical data, management makes a judgment based on a specific review of the inventory in question to determine what reserves, if any, are appropriate.
897077_15_ITEM15_P107_S3	New products or parts are generally excluded from the reserve policy until a three -year history has been established.
897077_15_ITEM15_P108_S0	The Company s warranty policy is generally to provide its customers warranty for up to one year on all wholegood units and 90 days on parts, though some components can have warranty for longer terms.
897077_15_ITEM15_P109_S0	Warranty reserve, as a percentage of sales, is generally calculated by looking at the current twelve months expenses and prorating that amount based on twelve months sales with a ninety -day to six -month lag period.
897077_15_ITEM15_P109_S1	The Company s historical experience is that an end-user takes approximately 90 days to six months from the receipt of the unit to file a warranty claim.
897077_15_ITEM15_P109_S2	A warranty reserve is established for each different marketing group.
897077_15_ITEM15_P109_S3	Reserve balances are evaluated on a quarterly basis and adjustments made when required.
897077_15_ITEM15_P110_S0	The current liability warranty reserve balance was $ 5,913,000 on December 31, 2014 and $ 4,994,000 on December 31, 2013 and are included in Note 9.
897077_15_ITEM15_P110_S1	The increase was primarily from the acquisition of the Specialized in the amount of $1,006,000 .
897077_15_ITEM15_P111_S0	Inventories valued at LIFO represented 37% and 55% of total inventory for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
897077_15_ITEM15_P111_S1	The excess of current costs over LIFO-valued inventories was $ 10,230,000 and $ 9,483,000 on December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , respectively.
897077_15_ITEM15_P111_S2	(The $ 747,000 increase in LIFO reserve during 2014 came from reductions in inventory levels within U.S. operations.
897077_15_ITEM15_P111_S3	Inventories consisted of the following on a cost basis, net of reserves:
897077_15_ITEM15_P112_S0	PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment consist of the following:
897077_15_ITEM15_P113_S0	Property, plant and equipment on December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 include capital leases in the amount of $ 412,000 and $ 7,246,000 , respectively, which are included in the listings above.
897077_15_ITEM15_P113_S1	Accumulated depreciation relating to the capital leases on December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $ 308,000 and $ 4,749,000 , respectively.
897077_15_ITEM15_P113_S2	Amortization related to the capital lease is included in depreciation expense.
897077_15_ITEM15_P113_S3	The decrease in capital leases in 2014 was due to the purchase of previously leased property.
897077_15_ITEM15_P114_S0	The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 , 2013 and 2014 are as follows:
897077_15_ITEM15_P115_S0	The Company has determined the value of the definite and indefinite-lived assets as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.
897077_15_ITEM15_P115_S1	The addition of the definite-lived assets related to the Specialized acquisition made during the second quarter of 2014.
897077_15_ITEM15_P115_S2	The following is a summary of both the Company's definite and indefinite-lived intangible assets net of the accumulated amortization:
897077_15_ITEM15_P116_S0	The Company's net carrying value of intangible assets with definite useful lives consists of trade names and trademarks at $21,548,000 , customer and dealer relationships at $28,068,000 and patents and drawings at $1,868,000 .
897077_15_ITEM15_P116_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , the related accumulated amortization balance for the definite lived assets were $556,000 for trade names and trademarks, $1,336,000 for customer and dealer relationships, and $100,000 for Patents and drawings.
897077_15_ITEM15_P116_S2	The Company estimates amortization expense to be $3,176,000 for each of the next five years.
897077_15_ITEM15_P117_S0	ACCRUED LIABILITIES Accrued liabilities consist of the following balances:
897077_15_ITEM15_P118_S0	LONG-TERM DEBT The components of long-term debt are as follows:
897077_15_ITEM15_P119_S0	Effective May 12, 2014, the Company amended its revolving credit facility and increased its line of credit from $100,000,000 to $250,000,000 to accommodate the acquisition of the Specialized business units and meet the ongoing needs of the combined entities.
897077_15_ITEM15_P120_S0	The Company maintains a revolving credit facility with certain lenders under its Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement.
897077_15_ITEM15_P120_S1	The aggregate commitments from lenders under such revolving credit facility total $250,000,000 and, subject to certain conditions, the Company has the option to request an increase in aggregate commitments of up to an additional $50,000,000 .
897077_15_ITEM15_P121_S0	The revolving credit agreement requires us to maintain various financial covenants including a minimum earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to interest expense ratio, a minimum leverage ratio and a minimum asset coverage ratio.
897077_15_ITEM15_P121_S1	The agreement also contains various covenants relating to limitations on indebtedness, limitations on investments and acquisitions, limitations on sale of properties, and limitations on liens and capital expenditures.
897077_15_ITEM15_P121_S2	The revolving credit agreement also contains other customary covenants, representations and events of defaults.
897077_15_ITEM15_P121_S3	As of December 31, 2014 , the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the revolving credit facility.
897077_15_ITEM15_P121_S4	The termination date of the revolving credit facility is May 12, 2019 .
897077_15_ITEM15_P121_S5	As of December 31, 2014 , $190,000,000 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with a weighted average interest rate of 2.5% .
897077_15_ITEM15_P121_S6	On December 31, 2014 , $ 1,090,000 of the revolver capacity was committed to irrevocable standby letters of credit issued in the ordinary course of business as required by vendors contracts resulting in $ 58,910,000 in available borrowings.
897077_15_ITEM15_P122_S0	The aggregate maturities of long-term debt, as of December 31, 2014 , are as follows: $ 516,000 in 2015 ; zero in 2016 , 2017 and 2018; $190,000,000 in 2019 and zero thereafter.
897077_15_ITEM15_P123_S0	The fair value of the Company s debt is based on secondary market indicators.
897077_15_ITEM15_P123_S1	Since the Company s debt is not quoted, estimates are based on each obligation s characteristics, including remaining maturities, interest rate, credit rating, collateral, amortization schedule and liquidity.
897077_15_ITEM15_P123_S2	The carrying value of our debt approximates the fair value as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , as the floating rates on our outstanding balances approximate current market rates.
897077_15_ITEM15_P124_S0	This conclusion was made based on Level 2 inputs.
897077_15_ITEM15_P125_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
897077_15_ITEM15_P126_S0	There is a three-tier fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs used in valuation techniques.
897077_15_ITEM15_P126_S1	Observable inputs (highest level) reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs (lowest level) reflect internally developed market assumptions.
897077_15_ITEM15_P126_S2	In fair value, measurements are classified under the following hierarchy:
897077_15_ITEM15_P127_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
897077_15_ITEM15_P127_S1	Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs or significant value-drivers are observable in active markets.
897077_15_ITEM15_P127_S2	Level 3 Model-derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs or significant value-drivers are unobservable.
897077_15_ITEM15_P128_S0	The Company uses quoted market prices, when available, to determine fair value, and the Company classifies such measurements within Level 1.
897077_15_ITEM15_P128_S1	In some cases where market prices are not available, the Company makes use of observable market-based inputs to calculate fair value, in which case the measurements are classified with Level 2.
897077_15_ITEM15_P129_S0	If quoted or observable market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that use, where possible, current market-based parameters such as interest rates, yield curves, currency rates, etc.
897077_15_ITEM15_P129_S1	These measurements are classified within Level 3.
897077_15_ITEM15_P130_S0	Fair value measurements are classified to the lowest level input or value-driver that is significant to the valuation.
897077_15_ITEM15_P130_S1	A measurement may therefore be classified within Level 3 even though there may be significant inputs that are readily observable.
897077_15_ITEM15_P131_S0	The Company does not currently have any assets or liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.
897077_15_ITEM15_P131_S1	Fair value measurements are also used in connection with nonrecurring valuations performed in connection with impairment assessments and acquisition accounting.
897077_15_ITEM15_P132_S0	In completing the analysis of the fair values of certain of the acquired assets in the current year acquisitions, discounted cash flow models were used, which were principally based upon internal assumptions.
897077_15_ITEM15_P132_S1	In valuing certain of the acquired intangible assets we used an excess earnings methodology, which is a form of a discounted cash flow analysis.
897077_15_ITEM15_P133_S0	Tangible assets were valued using a replacement or reproduction cost approach, considering factors such as current prices of the same or similar equipment, the age of the equipment and economic obsolescence.
897077_15_ITEM15_P134_S0	The implied value of goodwill is determined by allocating the acquisition cost to all of the assets and liabilities of the acquired entity, with the residual amount allocated to goodwill.
897077_15_ITEM15_P135_S0	All of our nonrecurring valuations use significant unobservable inputs and therefore fall under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
897077_15_ITEM15_P136_S0	The jurisdictional components of income before taxes consist of the following:
897077_15_ITEM15_P137_S0	The components of income tax expense (benefit) consist of the following:
897077_15_ITEM15_P138_S0	The difference between income tax expense (benefit) for financial statement purposes and the amount of income tax expense computed by applying the domestic statutory income tax rate of 35% to income before income taxes consist of the following:
897077_15_ITEM15_P139_S0	Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis.
897077_15_ITEM15_P139_S1	The components of the Company s deferred income tax assets and liabilities consist of the following:
897077_15_ITEM15_P140_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , the Company had foreign deferred tax assets consisting of foreign net operating losses and other tax benefits available to reduce future taxable income in a foreign jurisdiction.
897077_15_ITEM15_P140_S1	These foreign jurisdictions' net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards are in the approximate amount of $4.6 million with an unlimited carryforward period.
897077_15_ITEM15_P140_S2	The Company also has U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards in the amount of $27,000 which will expire between 2015 to 2028.
897077_15_ITEM15_P141_S0	The company recorded a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 due to uncertainties related to the ability to utilize some of the deferred income tax assets, primarily consisting of certain U.S. state NOLs and income tax credits, and international NOLs, before they expire.
897077_15_ITEM15_P141_S1	The valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which deferred income tax assets will be recoverable.
897077_15_ITEM15_P141_S2	The realization of net deferred income tax assets recorded as of December 31, 2014 is primarily dependent upon the ability to generate future taxable income in certain U.S. states and international jurisdictions.
897077_15_ITEM15_P142_S0	Deferred income taxes have not been provided on the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases of the Company s foreign subsidiaries, based on the determination that such differences are essentially permanent in duration in that the earnings of the subsidiaries are expected to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations.
897077_15_ITEM15_P143_S0	of December 31, 2014 , the cumulative undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries approximated $ 151,868,000 .
897077_15_ITEM15_P143_S1	If these earnings were not considered indefinitely reinvested, deferred income taxes would have been recorded after the consideration of foreign tax credits.
897077_15_ITEM15_P143_S2	At this time, it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional income taxes that might be payable on those earnings, if distributed.
897077_15_ITEM15_P144_S0	The Company adopted the provisions of FASB ASC Section 740-10-25 (formerly FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes ) on January 1, 2007.
897077_15_ITEM15_P144_S1	Unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of $388,000 and $146,000 for 2014 and 2013 , respectively, are included in other noncurrent liabilities on the balance sheet.
897077_15_ITEM15_P144_S2	The unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would favorably impact our effective tax rate in a future period.
897077_15_ITEM15_P144_S3	We do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits disclosed above to change significantly over the next 12 months.
897077_15_ITEM15_P145_S0	The Company's policy is to include interest and penalty expense related to income taxes as interest and other expense, respectively.
897077_15_ITEM15_P145_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , no interest or penalties has been accrued.
897077_15_ITEM15_P145_S2	The Company s open tax years for its federal and state income tax returns are for the tax years ended 2010 through 2014 .
897077_15_ITEM15_P145_S3	The Company's open tax years for its foreign income tax returns are for the tax years ended 2010 through 2014.
897077_15_ITEM15_P146_S0	The Company was authorized by its Board of Directors in 1997 to repurchase up to 1,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock to be funded through working capital and credit facility borrowings.
897077_15_ITEM15_P146_S1	No shares were repurchased in 2014 or 2013 under this authorization.
897077_15_ITEM15_P146_S2	The authorization to repurchase up to 1,000,000 shares remains available less 42,600 shares, previously purchased.
897077_15_ITEM15_P147_S0	On September 24, 2014, the Company was authorized by its Board of Directors to enter into a Share Repurchase Agreement with Capital Southwest Corporation and Capital Southwest Venture Corporation ( Capital Southwest ).
897077_15_ITEM15_P147_S1	Pursuant to the Repurchase Agreement, the Company repurchased 849,690 shares of the Company s common stock owned by Capital Southwest at a purchase price of $40.255 per share .
897077_15_ITEM15_P147_S2	The closing price of the Company s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on September 24, 2014 was $41.50 per share.
897077_15_ITEM15_P147_S3	The Company financed the repurchase through borrowings under its revolving credit facility.
897077_15_ITEM15_P147_S4	The Company completed the transaction on September 25, 2014 and subsequently retired all 849,690 shares.
897077_15_ITEM15_P147_S5	In November 2014, the Company successfully completed a public offering of our shares on behalf of Capital Southwest Corporation.
897077_15_ITEM15_P148_S0	On January 2, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share which was paid on January 30, 2015 to holders of record as of January 16, 2015.

897077_15_ITEM15_P165_S1	The Company measures the funded status of a plan as of the date of the year-end consolidated balance sheet.
897077_15_ITEM15_P166_S0	The underfunded status of the plans of $5,714,000 and $2,538,000 as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, is recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as long-term accrued pension liability because plan assets are less than the value of benefit obligations expected to be paid.
897077_15_ITEM15_P167_S0	The accumulated benefit obligation for our pension plans represents the actuarial present value of benefits based on employee service and compensation as of a certain date and does not include an assumption about future compensation levels.
897077_15_ITEM15_P168_S0	In determining the projected benefit obligation and the net pension cost, we used the following significant weighted-average assumptions:
897077_15_ITEM15_P169_S0	Assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31:
897077_15_ITEM15_P170_S0	Assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December 31:
897077_15_ITEM15_P171_S0	The Company employs a building block approach in determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
897077_15_ITEM15_P171_S1	Historical markets are studied and long-term historical relationships between equities and fixed income are preserved consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run.
897077_15_ITEM15_P171_S2	Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term market assumptions are determined.
897077_15_ITEM15_P171_S3	The long-term portfolio return is established via a building block approach with proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing.
897077_15_ITEM15_P171_S4	Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness.
897077_15_ITEM15_P172_S0	The following tables present the components of net periodic benefit cost (gains are denoted with parentheses and losses are not):
897077_15_ITEM15_P173_S0	The Company estimates that $ 649,000 of unrecognized actuarial expense will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic benefit costs during 2015 .
897077_15_ITEM15_P174_S0	The Company employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk.
897077_15_ITEM15_P174_S1	Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condition.
897077_15_ITEM15_P175_S0	The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income investments.
897077_15_ITEM15_P175_S1	Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks, as well as growth, value, and small and large capitalizations.
897077_15_ITEM15_P175_S2	Other assets such as real estate, private equity, and hedge funds are used judiciously to enhance long-term returns while improving portfolio diversification.
897077_15_ITEM15_P175_S3	Derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely manner; however, derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of the underlying investments.
897077_15_ITEM15_P176_S0	Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements, and periodic asset/liability studies.
897077_15_ITEM15_P177_S0	Our current asset allocations are consistent with our targeted allocations.
897077_15_ITEM15_P178_S0	The pension plans' weighted-average asset allocations as a percentage of plan assets at December 31 are as follows:
897077_15_ITEM15_P179_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , we used the following valuation techniques to measure fair value for assets.
897077_15_ITEM15_P179_S1	There were no changes to these methodologies during 2014 :
897077_15_ITEM15_P180_S0	Level 1 - Assets were valued using the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual security was traded.
897077_15_ITEM15_P180_S1	Level 2 - Assets were valued using quoted prices in markets that are not active, broker dealer quotations, net asset value of shares held by the plans, and other methods by which all significant input was observable at the measurement date.
897077_15_ITEM15_P180_S2	Level 3 - Assets were valued using valuation reports from the respective institutions at the measurement date.
897077_15_ITEM15_P180_S3	The following table presents the hierarchy levels for our postretirement benefit plan investments as of December 31:
897077_15_ITEM15_P181_S0	Our interests in the common collective trust investments are managed by one custodian.
897077_15_ITEM15_P181_S1	Consistent with our investment policy, the custodian has invested the assets across a widely diversified portfolio of U.S. and international equity and fixed income securities.
897077_15_ITEM15_P181_S2	Fair values of each security within the collective trust as of December 31, 2014 were obtained from the custodian and are based on quoted market prices of individual investments; however, since the fund itself does not have immediate liquidity or a quoted market price, these assets are considered Level 2.
897077_15_ITEM15_P182_S0	The common collective funds noted in the above table have estimated fair value using the net asset value per share of investments.
897077_15_ITEM15_P182_S1	Investments can be redeemed immediately at the current net asset value per share based on the fair value of the underlying assets.
897077_15_ITEM15_P183_S0	The categories contain investments in equity securities of smaller growing companies, medium-sized U.S. companies, large value-oriented and growth-oriented companies, and foreign companies traded on international markets.
897077_15_ITEM15_P184_S0	Expected benefit payments are estimated using the same assumptions used in determining our benefit obligation as of December 31, 2014 .
897077_15_ITEM15_P184_S1	The following table illustrates the estimated pension benefit payments which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, that are projected to be paid:

897077_15_ITEM15_P186_S0	The SERP is intended to provide a benefit from the Company upon retirement, death or disability, or a change in control of the Company.
897077_15_ITEM15_P186_S1	Accordingly, the SERP obligates the Company to pay to a participant a Retirement Benefit (as defined in the SERP) upon the occurrence of certain payment events to the extent a participant has a vested right thereto.
897077_15_ITEM15_P186_S2	A participant s right to his or her Retirement Benefit becomes vested in the Company s contributions upon 10 years of Credited Service (as defined in the SERP) or a change in control of the Company.
897077_15_ITEM15_P186_S3	The Retirement Benefit is based on 20% of the final three -year average salary of each participant on or after his or her normal retirement age ( 65 years of age).
897077_15_ITEM15_P186_S4	In the event of the participant s death or a change in control, the participant s vested retirement benefit will be paid in a lump sum to the participant or his or her estate, as applicable, within 90 days after the participant s death or a change in control, as applicable.
897077_15_ITEM15_P186_S5	In the event the participant is entitled to a benefit from the SERP due to disability, retirement or other termination of employment, the benefit will be paid in monthly installments over a period of fifteen years.
897077_15_ITEM15_P187_S0	The Company records amounts relating to the SERP based on calculations that incorporate various actuarial and other assumptions, including discount rates, rate of compensation increases, retirement dates and life expectancies.
897077_15_ITEM15_P187_S1	The net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn the SERP benefits.
897077_15_ITEM15_P188_S0	In connection with the initiation of the SERP, the Company had an unfunded long-term liability of $1,964,301 , a deferred tax asset of $746,000 , and $1,218,301 in accumulated other comprehensive income.
897077_15_ITEM15_P188_S1	The $1,964,301 includes prior service cost which will be amortized over the average remaining service periods of the employees.

897077_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	You should carefully consider each of the risks described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision with respect to the Company s securities.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the following risks develop into actual events, the Company s business, financial condition or results from operations could be materially and adversely affected and you could lose all or part of your investment.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Deterioration of industry conditions could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our business depends to a large extent upon the prospects for the mowing, right-of-way maintenance and agricultural markets in general.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Future prospects of the industry depend largely on factors outside of our control.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Any of those factors could adversely impact demand for our products, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	increase in unfunded pension plan liability due to financial market deterioration.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In addition, our business is susceptible to a number of factors that specifically affect agricultural customer spending patterns, including the following:
897077_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	A downturn in general economic conditions and outlook in the United States and around the world could adversely affect our net sales and earnings.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The strength and profitability of our business depends on the overall demand for our products and upon economic conditions and outlook, including but not limited to economic growth rates; consumer spending levels; financing availability, pricing and terms for our dealers and end-users; employment rates; interest rates; inflation; consumer confidence and general economic and political conditions and expectations in the United States and the other economies in which we conduct business.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	outlook could cause consumers to continue to reduce spending, which may cause them to delay or forgo purchases of our products and could have an adverse effect on our net sales and earnings.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We depend on governmental sales and a decrease in such sales could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales to federal, state and local governmental entities and related contractors, both in the U.S. and in other countries in which we sell our products.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	These sales depend primarily on the levels of budgeted and appropriated expenditures for highway, airport, roadside and parks maintenance by various governmental entities and are affected by changes in local and national economic conditions.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our dependence on, and the price and availability of, raw materials as well as purchased components may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We are subject to fluctuations in market prices for raw materials such as steel and energy.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In addition, although most of the raw materials and purchase components we use are commercially available from a number of sources, we could experience disruptions in the availability of such materials.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P11_S2	If we are unable to purchase materials we require or are unable to pass on price increases to our customers or otherwise reduce our cost of goods sold, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P11_S3	In addition, higher energy costs could negatively affect spending by farmers, including their purchases of our products.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	This analysis requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	The cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of time, which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to an even higher degree of uncertainty.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P13_S3	The Company also utilizes market valuation models and other financial ratios, which require the Company to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to its assets and businesses.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , goodwill was $ 75,509,000 , which represents 13% of total assets.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The Company recognized no goodwill impairment in 2015 , 2014 or 2013 .
897077_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	During the third quarter of 2015, the Company changed its annual goodwill and intangible assets impairment testing date from December 31 to October 1.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P15_S2	During the 2015 impairment analysis review, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 15% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit as of October 1, 2015 would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any of the reporting units.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We are significantly dependent on information technology.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic and financial information, to manage a variety of business processes and activities, and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	We also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations, personnel, customers, and suppliers.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	These information technology systems, (some of which are provided and maintained by third parties), may be susceptible to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to hardware failures, computer viruses, hacker attacks, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophic events or other factors.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	If our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience business disruptions, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of customers and sales, causing our product sales, financial condition, and operating results to be adversely affected and the reporting of our financial results to be delayed.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information or other sensitive information of our customers and employees.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Despite the information security measures we have taken, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, disruption of our operations and the services we provide to customers, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We operate in a highly competitive industry, and some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater resources than we do.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our products are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	We compete with several large national and international companies that offer a broad range of equipment and replacement parts that compete with our products, as well as with numerous small, privately-held manufacturers and suppliers of a limited number of products mainly on a regional basis.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Some of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater financial and other resources at their disposal.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P22_S3	We believe that we are able to compete successfully in our markets by, to some extent, avoiding direct competition with significantly larger potential competitors.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P22_S4	There can be no assurance that our competitors will not substantially increase the resources devoted to the development and marketing of products competitive with our products or that new competitors with greater resources will not enter our markets.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Any failure to effectively compete could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We operate and source internationally, which exposes us to the political, economic and other risks of doing business abroad.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We have operations in a number of countries outside of the United States and we source raw materials and components globally.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Our international operations are subject to the risks normally associated with conducting business in foreign countries, including but not limited to the following:
897077_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the United States and the other countries in which we operate affecting foreign trade, investment and taxation.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	In addition, political developments and governmental regulations and policies in the countries in which we operate directly affect the demand for our products.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	For example, decreases or delays in farm subsidies to our agricultural customers, or changes in environmental policies aimed at limiting mowing activities, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our acquisition strategy may not be successful, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We intend to grow internally and through the acquisition of businesses and assets that will complement our current businesses.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	To date, a material portion of our growth has come through acquisitions.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P28_S2	We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition targets, obtain financing for acquisitions on satisfactory terms or successfully acquire identified targets.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	making acquisitions or prevent us from making certain acquisitions.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	These and other acquisition-related factors may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We may be unable to complete or integrate existing or future acquisitions effectively, and businesses we have acquired, or may acquire in the future, may not perform as expected.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We may not be successful in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations and achieving projected synergies.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P31_S1	We could face many risks in integrating acquired businesses, including but not limited to the following:
897077_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	we may encounter unanticipated events, circumstances or legal liabilities.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts from the management of each entity, including coordinating existing business plans and research and development efforts.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Integrating operations may distract management s attention from the day-to-day operation of the combined companies.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Ultimately, our attempts to integrate the operations, technology and personnel of acquired businesses may not be successful.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P33_S3	If we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses, our future results may be negatively impacted.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	In addition, we may be adversely affected if businesses that we have acquired, or that we acquire in the future, do not perform as expected.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P34_S1	An acquired business could perform below our expectations for a number of reasons, including legislative or regulatory changes that affect the areas in which the acquired business specializes, the loss of customers and dealers, general economic factors that directly affect the acquired business, and the cultural incompatibility of its management team.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Any or all of these reasons could adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The agricultural industry and the infrastructure maintenance industry are seasonal and are affected by the weather, and seasonal fluctuations may cause our results of operations and working capital to fluctuate from quarter to quarter.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	In general, agricultural and governmental end-users typically purchase new equipment during the first and second calendar quarters.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Other products such as street sweepers, excavators, snow removal equipment, front-end loaders and pothole patchers have different seasonal patterns, as do replacement parts in general.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P36_S2	In attempting to achieve efficient utilization of manpower and facilities throughout the year, we estimate seasonal demand months in advance and manufacturing capacity is scheduled in anticipation of such demand.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P36_S3	We utilize an annual plan with updated quarterly sales forecasts provided by our marketing divisions and order backlog in order to develop a production plan for our manufacturing facilities.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P36_S4	In addition, many of our marketing departments attempt to equalize demand for their products throughout the calendar year by offering seasonal sales programs which may provide additional incentives, including discounts and extended payment terms, on equipment that is ordered during off-season periods.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P36_S5	Because we spread our production and wholesale shipments throughout the year to take into account the factors described above, sales in any given period may not reflect the timing of dealer orders and retail demand.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Weather conditions and general economic conditions may affect the timing of purchases and actual industry conditions might differ from our forecasts.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Consequently, sudden or significant declines in industry demand could adversely affect our working capital or results of operations.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	If we do not retain key personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees, our business may suffer.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our continued success will depend on, among other things, the efforts and skills of our executive officers, including our president and chief executive officer, and our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified managerial, technical, manufacturing, and sales and marketing personnel.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P39_S1	We do not maintain key man life insurance for any of our employees, and all of our senior management are employed at will.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P39_S2	We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and hire suitable replacements for any of our key employees.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P39_S3	We believe the loss of a key executive officer or other key employee could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We may not be able to realize the potential or strategic benefits of the acquisitions we complete, or we may not be able to successfully address problems encountered in connection with acquisitions.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Acquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P41_S1	We have completed a number of acquisitions over the past several years.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P41_S2	We recently consummated three acquisitions in 2014; our acquisition of Fieldquip in Australia in April 2014; our acquisition of Kellands in the U.K., also in April 2014; and our acquisition of the Specialized business units in the U.S. in May 2014.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P41_S3	We expect to consider opportunities and make additional acquisitions in the future, but we may not find suitable acquisition targets or be able to consummate desired acquisitions due to among other things, unfavorable credit markets or other risks, which could harm our operating results.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Acquisitions can be difficult, time-consuming, and pose a number of risks, including:
897077_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	potential negative impact on our relationships with customers, distributors and vendors.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	If we do not manage these risks, the acquisitions that we complete may have an adverse effect on our business, our results of operations, or financial condition.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Increasingly stringent engine emission regulations could impact our ability to sell certain of our products into the market and appropriately price certain of our products, which could negatively affect our competitive position and financial results.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The products we manufacture or sell, particularly engines, are subject to increasingly stringent environmental emissions regulations.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P45_S1	For instance, the EPA has adopted increasingly stringent engine emissions regulations, including Tier 4 emission requirements applicable to diesel engines in specified horsepower ranges that are used in some of our products.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P45_S2	As of January 1, 2012, such requirements expanded to additional horsepower categories and, accordingly, apply to more of the products we sell.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P45_S3	While we have developed and implemented plans to achieve full and timely compliance with these requirements, our ability to meet the Tier 4 requirements is subject to many variables, some of which are beyond our direct control.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P45_S4	If we fail to meet the Tier 4 requirements and any other EPA emission standards that are currently in place or that may be introduced in the future, our ability to sell our products into the market may be limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position and financial results.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We are subject on an ongoing basis to the risk of product liability claims and other litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Like other manufacturers, we are subject to various claims, including product liability claims, arising in the ordinary course of business, and we are a party to various legal proceedings that constitute routine litigation incidental to our business.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P47_S1	We may be exposed to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury, property damage, or both.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	experience any material product liability losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend the Company against such claims.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P48_S1	While we currently have product liability insurance, we cannot assure you that our product liability insurance coverage will be adequate for any liabilities that may ultimately be incurred or that it will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P48_S2	A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage or a requirement to participate in a product recall may have a materially adverse effect on our business.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We are subject to environmental, health and safety and employment laws and regulations and related compliance expenditures and liabilities.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Like other manufacturers, the Company is subject to a broad range of federal, state, local and foreign laws and requirements, including those concerning air emissions, discharges into waterways, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials, as well as the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances at the Company s facilities and offsite disposal locations, workplace safety and equal employment opportunities.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P50_S1	These laws and regulations are constantly changing, and it is impossible to predict with accuracy the effect that changes to such laws and regulations may have on the Company in the future.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Like other industrial concerns, the Company s manufacturing operations entail the risk of noncompliance, and there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur material costs or other liabilities as a result thereof.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Certain properties of the Company contain asbestos that may have to be remediated over time and it could be additional expense to the Company.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The Company is subject to various other federal, state, and local laws affecting its business, as well as a variety of regulations relating to such matters as working conditions, equal employment opportunities, and product safety.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P53_S1	A variety of state laws regulate the Company s contractual relationships with its dealers, some of which impose restrictive standards on the relationship between the Company and its dealers, including events of default, grounds for termination, non-renewal of dealer contracts, and equipment repurchase requirements.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P54_S0	If we are unable to comply with the terms of our credit arrangements, especially the financial covenants, our credit arrangements could be terminated.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all of the terms of our credit arrangements, especially the financial covenants.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Our ability to comply with such terms depends on the success of our business and our operating results.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Various risks, uncertainties, and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with the terms of our credit arrangements.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P55_S3	If we were out of compliance with any covenant required by our credit arrangements following any applicable cure periods, the banks could terminate their commitments unless we could negotiate a covenant waiver.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P55_S4	The banks could condition such waiver on amendments to the terms of our credit arrangements that may be unfavorable to us, including, a potential increase to the interest rate we currently pay on outstanding debt under our credit arrangements could increase, which could adversely affect our operating results.
897077_16_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results.

897077_16_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We may issue shares of our previously authorized and unissued securities which will result in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders.

897077_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	The increase resulted primarily from a full year effect of sales in 2015 from the Specialized business units and other acquisitions compared to a partial year in 2014.
897077_16_ITEM7_P1_S2	This netted an additional $62,944,000 of sales in 2015.
897077_16_ITEM7_P1_S3	In the Company's Industrial Division sales of excavators, sweepers, and snow removal products were up in 2015 compared to 2014, however sales of mowing equipment and vacuum trucks were down due to adverse weather conditions early in the year and soft markets in the non-governmental sector.
897077_16_ITEM7_P1_S4	Agricultural Division sales were down 2.8% for 2015 due to a weak agricultural market compared to 2014.
897077_16_ITEM7_P1_S5	Sales in the European Division were down 8.6% in U.S. dollars as sales of UK and European products were lower 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of the impact of changes in currency translation rates.
897077_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	Net Industrial sales were $ 498,761,000 in 2015 compared to $ 436,018,000 in 2014 , an increase of $ 62,743,000 or 14.4% .
897077_16_ITEM7_P2_S1	The increase came primarily from the acquisition of the Specialized business units which netted additional sales of $57,887,000 in 2015.
897077_16_ITEM7_P2_S2	Also, favorably affecting sales were increases from sweeper, excavator, and snow removal equipment product lines.

897077_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	Net Agricultural sales were $ 208,257,000 in 2015 compared to $ 214,326,000 in 2014 , representing a decrease of $ 6,069,000 or 2.8% .
897077_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	The decrease in sales for 2015 compared to 2014 was driven by lower commodity prices and reduced farm income that resulted in softer market conditions in the agricultural market.
897077_16_ITEM7_P3_S2	Also affecting this Division were the prolonged winter weather conditions during the first quarter of 2015.
897077_16_ITEM7_P3_S3	Sales from Herder which was acquired in March 2015, contributed $2,603,000 for 2015.

897077_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	The decrease in 2015 was primarily due to the negative effect on sales from changes in currency translation rates.
897077_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	The European Division continued to be faced with challenging market conditions particularly in France as agricultural markets were constrained by Europe's overall economic uncertainty.
897077_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	Gross margins for 2015 were $ 202,448,000 ( 23.0% of net sales) compared to $ 189,228,000 ( 22.6% of net sales) in 2014 , an increase of $ 13,220,000 .
897077_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	The increase in margin dollars was mainly due to the full year effect from the acquisitions of the Specialized business units, Kellands and Fieldquip in the amount of $14,012,000.
897077_16_ITEM7_P6_S2	Negatively affecting both the gross margin and margin percent during 2015 and 2014, respectively, were $2,740,000 and $2,578,000 in higher cost of goods sold related to the step-up in fair value of inventory in the Specialized business units.

897077_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	Other income (expense), net was income of $ 6,874,000 during 2015 compared to income of $ 1,767,000 in 2014 .
897077_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	The income in 2015 was primarily from the gain on the sale of excess land in the U.K. in the amount of $3,796,000 and changes in exchange rates.
897077_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	In 2014 the gain was mainly the result of changes in exchange rates and governmental grants received in the U.K.

897077_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	The increase in the effective income tax rate for 2015 compared to 2014 reflects the acquisition of the Specialized business units which are located in jurisdictions subject to tax rates above the Company's average.
897077_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	Net income for 2015 was $ 43,209,000 compared to $ 41,151,000 in 2014 due to the factors described above.

897077_16_ITEM7_P12_S2	Also, improved sales in the Company's Industrial Division, which was up 10.3%, excluding the impact of the acquisition of the Specialized business units, was a contributing factor.
897077_16_ITEM7_P12_S3	Agricultural Division sales excluding the acquisitions of Fieldquip and Superior were down 4.2% for 2014 mainly from declining crop prices, a weak overall agricultural market and adverse weather conditions throughout 2014.

897077_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	Critical Accounting Estimates Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ).
897077_16_ITEM7_P51_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
897077_16_ITEM7_P51_S2	Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
897077_16_ITEM7_P51_S3	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
897077_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the financial statements.
897077_16_ITEM7_P52_S1	Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
897077_16_ITEM7_P52_S2	For further information on the critical accounting policies, see Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
897077_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	In the last ten years, we have acquired twelve businesses.
897077_16_ITEM7_P53_S1	The purchase prices of acquired businesses have been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based upon their estimated fair value at the date of purchase.
897077_16_ITEM7_P53_S2	The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
897077_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	Tangible assets are typically valued using a replacement or reproduction cost approach, considering factors such as current prices of the same or similar equipment, the age of the equipment, and economic obsolescence.
897077_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	In making other assumptions on valuation and useful lives, we considered the unique nature of the acquisition and we utilized a third-party valuation firm to assist us in the valuation of the acquired intangibles and the resulting allocation of purchase price for the acquisition.
897077_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	The Company evaluates the collectability of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors.
897077_16_ITEM7_P56_S1	In circumstances where it is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations, the Company records a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what it believes will be collected.
897077_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	The Company evaluates all receivables that are over 60 days old and will reserve specifically on a 90-day basis.
897077_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	The Company has a secured or insured interest on most of its wholegoods that each customer purchases.
897077_16_ITEM7_P58_S1	This allows the Company, in times of a difficult economy when the customer is unable to pay or has filed for bankruptcy, to repossess its inventory.
897077_16_ITEM7_P58_S2	This also allows Alamo Group in certain instances, to maintain only a reserve over its cost, which usually represents the margin on the original sales price.
897077_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $ 3,484,000 on December 31, 2015 , and $ 2,853,000 on December 31, 2014 .
897077_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	The increase was primarily from the Company's U.S. operations.

897077_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	The Company bases its reserves on historical data relating to discounts taken by the customer under each program.
897077_16_ITEM7_P61_S1	Historically, between 85% and 95% of the Company s customers who qualify for each program actually take the discount that is available.

897077_16_ITEM7_P62_S1	The increase in the reserve was mainly from the Company's Industrial Division.
897077_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	The obsolete and slow moving inventory policy states that the reserve is to be calculated as follows: 1) no inventory usage over a three-year period is deemed obsolete and reserved at 100 percent; and 2) slow moving inventory with little usage requires a 100 percent reserve on items that have a quantity greater than a three-year supply.
897077_16_ITEM7_P63_S1	There are exceptions to the obsolete and slow moving classifications if approved by an officer of the Company, based on specific identification of an item or items that are deemed to be either included or excluded from this classification.
897077_16_ITEM7_P63_S2	In cases where there is no historical data, management makes a judgment based on a specific review of the inventory in question to determine what reserves, if any, are appropriate.
897077_16_ITEM7_P63_S3	New products or parts are generally excluded from the reserve policy until a three-year history has been established.
897077_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	The reserve is reviewed and, if necessary, adjustments are made on a quarterly basis.
897077_16_ITEM7_P64_S1	The Company relies on historical information when available to support its reserve.
897077_16_ITEM7_P64_S2	The Company does not adjust the reserve balance until the inventory is liquidated.
897077_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	The Company s warranty policy is generally to provide its customers warranty for up to one year on all wholegood units and 90 days on parts, though some components can have warranty for longer terms.
897077_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	Warranty reserve, as a percentage of sales, is generally calculated by looking at the current twelve months expenses and prorating that amount based on twelve months sales with a ninety-day to six-month lag period.
897077_16_ITEM7_P66_S1	The Company s historical experience is that an end-user takes approximately 90 days to six months from the receipt of the unit to file a warranty claim.
897077_16_ITEM7_P66_S2	A warranty reserve is established for each different marketing group.
897077_16_ITEM7_P66_S3	Reserve balances are evaluated on a quarterly basis and adjustments made when required.
897077_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	The current liability warranty reserve balance was $ 5,566,000 on December 31, 2015 and $ 5,913,000 on December 31, 2014 .
897077_16_ITEM7_P67_S1	The decrease was primarily in the Company's U.S. operations.
897077_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	We test goodwill and definite lived intangible assets for impairment annually, at the reporting unit level, and whenever events or circumstances make it likely that an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell all or a portion of a reporting unit.
897077_16_ITEM7_P68_S1	During the third quarter of 2015, the Company changed its annual goodwill and intangible assets impairment testing date from December 31 to October 1.
897077_16_ITEM7_P68_S2	Management considers this accounting change preferable because it allows the Company additional time to complete the annual goodwill test.
897077_16_ITEM7_P68_S3	This change does not accelerate, delay, avoid, or cause an impairment charge, nor does this change result in adjustments to previously issued financial statements.
897077_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	We perform our annual goodwill and intangible assets impairment test and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis.
897077_16_ITEM7_P70_S0	Goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing a qualitative assessment or a two-step process.
897077_16_ITEM7_P70_S1	We have an option to make a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit's goodwill and intangible assets for impairment.
897077_16_ITEM7_P70_S2	If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary.
897077_16_ITEM7_P71_S0	For reporting units where we perform the two-step process, the first step requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill and intangible assets.
897077_16_ITEM7_P71_S1	If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill and intangible assets are not considered impaired.
897077_16_ITEM7_P71_S2	If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, there is an indication that an impairment may exist and the second step is required.
897077_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	In step two, the implied fair value of goodwill and intangible assets are calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities.
897077_16_ITEM7_P72_S1	If the implied fair value of goodwill and intangible assets are less than the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill, the difference is recognized as an impairment loss.
897077_16_ITEM7_P73_S0	The Company has indefinite-lived assets that consist of trade names and are not subject to amortization.
897077_16_ITEM7_P73_S1	The Company tests its indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis at year-end, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset could be below its carrying amount.
897077_16_ITEM7_P73_S2	The impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, determined using the relief from royalty method, with its carrying amount.
897077_16_ITEM7_P73_S3	An impairment loss would be recognized for the carrying amount in excess of its fair value.
897077_16_ITEM7_P74_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis.
897077_16_ITEM7_P74_S1	This analysis requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates.
897077_16_ITEM7_P74_S2	The cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of time, which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to an even higher degree of uncertainty.
897077_16_ITEM7_P74_S3	The Company also utilizes market valuation models and other financial ratios, which require the Company to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to its assets and businesses.
897077_16_ITEM7_P75_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , goodwill was $ 75,509,000 , which represents 13% of total assets.
897077_16_ITEM7_P76_S0	The Company recognized no goodwill impairment in 2015 , 2014 or 2013 .
897077_16_ITEM7_P76_S1	During the 2015 impairment analysis review, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 15% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit as of October 1, 2015 would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any of the reporting units.
897077_16_ITEM7_P77_S0	Management believes that the estimated valuations it arrived at are reasonable and consistent with what other marketplace participants would use in valuing the Company's components.
897077_16_ITEM7_P78_S0	assurance that these market values will not change in the future.
897077_16_ITEM7_P78_S1	For example, if discount rates demanded by the market increase, this could lead to reduced valuations under the income approach.
897077_16_ITEM7_P78_S2	If the Company's projections are not achieved in the future, this could lead management to reassess their assumptions and lead to reduced valuations under the income approach.
897077_16_ITEM7_P78_S3	If the market price of the Company's stock decreases, this could cause the Company to reassess the reasonableness of the implied control premium, which might cause management to assume a higher discount rate under the income approach which could lead to reduced valuations.
897077_16_ITEM7_P78_S4	If future similar transactions exhibit lower multiples than those observed in the past, this could lead to reduced valuations under the similar transactions approach.
897077_16_ITEM7_P78_S5	And finally, if there is a general decline in the stock market and particularly in those companies selected as comparable to the Company's components, this could lead to reduced valuations under the public company market multiple approach.
897077_16_ITEM7_P79_S0	The Company's annual impairment test is performed during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.
897077_16_ITEM7_P79_S1	Given the current market conditions and continued economic uncertainty, the fair value of the Company's components could deteriorate, which could result in the need to record impairment charges in future periods.
897077_16_ITEM7_P79_S2	The Company also monitors potential triggering events including changes in the business climate in which it operates, attrition of key personnel, volatility in the capital markets, the Company's market capitalization compared to its book value, the Company's recent operating performance, and the Company's financial projections.
897077_16_ITEM7_P79_S3	The occurrence of one or more triggering events could require additional impairment testing, which could result in future impairment charges.
897077_16_ITEM7_P80_S0	See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding goodwill.
897077_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The Company is exposed to various financial market risks.
897077_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates.
897077_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The Company does not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
897077_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	A portion of the Company s operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities in international jurisdictions.
897077_16_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The Company manufactures its products primarily in the United States, the U.K., France, Canada and Australia.
897077_16_ITEM7A_P2_S2	The Company sells its products primarily within the markets where the products are produced, but certain of the Company s sales from its U.K. and Canadian operations are denominated in other currencies.
897077_16_ITEM7A_P2_S3	As a result, the Company s financials, specifically the value of its foreign assets, could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the other markets in which the subsidiaries of the Company distribute their products.
897077_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	To mitigate the short-term effect of changes in currency exchange rates on the Company s functional currency-based sales, the Company s U.K. and Canadian subsidiaries regularly enter into foreign exchange contracts for over 90% of their future net foreign currency cash receipts over a period of six months.
897077_16_ITEM7A_P3_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had a notional amount of $ 4,309,000 in outstanding forward exchange contracts related to accounts receivable.
897077_16_ITEM7A_P3_S2	A 15% fluctuation in exchange rates for these currencies would change the fair value by approximately $ 646,000 .
897077_16_ITEM7A_P3_S3	However, since these contracts offset foreign currency denominated transactions, any change in the fair value of the contracts should be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction.
897077_16_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The Company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominantly in European countries, and Canada, to a lesser extent, Australia and Brazil, as a result of the sale of its products in international markets.
897077_16_ITEM7A_P4_S1	Foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the U.K. are used to offset the earnings effects of such fluctuations.
897077_16_ITEM7A_P4_S2	On December 31, 2015 , the result of a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies in which the Company s sales are denominated would have been a decrease in gross profit of $ 5,424,000 .
897077_16_ITEM7A_P4_S3	Comparatively, on December 31, 2014 , the result of a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which the Company s sales are denominated would have been a decrease in gross profit of approximately $ 5,906,000 .
897077_16_ITEM7A_P5_S0	This calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar.
897077_16_ITEM7A_P6_S0	may also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive.
897077_16_ITEM7A_P6_S1	The Company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices.
897077_16_ITEM7A_P6_S2	The translation adjustment during 2015 was a loss of $20,112,000 .
897077_16_ITEM7A_P6_S3	On December 31, 2015 , the British pound closed at 0.6786 relative to the U.S. dollar, and the Euro closed at 0.9207 relative to the U.S. dollar.
897077_16_ITEM7A_P6_S4	By comparison, on December 31, 2014 , the British pound closed at 0.6419 relative to the U.S. dollar, and the Euro closed at 0.8265 relative to the U.S. dollar.
897077_16_ITEM7A_P7_S0	No assurance can be given as to future valuation of the British pound or Euro or how further movements in those or other currencies could affect future earnings or the financial position of the Company.
897077_16_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Interest Rate Risk The majority of the Company s long-term debt bears interest at variable rates.
897077_16_ITEM7A_P8_S1	Accordingly, the Company s net income is affected by changes in interest rates.
897077_16_ITEM7A_P8_S2	Assuming the average level of borrowings at variable rates and a two hundred basis point change in the 2015 average interest rate under these borrowings, the Company s 2015 interest expense would have changed by approximately $ 3,890,000 .
897077_16_ITEM7A_P9_S0	In the event of an adverse change in interest rates, management could take actions to mitigate its exposure.
897077_16_ITEM7A_P9_S1	Further, this analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment.
897077_16_ITEM7A_P9_S2	However, challenges affecting the banking industry and credit markets in general can potentially cause changes to credit availability and cost of borrowing, which creates a level of uncertainty.

897077_16_ITEM15_P9_S0	We have audited Alamo Group Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
897077_16_ITEM15_P9_S1	Alamo Group Inc. s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
897077_16_ITEM15_P9_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
897077_16_ITEM15_P10_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
897077_16_ITEM15_P10_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
897077_16_ITEM15_P10_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

897077_16_ITEM15_P10_S4	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
897077_16_ITEM15_P11_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
897077_16_ITEM15_P11_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
897077_16_ITEM15_P12_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
897077_16_ITEM15_P12_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

897077_16_ITEM15_P21_S0	The Company manufactures, distributes and services high quality tractor-mounted mowing and other vegetation maintenance equipment, street sweepers, excavators, vacuum trucks, snow removal equipment, pothole patchers, zero turn radius mowers, agricultural implements and related aftermarket parts and services.
897077_16_ITEM15_P22_S0	The Company manages its business through three principal reporting segments: Agricultural, Industrial and European, which are discussed in Note 16.
897077_16_ITEM15_P23_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Alamo Group Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company or Alamo Group ), all of which are wholly owned.
897077_16_ITEM15_P23_S1	All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
897077_16_ITEM15_P24_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
897077_16_ITEM15_P24_S1	Judgments related to asset impairment and certain reserves are particularly subject to change.
897077_16_ITEM15_P24_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
897077_16_ITEM15_P24_S3	Such estimates include, but are not limited to, allowance for doubtful accounts, reserve for sales discounts, estimated realizable value on obsolete and slow-moving inventory; warranty reserve, estimates related to pension accounting; estimates related to fair value for purposes of assessing goodwill, long-lived assets and intangible assets for impairment; estimates related to income taxes; and estimates related to contingencies.
897077_16_ITEM15_P25_S0	The Company translates the assets and liabilities of foreign-owned subsidiaries at rates in effect at the end of the year.
897077_16_ITEM15_P25_S1	Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates in effect during the reporting period.
897077_16_ITEM15_P25_S2	Translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
897077_16_ITEM15_P26_S0	The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to limit its exposure to certain foreign currency transactions.
897077_16_ITEM15_P26_S1	The Company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.
897077_16_ITEM15_P26_S2	On December 31, 2015 , the Company had a notional amount of $ 4,309,000 in outstanding forward exchange contracts related to sales.
897077_16_ITEM15_P26_S3	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
897077_16_ITEM15_P26_S4	As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 , there was no restricted cash.
897077_16_ITEM15_P27_S0	Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable.
897077_16_ITEM15_P27_S1	The credit risk is limited because of the large numbers and types of customers and their geographic dispersion.
897077_16_ITEM15_P28_S0	Inventories of U.S. operating subsidiaries are stated at the lower of cost (last-in, first-out method) ( LIFO ) or market, and the Company s international subsidiaries inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) ( FIFO ) or market.
897077_16_ITEM15_P29_S0	Inventory costs include those costs directly attributable to products, including raw materials, labor and overhead.
897077_16_ITEM15_P30_S0	Property, plant, and equipment are stated on the basis of cost.
897077_16_ITEM15_P30_S1	Major renewals and betterments are charged to the property accounts while replacements, maintenance and repairs, which do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets, are expensed to the current period.
897077_16_ITEM15_P31_S0	Depreciation is provided at amounts calculated to amortize the cost of the assets over their estimated useful economic lives using the straight-line method.
897077_16_ITEM15_P32_S0	Long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, rental equipment, and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
897077_16_ITEM15_P32_S1	If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares non-discounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset group to its carrying amount.
897077_16_ITEM15_P32_S2	If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an non-discounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds fair value.
897077_16_ITEM15_P33_S0	Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.
897077_16_ITEM15_P34_S0	Goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of businesses acquired.
897077_16_ITEM15_P34_S1	We test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually, at the reporting unit level, and whenever events or circumstances make it likely that an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell all or a portion of a reporting unit.
897077_16_ITEM15_P34_S2	During the third quarter of 2015, the Company changed its annual goodwill and intangible assets impairment testing date from December 31 to October 1.
897077_16_ITEM15_P34_S3	Management considers this accounting change preferable because it allows the Company additional time to complete the annual goodwill test.
897077_16_ITEM15_P34_S4	This change does not accelerate, delay, avoid, or cause an impairment charge, nor does this change result in adjustments to previously issued financial statements.
897077_16_ITEM15_P35_S0	We perform our annual goodwill and intangible assets impairment test and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis.
897077_16_ITEM15_P36_S0	Goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing a qualitative assessment or a two-step process.
897077_16_ITEM15_P36_S1	We have an option to make a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit's goodwill and intangible assets for impairment.
897077_16_ITEM15_P36_S2	If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary.
897077_16_ITEM15_P37_S0	For reporting units where we perform the two-step process, the first step requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill and intangible assets.
897077_16_ITEM15_P37_S1	If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill and intangible assets are not considered impaired.
897077_16_ITEM15_P37_S2	If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, there is an indication that an impairment may exist and the second step is required.
897077_16_ITEM15_P38_S0	In step two, the implied fair value of goodwill and intangible assets are calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities.
897077_16_ITEM15_P38_S1	If the implied fair value of goodwill and intangible assets are less than the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill, the difference is recognized as an impairment loss.
897077_16_ITEM15_P39_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis.
897077_16_ITEM15_P39_S1	This analysis requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates.
897077_16_ITEM15_P39_S2	The cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of time, which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to an even higher degree of uncertainty.
897077_16_ITEM15_P39_S3	The Company also utilizes market valuation models and other financial ratios, which require the Company to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to its assets and businesses.
897077_16_ITEM15_P40_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , goodwill was $ 75,509,000 , which represents 13% of total assets.
897077_16_ITEM15_P41_S0	The Company recognized no goodwill impairment in 2015 , 2014 , or 2013 .
897077_16_ITEM15_P41_S1	During the 2015 impairment analysis review, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 15% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit as of October 1, 2015 would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any of the reporting units.
897077_16_ITEM15_P42_S0	Management believes that the estimated valuations it arrived at are reasonable and consistent with what other marketplace participants would use in valuing the Company's components.
897077_16_ITEM15_P42_S1	However, management cannot give any assurance that these market values will not change in the future.
897077_16_ITEM15_P42_S2	For example, if discount rates demanded by the market increase, this could lead to reduced valuations under the income approach.
897077_16_ITEM15_P43_S0	are not achieved in the future, this could lead management to reassess their assumptions and lead to reduced valuations under the income approach.
897077_16_ITEM15_P43_S1	If the market price of the Company's stock decreases, this could cause the Company to reassess the reasonableness of the implied control premium, which might cause management to assume a higher discount rate under the income approach which could lead to reduced valuations.
897077_16_ITEM15_P43_S2	If future similar transactions exhibit lower multiples than those observed in the past, this could lead to reduced valuations under the similar transactions approach.
897077_16_ITEM15_P43_S3	And finally, if there is a general decline in the stock market and particularly in those companies selected as comparable to the Company's components, this could lead to reduced valuations under the public company market multiple approach.
897077_16_ITEM15_P44_S0	The Company's annual impairment test is performed during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.
897077_16_ITEM15_P44_S1	Given the current market conditions and continued economic uncertainty, the fair value of the Company's components could deteriorate which could result in the need to record impairment charges in future periods.
897077_16_ITEM15_P44_S2	The Company also monitors potential triggering events including changes in the business climate in which it operates, attrition of key personnel, volatility in the capital markets, the Company's market capitalization compared to its book value, the Company's recent operating performance, and the Company's financial projections.
897077_16_ITEM15_P44_S3	The occurrence of one or more triggering events could require additional impairment testing, which could result in future impairment charges.
897077_16_ITEM15_P45_S0	See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding goodwill.
897077_16_ITEM15_P46_S0	The Company has intangible assets with both definite and indefinite useful lives.
897077_16_ITEM15_P46_S1	The definite-lived assets are trade names and trademarks, customer and dealer relationships, and patents and drawings that are subject to amortization with useful lives ranging from 12 years to 25 years.
897077_16_ITEM15_P46_S2	The net book value of these assets at December 31, 2015 was $47,450,000 and $51,484,000 at December 31, 2014 .
897077_16_ITEM15_P47_S0	The indefinite-lived assets not subject to amortization consist of trade names.
897077_16_ITEM15_P47_S1	The net book value of these trade names was $5,500,000 as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 .
897077_16_ITEM15_P47_S2	This consisted of the Gradall trade name with a carrying value of $3,600,000 and the Bush Hog trade name with a carrying value of $1,900,000 .
897077_16_ITEM15_P48_S0	The Company tests its indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis at year-end, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset could be below its carrying amount.
897077_16_ITEM15_P48_S1	The impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, determined using the relief from royalty method, with its carrying amount.
897077_16_ITEM15_P48_S2	An impairment loss would be recognized for the carrying amount in excess of its fair value.
897077_16_ITEM15_P49_S0	The Company records annual amounts relating to its pension and post-retirement plans based on calculations that incorporate various actuarial and other assumptions, including discount rates, mortality, assumed rates of return, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates.
897077_16_ITEM15_P49_S1	The Company reviews its assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is appropriate to do so.
897077_16_ITEM15_P49_S2	The effect of modifications to those assumptions is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized to net periodic cost over future periods using the corridor method.
897077_16_ITEM15_P49_S3	The Company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on its experience and market conditions.
897077_16_ITEM15_P50_S0	The net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn the post-retirement benefits.
897077_16_ITEM15_P51_S0	There were no reportable relationships or related party transactions for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 .
897077_16_ITEM15_P52_S0	The Company recognizes revenue when each of the following four criteria are met: 1) a contract or sales arrangement exists; 2) products have been shipped per agreed terms and title has been transferred or services have been rendered; 3) the prices of the products or services are fixed or determinable; and 4) collectability is reasonably assured.
897077_16_ITEM15_P53_S0	Pre-season sales orders are solicited in the fall in advance of the dealer s sales season in the spring and summer.
897077_16_ITEM15_P53_S1	Pre-season sales orders are shipped beginning in the fall and continuing through the spring and represent an opportunity for the Company s factories to level their production/shipping volumes through the winter months.
897077_16_ITEM15_P53_S2	These pre-season shipments carry descending discounts in conjunction with delayed payment terms of up to six months from the dealer s requested delivery date.
897077_16_ITEM15_P54_S0	Revenue from sales is recorded net of a provision for discounts that are anticipated to be earned and deducted at time of payment by the customer.
897077_16_ITEM15_P54_S1	These approximated discounts are estimated using an average of historical discounts taken and are adjusted as program terms are changed.
897077_16_ITEM15_P54_S2	The reserves for discounts are reviewed and adjusted quarterly.
897077_16_ITEM15_P55_S0	The Company enters into operating lease agreements with customers related to the rental of certain equipment.
897077_16_ITEM15_P55_S1	The rental income is recognized ratably over the term of the leases.
897077_16_ITEM15_P55_S2	Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.
897077_16_ITEM15_P56_S0	The Company enters into operating lease agreements with customers related to the rental of certain equipment.
897077_16_ITEM15_P56_S1	In accounting for these leases, the cost of the equipment purchased or manufactured by the Company is recorded as an asset, and is depreciated over its estimated useful life.
897077_16_ITEM15_P56_S2	Accumulated depreciation relating to the rental equipment was $8,322,000 and $3,435,000 on of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 .
897077_16_ITEM15_P57_S0	The Company s policy is to include shipping and handling costs in costs of goods sold.
897077_16_ITEM15_P58_S0	We charge advertising costs to expense as incurred.
897077_16_ITEM15_P58_S1	Advertising and marketing expense related to operations for fiscal years 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 was approximately $ 7,670,000 , $ 7,368,000 and $ 6,646,000 , respectively.
897077_16_ITEM15_P58_S2	Advertising and marketing expenses are included in Selling, General and Administrative expenses ( SG A ).
897077_16_ITEM15_P59_S0	Product development and engineering costs charged to SG A amounted to $ 8,590,000 , $ 8,427,000 , and $ 7,164,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively.
897077_16_ITEM15_P60_S0	Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
897077_16_ITEM15_P60_S1	The Company's policy is to accrue for legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with loss contingencies.
897077_16_ITEM15_P61_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and are measured by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to the future years in which deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized.
897077_16_ITEM15_P62_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.
897077_16_ITEM15_P62_S1	The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.
897077_16_ITEM15_P62_S2	Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, available tax carrybacks and tax planning strategies in making this assessment other than those which we have reserved.
897077_16_ITEM15_P62_S3	Based upon projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences.
897077_16_ITEM15_P63_S0	We do not provide for a U.S. income tax liability on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.
897077_16_ITEM15_P63_S1	The earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, which reflect full provision for non-U.S. income taxes, are currently indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. operations.
897077_16_ITEM15_P64_S0	The Company has granted options to purchase its common stock to certain employees and directors of the Company and its affiliates under various stock option plans at no less than the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant.
897077_16_ITEM15_P64_S1	These options are granted for a term not exceeding ten years and are forfeited in the event the employee or director terminates his or her employment or relationship with the Company or one of its affiliates other than by retirement or death.
897077_16_ITEM15_P64_S2	These options generally vest over five years.
897077_16_ITEM15_P65_S0	All option plans contain anti-dilutive provisions that permit an adjustment of the number of shares of the Company s common stock represented by each option for any change in capitalization.
897077_16_ITEM15_P65_S1	Excess tax benefits or awards that are recognized in equity related to stock option exercises are reflected as cash flows from financing activities in the statement of cash flows.
897077_16_ITEM15_P66_S0	The fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation method with the following assumptions noted:
897077_16_ITEM15_P67_S0	The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rate over the expected life of the option at the time of the grant.
897077_16_ITEM15_P68_S0	The dividend yield is calculated as the ratio of dividends paid per share of common stock to the stock price on the date of the grant.
897077_16_ITEM15_P68_S1	The expected volatility factors are based on the historical movement of the Company s common stock price over the expected life of the option.
897077_16_ITEM15_P68_S2	The expected life is the average length of time in which officers, other employees, and non-employee directors are expected to exercise their options, and which are primarily based on historical experience.
897077_16_ITEM15_P69_S0	The Company calculated the fair value for options with the following weighted-average assumptions for 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 :
897077_16_ITEM15_P70_S0	Basic EPS is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year.
897077_16_ITEM15_P70_S1	The treasury stock method is used to compute diluted EPS which gives effect to the potential dilution of earnings that could have occurred if additional shares were issued for awards granted under the Company s incentive stock option plans.
897077_16_ITEM15_P71_S0	The treasury stock method assumes proceeds that would be obtained upon exercise of awards granted under the incentive stock option plans are used to purchase outstanding common stock at the average market price during the period.
897077_16_ITEM15_P72_S0	Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
897077_16_ITEM15_P73_S0	There is a three-tier fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs used in valuation techniques.
897077_16_ITEM15_P73_S1	Observable inputs (highest level) reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs (lowest level) reflect internally developed market assumptions.
897077_16_ITEM15_P73_S2	In fair value, measurements are classified under the following hierarchy:
897077_16_ITEM15_P74_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
897077_16_ITEM15_P74_S1	Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs or significant value-drivers are observable in active markets.
897077_16_ITEM15_P74_S2	Level 3 Model-derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs or significant value-drivers are unobservable.
897077_16_ITEM15_P75_S0	The Company uses quoted market prices, when available, to determine fair value, and the Company classifies such measurements within Level 1.
897077_16_ITEM15_P75_S1	In some cases where market prices are not available, the Company makes use of observable market-based inputs to calculate fair value, in which case the measurements are classified with Level 2.
897077_16_ITEM15_P76_S0	If quoted or observable market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that use, where possible, current market-based parameters such as interest rates, yield curves, currency rates, etc.
897077_16_ITEM15_P76_S1	These measurements are classified within Level 3.
897077_16_ITEM15_P77_S0	The carrying values of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses, approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these items.
897077_16_ITEM15_P77_S1	The carrying value of our debt approximates the fair value as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , as the floating rates on our outstanding balances approximate current market rates.
897077_16_ITEM15_P78_S0	This conclusion was made based on Level 2 inputs.
897077_16_ITEM15_P79_S0	On March 9, 2015, the Company acquired Herder Implementos e Maquinas Agricolas Ltda.
897077_16_ITEM15_P79_S1	("Herder") on a debt free basis for a total consideration of approximately $4.0 million subject to certain post-closing adjustments.
897077_16_ITEM15_P79_S2	This acquisition is being accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 805 Business Combinations ( ASC Topic 805 ).
897077_16_ITEM15_P79_S3	Accordingly, the total purchase price has been allocated on a preliminary basis to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date.
897077_16_ITEM15_P79_S4	These allocations reflect provisional estimates that were available at the time and are subject to change during the measurement period as valuations are finalized.
897077_16_ITEM15_P79_S5	The primary reason for the Herder acquisition was to establish a presence in South America which is a major global agricultural market; therefore, Herder will be reported as part of the Company's Agricultural Division.
897077_16_ITEM15_P80_S0	The revenue and earnings of Herder from the date of acquisition to December 31, 2015 were not material to the Company s consolidated results of operations.
897077_16_ITEM15_P80_S1	In addition, assuming the acquisition had occurred as of January 1, 2014, the results of operations of Herder would not have had a material pro forma effect on the Company s revenues, earnings or earnings per share for the periods ended December 31, 2015.
897077_16_ITEM15_P81_S0	On May 13, 2014 the "Closing Date", the Company acquired all of the operating units of Specialized Industries LP, a portfolio company of ELB Capital Management, LLC.
897077_16_ITEM15_P81_S1	P. Fairfield LLC as well as several related entities (" Specialized "), including all brand names and related product names and trademarks pursuant to the terms of the Membership Interests and Partnership Interests Purchase Agreement dated February 24, 2014.
897077_16_ITEM15_P81_S2	The purchase price consideration was $193 million , on a debt-free basis which included certain post-closing adjustments that were made within 90 days from the acquisition date per the agreement.
897077_16_ITEM15_P82_S0	In connection with the Specialized acquisition on May 13, 2014, the Company amended its revolving credit facility and increased its line of credit from $100 million to $250 million .
897077_16_ITEM15_P82_S1	The Company financed the acquisition through $190 million of new borrowings under the amended credit facility.
897077_16_ITEM15_P83_S0	The Specialized acquisition was accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 805.
897077_16_ITEM15_P83_S1	Accordingly, the total purchase price has been allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the Acquisition, based on their fair values as of May 12, 2014.
897077_16_ITEM15_P84_S0	During Q2 2015, the Company completed its valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities.
897077_16_ITEM15_P85_S0	In connection with preparing information needed for the associated tax returns, the Company identified an error in the pre-acquisition financial statements of Specialized Industries.
897077_16_ITEM15_P85_S1	In particular, a previously unrecognized deferred tax liability approximating $3.3 million related to intangible assets was identified.
897077_16_ITEM15_P86_S0	purchase price allocation disclosed in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.
897077_16_ITEM15_P86_S1	The Company adjusted the purchase price allocation associated with the Specialized acquisition to record the $3.3 million deferred tax liability with an associated increase in goodwill.
897077_16_ITEM15_P86_S2	Pursuant to ASC 805-10-25-17, this adjustment has been reflected as of the acquisition date, and accordingly, the recorded amounts for deferred income tax liabilities and goodwill in the December 31, 2014 financial statements included herein have been adjusted to reflect the revised amounts.
897077_16_ITEM15_P86_S3	The final amounts assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Specialized acquisition were recognized at their acquisition-date fair values and are as follows (in thousands):
897077_16_ITEM15_P87_S0	Intangible assets determined to be definite-lived assets and are broken down as follows:
897077_16_ITEM15_P88_S0	The valuation did not identify indefinite-lived assets during the analysis.
897077_16_ITEM15_P89_S0	This allocation resulted in goodwill of $44.6 million , all of which has been assigned to the Company's Industrial reporting segment.
897077_16_ITEM15_P89_S1	$31.5 million of goodwill is tax deductible.
897077_16_ITEM15_P90_S0	The recognized goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies in both the vacuum truck and snow removal product lines.
897077_16_ITEM15_P91_S0	Under ASC Topic 805-10, acquisition related costs (i.e., advisory, legal, valuation and other professional fees) are not included as a component of consideration transferred, but are accounted for as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred.
897077_16_ITEM15_P91_S1	The Company incurred $1.8 million of acquisition related costs, which have been recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of income.
897077_16_ITEM15_P92_S0	In the period between the Acquisition Date and December 31, 2014, the Specialized business units generated approximately $107.4 million of net sales and $5.1 million of net income.
897077_16_ITEM15_P92_S1	The Company has included the operating results of Specialized in its consolidated financial statements since the Acquisition Date.
897077_16_ITEM15_P93_S0	The following table sets forth the reconciliation from basic to diluted average common shares and the calculations of net income per common share.
897077_16_ITEM15_P93_S1	Net income for basic and diluted calculations does not differ.
897077_16_ITEM15_P94_S0	Stock options totaling 61,690 shares in 2015 , 37,261 shares in 2014 , and 3,831 shares in 2013 were not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
897077_16_ITEM15_P95_S0	4. VALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS Valuation and qualifying accounts included the following:
897077_16_ITEM15_P96_S0	The Company evaluates the collectability of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors.
897077_16_ITEM15_P96_S1	In circumstances where it is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations, the Company records a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what it believes will be collected.
897077_16_ITEM15_P97_S0	The Company evaluates all receivables that are over 60 days old and will reserve specifically on a 90 -day basis.
897077_16_ITEM15_P98_S0	The Company has a secured or insured interest on most of its wholegoods that each customer purchases.
897077_16_ITEM15_P98_S1	This allows the Company, in times of a difficult economy when the customer is unable to pay or has filed for bankruptcy, to repossess its inventory.
897077_16_ITEM15_P98_S2	This also allows Alamo Group in certain instances, to maintain only a reserve over its cost, which usually represents the margin on the original sales price.
897077_16_ITEM15_P99_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $ 3,484,000 on December 31, 2015 , and $ 2,853,000 on December 31, 2014 .
897077_16_ITEM15_P99_S1	The increase was primarily from the Company's U.S. operations.
897077_16_ITEM15_P100_S0	On December 31, 2015 , the Company had $ 15,094,000 in reserves for sales discounts compared to $ 15,999,000 on December 31, 2014 on product shipped to our customers under various promotional programs.
897077_16_ITEM15_P100_S1	The decrease was due primarily to lower sales volume of the Company s agricultural products during the 2014 pre-season, which runs during the third and fourth quarters of each year with orders shipped through the second quarter of 2015.
897077_16_ITEM15_P101_S0	The Company reviews the reserve quarterly based on analysis made on each program outstanding at the time.
897077_16_ITEM15_P102_S0	The Company bases its reserves on historical data relating to discounts taken by the customer under each program.
897077_16_ITEM15_P102_S1	Historically, between 90% and 95% of the Company s customers who qualify for each program actually take the discount that is available.
897077_16_ITEM15_P103_S0	The Company had a reserve of $ 9,675,000 on December 31, 2015 and $ 7,601,000 on December 31, 2014 to cover obsolete and slow moving inventory.
897077_16_ITEM15_P103_S1	The increase in the reserve was mainly from the Company's Industrial Division.
897077_16_ITEM15_P104_S0	The obsolete and slow moving inventory policy states that the reserve is to be calculated as follows: 1) no inventory usage over a three -year period is deemed obsolete and reserved at 100 percent ; and 2) slow moving inventory with little usage requires a 100 percent reserve on items that have a quantity greater than a three -year supply.
897077_16_ITEM15_P104_S1	There are exceptions to the obsolete and slow moving classifications if approved by an officer of the Company, based on specific identification of an item or items that are deemed to be either included or excluded from this classification.
897077_16_ITEM15_P104_S2	In cases where there is no historical data, management makes a judgment based on a specific review of the inventory in question to determine what reserves, if any, are appropriate.
897077_16_ITEM15_P104_S3	New products or parts are generally excluded from the reserve policy until a three -year history has been established.
897077_16_ITEM15_P105_S0	The Company s warranty policy is generally to provide its customers warranty for up to one year on all wholegood units and 90 days on parts, though some components can have warranty for longer terms.
897077_16_ITEM15_P106_S0	Warranty reserve, as a percentage of sales, is generally calculated by looking at the current twelve months expenses and prorating that amount based on twelve months sales with a ninety -day to six -month lag period.
897077_16_ITEM15_P106_S1	The Company s historical experience is that an end-user takes approximately 90 days to six months from the receipt of the unit to file a warranty claim.
897077_16_ITEM15_P106_S2	A warranty reserve is established for each different marketing group.
897077_16_ITEM15_P106_S3	Reserve balances are evaluated on a quarterly basis and adjustments made when required.
897077_16_ITEM15_P107_S0	The current liability warranty reserve balance was $ 5,566,000 on December 31, 2015 and $ 5,913,000 on December 31, 2014 and are included in Note 9.
897077_16_ITEM15_P107_S1	The decrease was primarily in the Company's U.S. operations.
897077_16_ITEM15_P108_S0	Inventories valued at LIFO represented 45% and 37% of total inventory for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
897077_16_ITEM15_P108_S1	The excess of current costs over LIFO-valued inventories was $ 8,712,000 and $ 10,230,000 on December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 , respectively.
897077_16_ITEM15_P108_S2	Inventories consisted of the following on a cost basis, net of reserves:
897077_16_ITEM15_P109_S0	PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment consist of the following:
897077_16_ITEM15_P110_S0	Property, plant and equipment on December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 include capital leases in the amount of $ 182,000 and $ 412,000 , respectively, which are included in the listings above.
897077_16_ITEM15_P110_S1	Accumulated depreciation relating to the capital leases on December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $ 92,000 and $ 308,000 , respectively.
897077_16_ITEM15_P110_S2	Amortization related to the capital lease is included in depreciation expense.
897077_16_ITEM15_P110_S3	The decrease in capital leases in 2015 was due to the purchase of previously leased property.
897077_16_ITEM15_P111_S0	The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 , 2014 , and 2015 are as follows:
897077_16_ITEM15_P112_S0	The following is a summary of both the Company's definite and indefinite-lived intangible assets net of the accumulated amortization:
897077_16_ITEM15_P113_S0	The Company's net carrying value at December 31, 2015 of intangible assets with definite useful lives consists of trade names and trademarks at $20,452,000 , customer and dealer relationships at $25,360,000 and patents and drawings at $1,638,000 .
897077_16_ITEM15_P113_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , the related accumulated amortization balance for the definite lived assets were $1,427,000 for trade names and trademarks, $3,354,000 for customer and dealer relationships, and $255,000 for Patents and drawings.
897077_16_ITEM15_P113_S2	The Company estimates amortization expense to be $3,176,000 for each of the next five years.
897077_16_ITEM15_P114_S0	ACCRUED LIABILITIES Accrued liabilities consist of the following balances:
897077_16_ITEM15_P115_S0	LONG-TERM DEBT The components of long-term debt are as follows:
897077_16_ITEM15_P116_S0	Effective May 12, 2014, the Company amended its revolving credit facility and increased its line of credit from $100,000,000 to $250,000,000 to accommodate the acquisition of the Specialized business units and meet the ongoing needs of the combined entities.
897077_16_ITEM15_P117_S0	The Company maintains an unsecured revolving credit facility with certain lenders under its Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement ("Agreement").
897077_16_ITEM15_P117_S1	The aggregate commitments from lenders under this Agreement are $250,000,000 and, subject to certain conditions, the Company has the option to request an increase in aggregate commitments of up to an additional $50,000,000 .
897077_16_ITEM15_P117_S2	The Agreement requires us to maintain various financial covenants including a minimum earnings before interest and tax to interest expense ratio, a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum asset coverage ratio.
897077_16_ITEM15_P117_S3	The Agreement also contains various covenants relating to limitations on indebtedness, limitations on investments and acquisitions, limitations on sale of properties, and limitations on liens and capital expenditures.
897077_16_ITEM15_P117_S4	The Agreement also contains other customary covenants, representations and events of defaults.
897077_16_ITEM15_P117_S5	The expiration date of the revolving credit facility is May 12, 2019 .
897077_16_ITEM15_P117_S6	As of December 31, 2015 , $144,000,000 was outstanding under the Agreement.
897077_16_ITEM15_P117_S7	On December 31, 2015 , $2,303,000 of the revolver capacity was committed to irrevocable standby letters of credit issued in the ordinary course of business as required by vendors' contracts resulting in $103,697,000 in available borrowings.
897077_16_ITEM15_P117_S8	As of December 31, 2015 , the Company is in compliance with the terms and conditions of the Agreement.
897077_16_ITEM15_P118_S0	The aggregate maturities of long-term debt, as of December 31, 2015 , are as follows: $ 60,000 in 2016 ; zero in 2017 and 2018 ; $144,000,000 in 2019 and zero thereafter.
897077_16_ITEM15_P119_S0	The fair value of the Company s debt is based on secondary market indicators.
897077_16_ITEM15_P119_S1	Since the Company s debt is not quoted, estimates are based on each obligation s characteristics, including remaining maturities, interest rate, credit rating, collateral, amortization schedule and liquidity.
897077_16_ITEM15_P119_S2	The carrying value of our debt approximates the fair value as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , as the floating rates on our outstanding balances approximate current market rates.
897077_16_ITEM15_P120_S0	This conclusion was made based on Level 2 inputs.
897077_16_ITEM15_P121_S0	Fair value measurements are classified to the lowest level input or value-driver that is significant to the valuation.
897077_16_ITEM15_P121_S1	A measurement may therefore be classified within Level 3 even though there may be significant inputs that are readily observable.
897077_16_ITEM15_P122_S0	The Company does not currently have any assets or liabilities that are recognized and measured on a fair value basis.
897077_16_ITEM15_P122_S1	Fair value measurements are also used in connection with nonrecurring valuations performed in connection with impairment assessments and acquisition accounting.
897077_16_ITEM15_P123_S0	In completing the analysis of the fair values of certain of the acquired assets in the current year acquisitions, discounted cash flow models were used, which were principally based upon internal assumptions.
897077_16_ITEM15_P123_S1	In valuing certain of the acquired intangible assets we used an excess earnings methodology, which is a form of a discounted cash flow analysis.
897077_16_ITEM15_P124_S0	Tangible assets were valued using a replacement or reproduction cost approach, considering factors such as current prices of the same or similar equipment, the age of the equipment and economic obsolescence.
897077_16_ITEM15_P125_S0	The implied value of goodwill is determined by allocating the acquisition cost to all of the assets and liabilities of the acquired entity, with the residual amount allocated to goodwill.
897077_16_ITEM15_P126_S0	All of our nonrecurring valuations use significant unobservable inputs and therefore fall under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
897077_16_ITEM15_P127_S0	The jurisdictional components of income before taxes consist of the following:
897077_16_ITEM15_P128_S0	The components of income tax expense (benefit) consist of the following:
897077_16_ITEM15_P129_S0	The difference between income tax expense (benefit) for financial statement purposes and the amount of income tax expense computed by applying the domestic statutory income tax rate of 35% to income before income taxes consist of the following:
897077_16_ITEM15_P130_S0	Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis.
897077_16_ITEM15_P130_S1	The components of the Company s deferred income tax assets and liabilities consist of the following:
897077_16_ITEM15_P131_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had foreign deferred tax assets consisting of foreign net operating losses and other tax benefits available to reduce future taxable income in a foreign jurisdiction.
897077_16_ITEM15_P131_S1	These foreign jurisdictions net operating loss carryforwards are in the approximate amount of $7,400,000 with an unlimited carryforward period, and $1,700,000 with a carry forward expiring in 2035.
897077_16_ITEM15_P131_S2	The Company also has U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards in the amount of $100,000 which will expire between 2015 to 2028.
897077_16_ITEM15_P132_S0	The company recorded a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 due to uncertainties related to the ability to utilize some of the deferred income tax assets, primarily consisting of certain U.S. state NOLs and income tax credits, and international NOLs, before they expire.
897077_16_ITEM15_P132_S1	The valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which deferred income tax assets will be recoverable.
897077_16_ITEM15_P132_S2	The realization of net deferred income tax assets recorded as of December 31, 2015 is primarily dependent upon the ability to generate future taxable income in certain U.S. states and international jurisdictions.
897077_16_ITEM15_P133_S0	Deferred income taxes have not been provided on the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases of the Company s foreign subsidiaries, based on the determination that such differences are essentially permanent in duration in that the earnings of the subsidiaries are expected to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations.
897077_16_ITEM15_P133_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , the cumulative undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries approximated $ 162,526,000 .
897077_16_ITEM15_P133_S2	If these earnings were not considered indefinitely reinvested, deferred income taxes would have been recorded after the consideration of foreign tax credits.
897077_16_ITEM15_P133_S3	At this time, it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional income taxes that might be payable on those earnings, if distributed.
897077_16_ITEM15_P134_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires that the net of deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current on the balance sheet by jurisdiction rather than being separately presented as current and non-current portions.
897077_16_ITEM15_P134_S1	We are required to adopt the new standard beginning with our first quarterly filing in 2017; however, early adoption is permitted and the standard may be applied either retrospectively or on a prospective basis to all deferred tax assets and liabilities.
897077_16_ITEM15_P134_S2	On December 31, 2015, we elected to early adopt ASU No. 2015-17 prospectively, thus reclassifying $6,500,000 of current deferred tax assets and $300,000 of current deferred tax liabilities to non-current on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
897077_16_ITEM15_P134_S3	The prior reporting period was not retrospectively adjusted.
897077_16_ITEM15_P135_S0	The Company adopted the provisions of FASB ASC Section 740-10-25 (formerly FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes ) on January 1, 2007.
897077_16_ITEM15_P135_S1	Unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of $301,000 and $388,000 for 2015 and 2014 , respectively, are included in other non-current liabilities on the balance sheet.
897077_16_ITEM15_P135_S2	The unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would favorably impact our effective tax rate in a future period.
897077_16_ITEM15_P135_S3	We do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits disclosed above to change significantly over the next 12 months.
897077_16_ITEM15_P136_S0	The Company adopted the policy to include interest and penalty expense related to income taxes as interest and other expense, respectively.
897077_16_ITEM15_P136_S1	As of December 31, 2015, $36,000 of interest and penalties have been accrued.
897077_16_ITEM15_P136_S2	We operate in multiple tax jurisdictions, both inside and outside the United States and are currently under audit by certain state and foreign tax authorities.
897077_16_ITEM15_P136_S3	In general, the tax years 2012 through 2015 remain open in the major taxing jurisdictions, with some state and foreign jurisdictions remaining open longer, as the result of net operating losses and longer statutes of limitation periods.
897077_16_ITEM15_P137_S0	The Company was authorized by its Board of Directors in 1997 to repurchase up to 1,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock to be funded through working capital and credit facility borrowings.
897077_16_ITEM15_P137_S1	No shares were repurchased in 2015 or 2014 under this authorization.
897077_16_ITEM15_P137_S2	The authorization to repurchase up to 1,000,000 shares was revoked by the Board of Directors on August 6, 2015.
897077_16_ITEM15_P138_S0	On September 24, 2014, the Company was authorized by its Board of Directors to enter into a Share Repurchase Agreement with Capital Southwest Corporation and Capital Southwest Venture Corporation ( Capital Southwest ).
897077_16_ITEM15_P138_S1	Pursuant to the Repurchase Agreement, the Company repurchased 849,690 shares of the Company s common stock owned by Capital Southwest at a purchase price of $40.255 per share .
897077_16_ITEM15_P138_S2	The closing price of the Company s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on September 24, 2014 was $41.50 per share.
897077_16_ITEM15_P138_S3	The Company financed the repurchase through borrowings under its revolving credit facility.
897077_16_ITEM15_P138_S4	The Company completed the transaction on September 25, 2014 and subsequently retired all 849,690 shares.
897077_16_ITEM15_P138_S5	In November 2014, the Company successfully completed a public offering of our shares on behalf of Capital Southwest Corporation.
897077_16_ITEM15_P139_S0	On January 4, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.09 per share which was paid on January 29, 2016 to holders of record as of January 15, 2016.

897077_16_ITEM15_P156_S1	The measurement dates of the assets and liabilities of both plans were December 31 of the respective years presented.
897077_16_ITEM15_P157_S0	The Company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status (i.e., the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations) of defined benefit postretirement plans as an asset or liability in its consolidated balance sheet and recognizes changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur.
897077_16_ITEM15_P157_S1	The Company measures the funded status of a plan as of the date of the year-end consolidated balance sheet.
897077_16_ITEM15_P158_S0	The underfunded status of the plans of $4,499,000 and $5,714,000 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, is recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as long-term accrued pension liability because plan assets are less than the value of benefit obligations expected to be paid.
897077_16_ITEM15_P159_S0	The accumulated benefit obligation for our pension plans represents the actuarial present value of benefits based on employee service and compensation as of a certain date and does not include an assumption about future compensation levels.
897077_16_ITEM15_P160_S0	In determining the projected benefit obligation and the net pension cost, we used the following significant weighted-average assumptions:
897077_16_ITEM15_P161_S0	Assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31:
897077_16_ITEM15_P162_S0	Assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December 31:
897077_16_ITEM15_P163_S0	The Company employs a building block approach in determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
897077_16_ITEM15_P163_S1	Historical markets are studied and long-term historical relationships between equities and fixed income are preserved consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run.
897077_16_ITEM15_P163_S2	Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term market assumptions are determined.
897077_16_ITEM15_P163_S3	The long-term portfolio return is established via a building block approach with proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing.
897077_16_ITEM15_P163_S4	Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness.
897077_16_ITEM15_P164_S0	The following tables present the components of net periodic benefit cost (gains are denoted with parentheses and losses are not):
897077_16_ITEM15_P165_S0	The Company estimates that $ 724,000 of unrecognized actuarial expense will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic benefit costs during 2016 .
897077_16_ITEM15_P166_S0	The Company employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk.
897077_16_ITEM15_P166_S1	Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condition.
897077_16_ITEM15_P167_S0	The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income investments.
897077_16_ITEM15_P167_S1	Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks, as well as growth, value, and small and large capitalizations.
897077_16_ITEM15_P167_S2	Other assets such as real estate, private equity, and hedge funds are used judiciously to enhance long-term returns while improving portfolio diversification.
897077_16_ITEM15_P167_S3	Derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely manner; however, derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of the underlying investments.
897077_16_ITEM15_P168_S0	Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements, and periodic asset/liability studies.
897077_16_ITEM15_P169_S0	Our current asset allocations are consistent with our targeted allocations.
897077_16_ITEM15_P170_S0	The pension plans' weighted-average asset allocations as a percentage of plan assets at December 31 are as follows:
897077_16_ITEM15_P171_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , we used the following valuation techniques to measure fair value for assets.
897077_16_ITEM15_P171_S1	There were no changes to these methodologies during 2015 :
897077_16_ITEM15_P172_S0	Level 1 - Assets were valued using the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual security was traded.
897077_16_ITEM15_P172_S1	Level 2 - Assets were valued using quoted prices in markets that are not active, broker dealer quotations, net asset value of shares held by the plans, and other methods by which all significant input was observable at the measurement date.
897077_16_ITEM15_P172_S2	Level 3 - Assets were valued using valuation reports from the respective institutions at the measurement date.
897077_16_ITEM15_P172_S3	The following table presents the hierarchy levels for our postretirement benefit plan investments as of December 31:
897077_16_ITEM15_P173_S0	Our interests in the common collective trust investments are managed by one custodian.
897077_16_ITEM15_P173_S1	Consistent with our investment policy, the custodian has invested the assets across a widely diversified portfolio of U.S. and international equity and fixed income securities.
897077_16_ITEM15_P173_S2	Fair values of each security within the collective trust as of December 31, 2015 were obtained from the custodian and are based on quoted market prices of individual investments; however, since the fund itself does not have immediate liquidity or a quoted market price, these assets are considered Level 2.
897077_16_ITEM15_P174_S0	The common collective funds noted in the above table have estimated fair value using the net asset value per share of investments.
897077_16_ITEM15_P174_S1	Investments can be redeemed immediately at the current net asset value per share based on the fair value of the underlying assets.
897077_16_ITEM15_P175_S0	The categories contain investments in equity securities of smaller growing companies, medium-sized U.S. companies, large value-oriented and growth-oriented companies, and foreign companies traded on international markets.
897077_16_ITEM15_P176_S0	Expected benefit payments are estimated using the same assumptions used in determining our benefit obligation as of December 31, 2015 .
897077_16_ITEM15_P176_S1	The following table illustrates the estimated pension benefit payments that are projected to be paid:
897077_16_ITEM15_P177_S0	The Board of Directors of the Company adopted the Alamo Group Inc. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the SERP ), effective as of January 3, 2011.
897077_16_ITEM15_P177_S1	The SERP will benefit certain key management or other highly compensated employees of the Company and/or certain subsidiaries who are selected by the Compensation Committee and approved by the Board to participate.
897077_16_ITEM15_P178_S0	The SERP is intended to provide a benefit from the Company upon retirement, death or disability, or a change in control of the Company.
897077_16_ITEM15_P178_S1	Accordingly, the SERP obligates the Company to pay to a participant a Retirement Benefit (as defined in the SERP) upon the occurrence of certain payment events to the extent a participant has a vested right thereto.
897077_16_ITEM15_P178_S2	A participant s right to his or her Retirement Benefit becomes vested in the Company s contributions upon 10 years of Credited Service (as defined in the SERP) or a change in control of the Company.
897077_16_ITEM15_P178_S3	The Retirement Benefit is based on 20% of the final three -year average salary of each participant on or after his or her normal retirement age ( 65 years of age).
897077_16_ITEM15_P178_S4	In the event of the participant s death or a change in control, the participant s vested retirement benefit will be paid in a lump sum to the participant or his or her estate, as applicable, within 90 days after the participant s death or a change in control, as applicable.
897077_16_ITEM15_P178_S5	In the event the participant is entitled to a benefit from the SERP due to disability, retirement or other termination of employment, the benefit will be paid in monthly installments over a period of fifteen years.
897077_16_ITEM15_P179_S0	The Company records amounts relating to the SERP based on calculations that incorporate various actuarial and other assumptions, including discount rates, rate of compensation increases, retirement dates and life expectancies.
897077_16_ITEM15_P179_S1	The net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn the SERP benefits.
897077_16_ITEM15_P180_S0	In connection with the initiation of the SERP, the Company had an unfunded long-term liability of $1,964,301 , a deferred tax asset of $746,000 , and $1,218,301 in accumulated other comprehensive income.
897077_16_ITEM15_P180_S1	The $1,964,301 includes prior service cost which will be amortized over the average remaining service periods of the employees.
897077_16_ITEM15_P180_S2	The prior service cost is included as a component of net periodic pension cost.

897077_16_ITEM15_P200_S1	These laws and regulations are constantly changing, and it is impossible to predict with accuracy the effect that changes to such laws and regulations may have on the Company in the future.
897077_16_ITEM15_P201_S0	Like other industrial concerns, the Company s manufacturing operations entail the risk of noncompliance, and there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur material costs or other liabilities as a result thereof.

897077_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	You should carefully consider each of the risks described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision with respect to the Company s securities.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the following risks develop into actual events, the Company s business, financial condition or results from operations could be materially and adversely affected and you could lose all or part of your investment.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Deterioration of industry conditions could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our business depends to a large extent upon the prospects for the mowing, right-of-way maintenance and agricultural markets in general.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Future prospects of the industry depend largely on factors outside of our control.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Any of those factors could adversely impact demand for our products, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	increase in unfunded pension plan liability due to financial market deterioration.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In addition, our business is susceptible to a number of factors that specifically affect agricultural customer spending patterns, including the following:
897077_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	A downturn in general economic conditions and outlook in the United States and around the world could adversely affect our net sales and earnings.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The strength and profitability of our business depends on the overall demand for our products and upon economic conditions and outlook, including but not limited to economic growth rates; consumer spending levels; financing availability, pricing and terms for our dealers and end-users; employment rates; interest rates; inflation; consumer confidence and general economic and political conditions and expectations in the United States and the other economies in which we conduct business.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Slow or negative growth rates, inflationary/deflationary pressures, higher commodity costs and energy prices, reduced credit availability or unfavorable credit terms for our dealers and end-user customers, increased unemployment rates, and recessionary economic conditions and outlook could cause consumers to reduce spending, which may cause them to delay or forgo purchases of our products and could have an adverse effect on our net sales and earnings.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The potential withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union ( Brexit ) and the perceptions as to the impact of the withdrawal may adversely affect business activity, political stability and economic conditions in the U.K., the European Union and elsewhere.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The economic conditions and outlook could be further adversely affected by (i) the uncertainty concerning the timing and terms of the exit, (ii) new or modified trading arrangements between the U.K. and other countries and (iii) the risk that one or more other European Union countries could come under increasing pressure to leave the European Union.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Any of these developments, or the perception that any of these developments are likely to occur, could negatively affect economic growth or business activity in the U.K., the European Union and elsewhere, and could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We depend on governmental sales and a decrease in such sales could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales to federal, state and local governmental entities and related contractors, both in the U.S. and in other countries in which we sell our products.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	These sales depend primarily on the levels of budgeted and appropriated expenditures for highway, airport, roadside and parks maintenance by various governmental entities and are affected by changes in local and national economic conditions.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our dependence on, and the price and availability of, raw materials as well as purchased components may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We are subject to fluctuations in market prices for raw materials such as steel and energy.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In addition, although most of the raw materials and purchased components we use are commercially available from a number of sources, we could experience disruptions in the availability of such materials.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P11_S2	If we are unable to purchase materials we require or are unable to pass on price increases to our customers or otherwise reduce our cost of goods sold, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P11_S3	In addition, higher energy costs could negatively affect spending by farmers, including their purchases of our products.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	This analysis requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	The cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of time, which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to an even higher degree of uncertainty.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P13_S3	The Company also utilizes market valuation models and other financial ratios, which require the Company to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to its assets and businesses.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , goodwill was $ 74,825,000 , which represents 14% of total assets.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The Company recognized no goodwill impairment in 2016 , 2015 or 2014 .
897077_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	During the third quarter of 2015, the Company changed its annual goodwill and intangible assets impairment testing date from December 31 to October 1.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P15_S2	During the 2016 impairment analysis review, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 15% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit as of October 1, 2016 would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any of the reporting units.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We are significantly dependent on information technology.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic and financial information, to manage a variety of business processes and activities, and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	We also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations, personnel, customers, and suppliers.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	These information technology systems (some of which are provided and maintained by third parties) may be susceptible to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to hardware failures, computer viruses, hacker attacks, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophic events or other factors.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P17_S3	If our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience business disruptions, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of customers and sales, causing our product sales, financial condition, and operating results to be adversely affected and the reporting of our financial results to be delayed.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information or other sensitive information of our customers and employees.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Despite the information security measures we have taken, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, disruption of our operations and the services we provide to customers, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We operate in a highly competitive industry, and some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater resources than we do.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our products are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We compete with several large national and international companies that offer a broad range of equipment and replacement parts that compete with our products, as well as with numerous small, privately-held manufacturers and suppliers of a limited number of products mainly on a regional basis.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Some of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater financial and other resources at their disposal.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P20_S3	We believe that we are able to compete successfully in our markets by, to some extent, avoiding direct competition with significantly larger potential competitors.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P20_S4	There can be no assurance that our competitors will not substantially increase the resources devoted to the development and marketing of products competitive with our products or that new competitors with greater resources will not enter our markets.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Any failure to effectively compete could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We operate and source internationally, which exposes us to the political, economic and other risks of doing business abroad.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We have operations in a number of countries outside of the United States and we source raw materials and components globally.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Our international operations are subject to the risks normally associated with conducting business in foreign countries, including but not limited to the following:
897077_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the United States and the other countries in which we operate affecting foreign trade, investment, taxation and our ability to effectively source components and raw materials internationally.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	For example, any significant changes in U.S. trade policy, including the introduction of any new or expanded tariffs, could increase the cost of critical materials and supplies that we source internationally or negatively impact international sales of our products, which would have an adverse effect on our net sales and earnings.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	In addition, political developments and governmental regulations and policies in the countries in which we operate directly affect the demand for our products.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	For example, decreases or delays in farm subsidies to our agricultural customers, or changes in environmental policies aimed at limiting mowing activities, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our acquisition strategy may not be successful, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We intend to grow internally and through the acquisition of businesses and assets that will complement our current businesses.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	To date, a material portion of our growth has come through acquisitions.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P26_S2	We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition targets, obtain financing for acquisitions on satisfactory terms or successfully acquire identified targets.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Competition for acquisition opportunities may also increase our costs of making acquisitions or prevent us from making certain acquisitions.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P26_S4	These and other acquisition-related factors may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We may be unable to complete or integrate existing or future acquisitions effectively, and businesses we have acquired, or may acquire in the future, may not perform as expected.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We may not be successful in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations and achieving projected synergies.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	We could face many risks in integrating acquired businesses, including but not limited to the following:
897077_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	we may encounter unanticipated events, circumstances or legal liabilities.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts from the management of each entity, including coordinating existing business plans and research and development efforts.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Integrating operations may distract management s attention from the day-to-day operation of the combined companies.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Ultimately, our attempts to integrate the operations, technology and personnel of acquired businesses may not be successful.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P30_S3	If we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses, our future results may be negatively impacted.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	In addition, we may be adversely affected if businesses that we have acquired, or that we acquire in the future, do not perform as expected.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	An acquired business could perform below our expectations for a number of reasons, including legislative or regulatory changes that affect the areas in which the acquired business specializes, the loss of customers and dealers, general economic factors that directly affect the acquired business, and the cultural incompatibility of its management team.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Any or all of these reasons could adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The agricultural industry and the infrastructure maintenance industry are seasonal and are affected by the weather, and seasonal fluctuations may cause our results of operations and working capital to fluctuate from quarter to quarter.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	In general, agricultural and governmental end-users typically purchase new equipment during the first and second calendar quarters.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Other products such as street sweepers, excavators, snow removal equipment, front-end loaders and pothole patchers have different seasonal patterns, as do replacement parts in general.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P33_S2	In attempting to achieve efficient utilization of manpower and facilities throughout the year, we estimate seasonal demand months in advance and manufacturing capacity is scheduled in anticipation of such demand.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P33_S3	We utilize an annual plan with updated quarterly sales forecasts provided by our marketing divisions and order backlog in order to develop a production plan for our manufacturing facilities.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P33_S4	In addition, many of our marketing departments attempt to equalize demand for their products throughout the calendar year by offering seasonal sales programs which may provide additional incentives, including discounts and extended payment terms, on equipment that is ordered during off-season periods.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P33_S5	Because we spread our production and wholesale shipments throughout the year to take into account the factors described above, sales in any given period may not reflect the timing of dealer orders and retail demand.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Weather conditions and general economic conditions may affect the timing of purchases and actual industry conditions might differ from our forecasts.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Consequently, sudden or significant declines in industry demand could adversely affect our working capital or results of operations.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	If we do not retain key personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees, our business may suffer.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our continued success will depend on, among other things, the efforts and skills of our executive officers, including our president and chief executive officer, and our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified managerial, technical, manufacturing, and sales and marketing personnel.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P36_S1	We do not maintain key man life insurance for any of our employees, and all of our senior management are employed at will.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P36_S2	We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and hire suitable replacements for any of our key employees.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P36_S3	We believe the loss of a key executive officer or other key employee could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We may not be able to realize the potential or strategic benefits of the acquisitions we complete, or we may not be able to successfully address problems encountered in connection with acquisitions.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Acquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P38_S1	We have completed a number of acquisitions over the past several years.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P38_S2	We expect to consider opportunities and make additional acquisitions in the future, but we may not find suitable acquisition targets or be able to consummate desired acquisitions due to among other things, unfavorable credit markets or other risks, which could harm our operating results.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Acquisitions can be difficult, time-consuming, and pose a number of risks, including:
897077_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	potential negative impact on our relationships with customers, distributors and vendors.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	If we do not manage these risks, the acquisitions that we complete may have an adverse effect on our business, our results of operations, or financial condition.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Increasingly stringent engine emission regulations could impact our ability to sell certain of our products into the market and appropriately price certain of our products, which could negatively affect our competitive position and financial results.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The products we manufacture or sell, particularly engines, are subject to increasingly stringent environmental emissions regulations.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P42_S1	For instance, the EPA has adopted increasingly stringent engine emissions regulations, including Tier 4 emission requirements applicable to diesel engines in specified horsepower ranges that are used in some of our products.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P42_S2	As of January 1, 2012, such requirements expanded to additional horsepower categories and, accordingly, apply to more of the products we sell.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P42_S3	While we have developed and implemented plans to achieve full and timely compliance with these requirements, our ability to meet the Tier 4 requirements is subject to many variables, some of which are beyond our direct control.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P42_S4	If we fail to meet the Tier 4 requirements and any other EPA emission standards that are currently in place or that may be introduced in the future, our ability to sell our products into the market may be limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position and financial results.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We are subject on an ongoing basis to the risk of product liability claims and other litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Like other manufacturers, we are subject to various claims, including product liability claims, arising in the ordinary course of business, and we are a party to various legal proceedings that constitute routine litigation incidental to our business.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P44_S1	We may be exposed to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury, property damage, or both.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P44_S2	We cannot assure you that we will not experience any material product liability losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend the Company against such claims.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P44_S3	While we currently have product liability insurance, we cannot assure you that our product liability insurance coverage will be adequate for any liabilities that may ultimately be incurred or that it will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P44_S4	A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage or a requirement to participate in a product recall may have a materially adverse effect on our business.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We are subject to environmental, health and safety and employment laws and regulations and related compliance expenditures and liabilities.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Like other manufacturers, the Company is subject to a broad range of federal, state, local and foreign laws and requirements, including those concerning air emissions, discharges into waterways, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials, as well as the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances at the Company s facilities and offsite disposal locations, workplace safety and equal employment opportunities.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P46_S1	These laws and regulations are constantly changing, and it is impossible to predict with accuracy the effect that changes to such laws and regulations may have on the Company in the future.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Like other industrial concerns, the Company s manufacturing operations entail the risk of noncompliance, and there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur material costs or other liabilities as a result thereof.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Certain properties of the Company contain asbestos that may have to be remediated over time and it could be additional expense to the Company.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The Company is subject to various other federal, state, and local laws affecting its business, as well as a variety of regulations relating to such matters as working conditions, equal employment opportunities, and product safety.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P49_S1	A variety of state laws regulate the Company s contractual relationships with its dealers, some of which impose restrictive standards on the relationship between the Company and its dealers, including events of default, grounds for termination, non-renewal of dealer contracts, and equipment repurchase requirements.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	If we are unable to comply with the terms of our credit arrangements, especially the financial covenants, our credit arrangements could be terminated.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all of the terms of our credit arrangements, especially the financial covenants.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Our ability to comply with such terms depends on the success of our business and our operating results.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Various risks, uncertainties, and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with the terms of our credit arrangements.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P51_S3	If we were out of compliance with any covenant required by our credit arrangements following any applicable cure periods, the banks could terminate their commitments unless we could negotiate a covenant waiver.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P51_S4	The banks could condition such waiver on amendments to the terms of our credit arrangements that may be unfavorable to us, including, a potential increase to the interest rate we currently pay on outstanding debt under our credit arrangements could increase, which could adversely affect our operating results.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominantly in European countries, Canada and Australia, as a result of the sale of our products in international markets.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P53_S1	While we do enter into foreign exchange contracts to protect against such fluctuations to an extent (primarily in the U.K. market), we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively manage these risks.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, such as a devaluation of the Euro against the U.S. dollar, could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations or financial condition.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Because the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, it may be difficult for you to resell our common stock when desired or at attractive prices.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P55_S0	The trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P55_S1	The closing prices of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange during 2016 ranged from $ 77.60 to $ 49.33 per share, and during 2015 from $ 64.34 to $ 44.30 per share.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Our stock price may fluctuate in response to the risk factors set forth herein and to a number of events and factors, such as quarterly variations in operating and financial results, litigation, changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts, the operating and stock performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us, news reports relating to us or trends in our industry or general economic conditions.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P56_S0	The stock price volatility and trading volume may make it difficult for you to resell your shares of our common stock when desired or at attractive prices.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P57_S0	You may experience dilution of your ownership interests due to the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We may issue shares of our previously authorized and unissued securities which will result in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P58_S1	We are currently authorized to issue 20,000,000 shares of common stock.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P58_S2	On December 31, 2016 , 11,508,105 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding, and there were outstanding options and restricted stock awards totaling an additional 378,841 shares of our common stock.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P58_S3	We also have additional shares available for grant under our 2015 Incentive Stock Option Plan and our 2009 Equity Incentive Plan.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P58_S4	Additional stock option or other compensation plans or amendments to existing plans for employees and directors may be adopted.
897077_17_ITEM1A_P58_S5	Issuance of these shares of common stock may dilute the ownership interests of our then existing stockholders.

897077_17_ITEM7_P1_S4	Sales in the European Division were down 10.3% as sales of products manufactured in the U.K. were negatively affected by soft market conditions and currency translation rates which the Company believed was due, in part, to the uncertainty created by the recent Brexit vote in the U.K.
897077_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	Net Industrial sales were $ 484,088,000 in 2016 compared to $ 498,761,000 in 2015 , a decrease of $ 14,673,000 or 2.9% .

897077_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	The decrease in sales for 2016 compared to 2015 was from the continued softness in the overall agricultural market.

897077_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	Despite lower sales volume, the gross profit increase was due to continuous improvement in production efficiencies as well as lower material costs.
897077_17_ITEM7_P5_S2	Negatively affecting both the gross profit and margin percent during 2015 was $2,740,000 in higher cost of goods sold related to the initial step-up in fair value of inventory in the Specialized business divisions acquired in 2014.

897077_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	The increase in SG A was primarily the result of a $2,889,000 in pension expense related to cumulative actuarial losses related to the closure of the Gradall Hourly Employees' Savings and Investment Plan that had been previously deferred in Other comprehensive income and Deferred taxes.

897077_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	Net Agricultural sales were $208,257,000 in 2015 compared to $214,326,000 in 2014, representing a decrease of $6,069,000 or 2.8%.
897077_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	The decrease in sales for 2015 compared to 2014 was driven by lower commodity prices and reduced farm income that resulted in softer market conditions in the agricultural market.

897077_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	Gross margins for 2015 were $202,448,000 (23.0% of net sales) compared to $189,228,000 (22.6% of net sales) in 2014, an increase of $13,220,000.

897077_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	Net income for 2015 was $43,209,000 compared to $41,151,000 in 2014 due to the factors described above.

897077_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	Capital expenditures were $ 9,711,000 for 2016 , compared to $ 15,479,000 for 2015 which included the purchase of the land and buildings at the Company's Wausau facility in the amount of $4,745,000.
897077_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	The Company expects to fund capital expenditures from operating cash flows or through its revolving credit facility, described below.
897077_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	The Company has $14,502,000 in cash and cash equivalents held by its foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 .
897077_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	The majority of these funds are at our French and Canadian facilities and would not be available for use in the United States without incurring U.S. federal and state tax consequences.
897077_17_ITEM7_P26_S2	The Company plans to use these funds for capital expenditures or acquisitions outside the United States.
897077_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	Net cash provided by operating activities was $ 75,554,000 for 2016 , compared to $ 52,560,000 for 2015 .
897077_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	The increase of cash from operating activities came primarily from changes in accounts receivable and inventory levels in all three Divisions .
897077_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	Net cash used in investing activities was $8,656,000 for 2016 , compared to $14,698,000 for 2015 .
897077_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to lower purchases of property, plant and equipment.
897077_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	Net cash used by financing activities was $ 77,117,000 for 2016 , compared to net cash used of $ 48,196,000 for 2015 .
897077_17_ITEM7_P29_S1	The increase in cash used in financing activities was due to the reduction of outstanding indebtedness under the Company's revolving credit facility.
897077_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	The Company maintains an unsecured revolving credit facility with certain lenders under its Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement ("Agreement").
897077_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	The aggregate commitments from lenders under this Agreement are $250,000,000 and, subject to certain conditions, the Company has the option to request an increase in aggregate commitments of up to an additional $50,000,000 .
897077_17_ITEM7_P30_S2	The Agreement requires us to maintain various financial covenants including a minimum earnings before interest and tax to interest expense ratio, a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum asset coverage ratio.
897077_17_ITEM7_P30_S3	The Agreement also contains various covenants relating to limitations on indebtedness, limitations on investments and acquisitions, limitations on sale of properties, and limitations on liens and capital expenditures.
897077_17_ITEM7_P30_S4	The Agreement also contains other customary covenants, representations and events of defaults.
897077_17_ITEM7_P30_S5	Effective December 20, 2016, the Company amended it's revolving credit facility to extend the termination date, reduce LIBOR interest margin and to modify certain financial and other covenants in order to meet the ongoing needs of the Company's business and to allow for greater flexibility in relation to future acquisitions.
897077_17_ITEM7_P30_S6	The expiration date of the revolving credit facility is December 20, 2021 .
897077_17_ITEM7_P30_S7	As of December 31, 2016 , $70,000,000 was outstanding under the Agreement.
897077_17_ITEM7_P30_S8	On December 31, 2016 , $1,714,000 of the revolver capacity was committed to irrevocable standby letters of credit issued in the ordinary course of business as required by vendors' contracts resulting in $178,286,000 in available borrowings.
897077_17_ITEM7_P30_S9	As of December 31, 2016 , the Company is in compliance with the terms and conditions of the Agreement.
897077_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	Management believes the revolving credit facility and the Company s ability to internally generate funds from operations should be sufficient to meet the Company s cash requirements for the foreseeable future.
897077_17_ITEM7_P31_S1	However, challenges affecting the banking industry and credit markets in general can potentially cause changes to credit availability, which creates a level of uncertainty.
897077_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	The Company believes that inflation generally has not had a material impact on its operations or liquidity.
897077_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	The Company is exposed to the risk that the price of energy, steel and other purchased components may increase and the Company may not be able to increase the price of its products correspondingly.
897077_17_ITEM7_P32_S2	If this occurs, the Company s results of operations would be adversely impacted.
897077_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance.
897077_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
897077_17_ITEM7_P33_S2	The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract.
897077_17_ITEM7_P33_S3	This update is effective as of January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted as of January 1, 2017.
897077_17_ITEM7_P33_S4	This update could impact the timing and amounts of revenue recognized.
897077_17_ITEM7_P33_S5	We are evaluating the effects, if any, that adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet selected a transition approach to implement the standard.
897077_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, as part of its simplification initiative.
897077_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	ASU 2015-11 amends existing guidance for measuring inventories.
897077_17_ITEM7_P34_S2	This amendment will require the Company to measure inventories recorded using the first-in, first-out method at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
897077_17_ITEM7_P34_S3	This amendment does not change the methodology for measuring inventories recorded using the last-in, first-out method.
897077_17_ITEM7_P34_S4	This amendment will be effective prospectively for the Company on January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted.
897077_17_ITEM7_P34_S5	The adoption of the changes will not materially affect our financial position or results of our operations.
897077_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases.
897077_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	This update requires that a lessee recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.
897077_17_ITEM7_P35_S2	For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities.
897077_17_ITEM7_P35_S3	Similar to current guidance, the update continues to differentiate between finance leases and operating leases, however this distinction now primarily relates to differences in the manner of expense recognition over time and in the classification of lease payments in the statement of cash flows.
897077_17_ITEM7_P35_S4	The updated guidance leaves the accounting for leases by lessors largely unchanged from existing GAAP.
897077_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	Entities are required to use a modified retrospective adoption, with certain relief provisions, for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements when adopted.
897077_17_ITEM7_P36_S1	The guidance will become effective for us on January 1, 2019.
897077_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	The impacts that adoption of the ASU is expected to have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures are being evaluated.
897077_17_ITEM7_P37_S1	Additionally, we have not determined the effect of the ASU on our internal control over financial reporting or other changes in business practices and processes.
897077_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation, to simplify the accounting and reporting for employee share-based payments.
897077_17_ITEM7_P38_S1	This amendment involves several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including accounting for income taxes as it pertains to the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized and to the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the statements of income, forfeitures, minimum statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification of 8 excess tax benefits and employee taxes paid in the statement of cash flows.
897077_17_ITEM7_P38_S2	This amendment will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted.
897077_17_ITEM7_P38_S3	An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period.
897077_17_ITEM7_P38_S4	The amendments provide specific transition and disclosure guidance for each provision.
897077_17_ITEM7_P38_S5	The adoption of the changes will not materially affect our financial position or results of our operations.
897077_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, to improve information on credit losses for financial instruments.
897077_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	The ASU replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses.
897077_17_ITEM7_P39_S2	The ASU is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
897077_17_ITEM7_P39_S3	Early adoption is permitted beginning in fiscal years beginning after December 18, 2018.
897077_17_ITEM7_P39_S4	The Company has not yet evaluated the effect the adoption of this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.
897077_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, to address diversity in practice on certain specific cash flow issues.
897077_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	The ASU is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
897077_17_ITEM7_P40_S2	The Company does not expect the adoption to have an effect on the consolidated financial statements.
897077_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	There are currently no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are currently likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition.
897077_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	The following table shows the Company s approximate obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 :
897077_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	Definitions: (A) Long-term debt obligation means a principal payment obligation under long-term borrowings.
897077_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	(B) Interest obligation represents interest due on long-term debt and capital lease obligations.
897077_17_ITEM7_P43_S2	Interest on long-term debt assumes all floating rates of interest remain the same as those in effect at December 31, 2016 .
897077_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	(C) Operating lease obligation means a payment obligation under a lease classified as an operating lease.
897077_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	(D) Purchase obligation means an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the registrant that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions.
897077_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	Critical Accounting Estimates Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ).
897077_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
897077_17_ITEM7_P45_S2	Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
897077_17_ITEM7_P45_S3	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
897077_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the financial statements.
897077_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
897077_17_ITEM7_P46_S2	For further information on the critical accounting policies, see Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
897077_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	Business acquisitions are accounted for by the acquisition method of accounting.
897077_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	Under this method, the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on the fair value at the time of the acquisition.
897077_17_ITEM7_P47_S2	Any excess purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill.
897077_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	We believe the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions; however, these assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur.
897077_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	Tangible assets are typically valued using a replacement or reproduction cost approach, considering factors such as current prices of the same or similar equipment, the age of the equipment, and economic obsolescence.
897077_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	utilized a third-party valuation firm to assist us in the valuation of the acquired intangibles and the resulting allocation of purchase price for the acquisition.
897077_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	The Company evaluates the collectability of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors.
897077_17_ITEM7_P51_S1	In circumstances where it is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations, the Company records a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what it believes will be collected.
897077_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	The Company evaluates all receivables that are over 60 days old and will reserve specifically on a 90-day basis.
897077_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	The Company has a secured or insured interest on most of its wholegoods that each customer purchases.
897077_17_ITEM7_P53_S1	This allows the Company, in times of a difficult economy when the customer is unable to pay or has filed for bankruptcy, to repossess its inventory.
897077_17_ITEM7_P53_S2	This also allows Alamo Group, in certain instances, to maintain only a reserve over its cost, which usually represents the margin on the original sales price.
897077_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $ 2,501,000 on December 31, 2016 , and $ 3,484,000 on December 31, 2015 .
897077_17_ITEM7_P54_S1	The decrease was primarily in the Company's U.S. operations.
897077_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	On December 31, 2016 , the Company had $ 13,488,000 in reserves for sales discounts compared to $ 15,094,000 on December 31, 2015 on product shipped to our customers under various promotional programs.
897077_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	The Company reviews the reserve quarterly based on analysis made on each program outstanding at the time.
897077_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	The Company bases its reserves on historical data relating to discounts taken by the customer under each program.
897077_17_ITEM7_P56_S1	Historically, between 85% and 95% of the Company s customers who qualify for each program actually take the discount that is available.
897077_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	The Company had a reserve of $ 7,262,000 on December 31, 2016 and $ 9,675,000 on December 31, 2015 to cover obsolete and slow moving inventory.
897077_17_ITEM7_P57_S1	The decrease in the reserve was mainly from the Company's Industrial Division.
897077_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	The obsolete and slow moving inventory policy states that the reserve is to be calculated as follows: 1) no inventory usage over a three-year period is deemed obsolete and reserved at 100 percent; and 2) slow moving inventory with little usage requires a 100 percent reserve on items that have a quantity greater than a three-year supply.
897077_17_ITEM7_P58_S1	There are exceptions to the obsolete and slow moving classifications if approved by an officer of the Company, based on specific identification of an item or items that are deemed to be either included or excluded from this classification.
897077_17_ITEM7_P58_S2	In cases where there is no historical data, management makes a judgment based on a specific review of the inventory in question to determine what reserves, if any, are appropriate.
897077_17_ITEM7_P58_S3	New products or parts are generally excluded from the reserve policy until a three-year history has been established.
897077_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	The reserve is reviewed and, if necessary, adjustments are made on a quarterly basis.
897077_17_ITEM7_P59_S1	The Company relies on historical information when available to support its reserve.
897077_17_ITEM7_P59_S2	The Company does not adjust the reserve balance until the inventory is liquidated.
897077_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	The Company s warranty policy is generally to provide its customers warranty for up to one year on all wholegood divisions and 90 days on parts, though some components can have warranty for longer terms.
897077_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	Warranty reserve, as a percentage of sales, is generally calculated by looking at the current twelve months expenses and prorating that amount based on twelve months sales with a ninety-day to six-month lag period.
897077_17_ITEM7_P61_S1	The Company s historical experience is that an end-user takes approximately 90 days to six months from the receipt of the division to file a warranty claim.
897077_17_ITEM7_P61_S2	A warranty reserve is established for each different marketing group.
897077_17_ITEM7_P61_S3	Reserve balances are evaluated on a quarterly basis and adjustments made when required.
897077_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	The current liability warranty reserve balance was $ 5,262,000 on December 31, 2016 and $ 5,566,000 on December 31, 2015 .
897077_17_ITEM7_P62_S1	The decrease was primarily in the Company's U.S. operations.
897077_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
897077_17_ITEM7_P63_S1	Goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level.
897077_17_ITEM7_P63_S2	Definite-lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment at the reporting unit level whenever events or circumstances make it likely that an impairment may have occurred.
897077_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	Reporting units are operating segments or components of operating segments for which discrete financial information is available.
897077_17_ITEM7_P64_S1	To evaluate goodwill, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value.
897077_17_ITEM7_P64_S2	Where the carrying value is greater than the fair value, the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit with any remainder being allocated to goodwill.
897077_17_ITEM7_P64_S3	The implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared to the carrying value of that goodwill to determine whether an impairment loss exists.
897077_17_ITEM7_P64_S4	Any impairment loss is recognized in earnings.
897077_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	We typically measure the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis (income approach) based on assumptions that market participants would apply.
897077_17_ITEM7_P65_S1	Because the business is assumed to continue in perpetuity, the discounted cash flows include a terminal value.
897077_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	Cash flows to perpetuity are forecasted based on projected revenue growth and our planned business strategies in future periods.
897077_17_ITEM7_P66_S1	Examples of planned strategies would include a plant or line expansion at an existing facility; a reduction of working capital at a specific location; and price increases or cost reductions within a reporting unit.
897077_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	The discount rate is based on a reporting unit s targeted weighted-average cost of capital, which is not necessarily the same as our weighted-average cost of capital.
897077_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	We perform our annual quantitative test for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.
897077_17_ITEM7_P68_S1	Based on the quantitative testing performed during 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , we determined that none of the goodwill associated with our reporting units were impaired in any of those years.
897077_17_ITEM7_P68_S2	These reporting units would be most likely affected by changes in the Company s assumptions and estimates.
897077_17_ITEM7_P68_S3	The calculation of fair value could increase or decrease depending on changes in the inputs and assumptions used, such as changes in the reporting unit s future growth rates, discount rates, etc.
897077_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	Impairment exists for definite-lived intangible assets when the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable through non-discounted future cash flows and its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value as typically determined under the income approach.
897077_17_ITEM7_P69_S1	In addition, an intangible asset's expected useful life can increase estimation risk, as longer-lived assets necessarily require longer-term cash flow forecasts.
897077_17_ITEM7_P69_S2	In connection with an impairment evaluation, we also reassess the remaining useful life of the intangible asset and modify it, as appropriate.
897077_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	Impairment exists for indefinite-lived intangible assets that consist of trademarks when the carrying amount of an asset is in excess of its fair value as determined using the royalty relief method.
897077_17_ITEM7_P70_S1	These assumptions and projections underlying the fair value estimates are subject to change and are impacted by our ability to achieve our forecasts and by economic conditions that may impact future results and result in projections not being attained.
897077_17_ITEM7_P70_S2	A change in any of these estimates and assumptions could produce a different fair value, which could have a material impact on our results of operations.
897077_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	Each year we re-evaluate the assumptions used to reflect changes in the business environment.
897077_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding goodwill.
897077_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The Company is exposed to various financial market risks.
897077_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates.
897077_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The Company does not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
897077_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	A portion of the Company s operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities in international jurisdictions.
897077_17_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The Company manufactures its products primarily in the United States, the U.K., France, Canada, Brazil and Australia.
897077_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	but certain of the Company s sales from its U.K. and Canadian operations are denominated in other currencies.
897077_17_ITEM7A_P3_S1	As a result, the Company s financials, specifically the value of its foreign assets, could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the U.K. and Canada or weak economic conditions in the other markets in which the subsidiaries of the Company distribute their products.
897077_17_ITEM7A_P4_S0	To mitigate the short-term effect of changes in currency exchange rates on the Company s functional currency-based sales, the Company s U.K. and Canadian subsidiaries regularly enter into foreign exchange contracts for over 90% of their future net foreign currency cash receipts over a period of six months.
897077_17_ITEM7A_P4_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , the Company had a notional amount of $ 1,384,000 in outstanding forward exchange contracts related to accounts receivable.
897077_17_ITEM7A_P4_S2	A 15% fluctuation in exchange rates for these currencies would change the fair value by approximately $ 208,000 .
897077_17_ITEM7A_P4_S3	However, since these contracts offset foreign currency denominated transactions, any change in the fair value of the contracts should be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction.
897077_17_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The Company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominantly in European countries and Canada and, to a lesser extent, Australia and Brazil, as a result of the sale of its products in international markets.

897077_17_ITEM7A_P5_S2	On December 31, 2016 , the result of a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies in which the Company s sales are denominated would have been a decrease in gross profit of $ 5,755,000 .
897077_17_ITEM7A_P5_S3	Comparatively, on December 31, 2015 , the result of a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which the Company s sales are denominated would have been a decrease in gross profit of approximately $ 5,424,000 .
897077_17_ITEM7A_P6_S0	This calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar.
897077_17_ITEM7A_P6_S1	In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, which are a changed dollar value of the resulting sales, changes in exchange rates may also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive.
897077_17_ITEM7A_P6_S2	The Company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices.

897077_17_ITEM7A_P8_S1	Accordingly, the Company s net income is affected by changes in interest rates.
897077_17_ITEM7A_P8_S2	Assuming the average level of borrowings at variable rates and a two hundred basis point change in the 2016 average interest rate under these borrowings, the Company s 2016 interest expense would have changed by approximately $ 3,033,000 .
897077_17_ITEM7A_P9_S0	In the event of an adverse change in interest rates, management could take actions to mitigate its exposure.
897077_17_ITEM7A_P9_S1	Further, this analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment.
897077_17_ITEM7A_P9_S2	However, challenges affecting the banking industry and credit markets in general can potentially cause changes to credit availability and cost of borrowing, which creates a level of uncertainty.

897077_18_ITEM1_P82_S0	The Company s ability to provide innovative responses to customer needs, to develop and manufacture new products, and to enhance existing product lines is important to its success.
897077_18_ITEM1_P83_S0	The Company continually conducts research and development activities in an effort to improve existing products and develop new products.

897077_18_ITEM1_P84_S1	However, replacement parts are generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year, because a substantial number of the Company s products are used for maintenance activities such as vegetation maintenance, highway right-of-way maintenance, construction, and street and parking lot sweeping.

897077_18_ITEM1_P85_S0	The Company utilizes an annual twelve-month sales forecast provided by the Company s marketing departments which is updated quarterly in order to develop a production plan for its manufacturing facilities.
897077_18_ITEM1_P85_S1	In addition, many of the Company s marketing departments attempt to equalize demand for products throughout the calendar year by offering seasonal sales programs which may provide additional incentives, including discounts and extended payment terms.

897077_18_ITEM1_P86_S4	The Company believes that it is able to compete successfully in its markets by effectively managing its manufacturing costs, offering high quality products, developing and designing innovative products and, to some extent, avoiding direct competition with significantly larger potential competitors.
897077_18_ITEM1_P86_S5	There can be no assurance that the Company s competitors will not substantially increase the resources devoted to the development and marketing of products competitive with the Company s products or that new competitors with greater resources will not enter the Company s markets.

897077_18_ITEM1_P87_S2	The amount of unfilled orders at a particular time is affected by a number of factors, including manufacturing and shipping schedules which, in most instances, are dependent on the Company s seasonal sales programs and the requirements of its customers.

897077_18_ITEM1_P90_S0	While the Company manufactures many of the parts for its products, a significant percentage of parts, including most drivelines, gearboxes, industrial engines, and hydraulic components, are purchased from outside suppliers which manufacture to the Company s specifications.

897077_18_ITEM1_P93_S1	These laws and regulations are constantly changing, and it is impossible to predict with accuracy the effect that changes to such laws and regulations may have on the Company in the future.
897077_18_ITEM1_P94_S0	Like other industrial concerns, the Company s manufacturing operations entail the risk of noncompliance, and there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur material costs or other liabilities as a result thereof.
897077_18_ITEM1_P95_S0	The Company knows that its Indianola, Iowa property is contaminated with chromium which most likely resulted from chrome plating operations which were discontinued before the Company purchased the property.

897077_18_ITEM1_P95_S2	The Company voluntarily worked with an environmental consultant and the state of Iowa with respect to these issues and believes it completed its remediation program in June 2006.

897077_18_ITEM1_P96_S0	Certain assets of the Company contain asbestos that may have to be remediated over time.
897077_18_ITEM1_P96_S1	The Company believes that any subsequent change in the liability associated with the asbestos removal will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations.
897077_18_ITEM1_P97_S0	The Company is subject to various other federal, state, and local laws affecting its business, as well as a variety of regulations relating to such matters as working conditions, equal employment opportunities, and product safety.
897077_18_ITEM1_P97_S1	A variety of state laws regulate the Company s contractual relationships with its dealers, some of which impose restrictive standards on the relationship between the Company and its dealers, including events of default, grounds for termination, non-renewal of dealer contracts, and equipment repurchase requirements.
897077_18_ITEM1_P97_S2	The Company believes it is currently in material compliance with all such applicable laws and regulations.
897077_18_ITEM1_P98_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , the Company employed approximately 3,280 employees.

897077_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	You should carefully consider each of the risks described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision with respect to the Company s securities.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the following risks develop into actual events, the Company s business, financial condition or results from operations could be materially and adversely affected and you could lose all or part of your investment.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Deterioration of industry conditions could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our business depends to a large extent upon the prospects for the mowing, right-of-way maintenance and agricultural markets in general.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Future prospects of the industry depend largely on factors outside of our control.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Any of those factors could adversely impact demand for our products, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	increase in unfunded pension plan liability due to financial market deterioration.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In addition, our business is susceptible to a number of factors that specifically affect agricultural customer spending patterns, including the following:
897077_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	A downturn in general economic conditions and outlook in the United States and around the world could adversely affect our net sales and earnings.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The strength and profitability of our business depends on the overall demand for our products and upon economic conditions and outlook, including but not limited to economic growth rates; consumer spending levels; financing availability, pricing and terms for our dealers and end-users; employment rates; interest rates; inflation; consumer confidence and general economic and political conditions and expectations in the United States and the other economies in which we conduct business.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	and end-user customers, increased unemployment rates, and recessionary economic conditions and outlook could cause consumers to reduce spending, which may cause them to delay or forgo purchases of our products and could have an adverse effect on our net sales and earnings.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The pending exit by the U.K. from the European Union ( Brexit ) and the impact of the withdrawal may adversely affect business activity, political stability and economic conditions in the U.K., the European Union and elsewhere.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The economic conditions and outlook could be further adversely affected by the uncertainty concerning the timing and terms of the exit and new or modified trading arrangements between the U.K. and other countries.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Any of these developments, or the perception that any of these developments are likely to occur, could negatively affect economic growth or business activity in the U.K., the European Union and elsewhere, and could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Changes in U.S. tax legislation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("TCJA") that significantly reforms the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We are currently evaluating provisions of TCJA, which among other things, lowers the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, moves the country towards a territorial tax system with a one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings of foreign subsidiaries, imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation, creates taxes such as the base erosion anti-abuse tax ( BEAT ) and Global Intangible Low Taxed Income ( GILTI ) tax, and allows for the expensing of certain capital expenditures.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	As we do not have all the necessary information to analyze all income tax effects of TCJA, we have recorded a provisional amount which we believe represents a reasonable estimate of the accounting implications of TCJA.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We will continue to evaluate and adjust the provisional amounts as additional information is obtained.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We may not understand the full effect that this tax reform legislation will have on our business and it is possible that the impact of the legislation could adversely and materially impact our results of operations.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P11_S3	We expect to complete our detailed analysis no later than the fourth quarter of 2018.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P11_S4	For further information, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We depend on governmental sales and a decrease in such sales could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales to federal, state and local governmental entities and related contractors, both in the U.S. and in other countries in which we sell our products.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	These sales depend primarily on the levels of budgeted and appropriated expenditures for highway, airport, roadside and parks maintenance by various governmental entities and are affected by changes in local and national economic conditions.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our dependence on, and the price and availability of, raw materials as well as purchased components may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We are subject to fluctuations in market prices for raw materials such as steel and energy.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In addition, although most of the raw materials and purchased components we use are commercially available from a number of sources, we could experience disruptions in the availability of such materials.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P15_S2	If we are unable to purchase materials we require or are unable to pass on price increases to our customers or otherwise reduce our cost of goods sold, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P15_S3	In addition, higher energy costs could negatively affect spending by farmers, including their purchases of our products.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	This analysis requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P17_S2	The cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of time, which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to an even higher degree of uncertainty.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P17_S3	The Company also utilizes market valuation models and other financial ratios, which require the Company to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to its assets and businesses.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , goodwill was $ 84,761,000 , which represents 13% of total assets.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The Company recognized no goodwill impairment in 2017 , 2016 or 2015 .
897077_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	During the third quarter of 2015, the Company changed its annual goodwill and intangible assets impairment testing date from December 31 to October 1.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	During the 2017 impairment analysis review, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 15% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit as of October 1, 2017 would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any of the reporting units.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P19_S3	If we were to have a significant goodwill impairment caused by a greater than a 15% decline in fair value, it could impact our results of operations as well as our net worth.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We are significantly dependent on information technology.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic and financial information, to manage a variety of business processes and activities, and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations, personnel, customers, and suppliers.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	These information technology systems (some of which are provided and maintained by third parties) may be susceptible to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to hardware failures, computer viruses, hacker attacks, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophic events or other factors.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P21_S3	If our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown, and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience business disruptions, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of customers and sales, causing our product sales, financial condition, and operating results to be adversely affected and the reporting of our financial results to be delayed.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information or other sensitive information of our customers and employees.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Despite the information security measures we have taken, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory fines and penalties, disruption of our operations and the services we provide to customers, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Changes in the European regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection regulations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The EU has recently adopted a comprehensive overhaul of its data protection regime in the form of the General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ), which comes into effect in May of 2018.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	GDPR extends the scope of the existing EU data protection law to foreign companies processing personal data of EU residents.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	The regulation imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of 4% of worldwide turnover or 20 million, whichever is greater, and includes new rights such as the right of erasure of personal data.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Although the GDPR will apply across the EU, as has been the case under the current data protection regime, EU Member States have some national derogations and local data protection authorities ( DPAs ) will still have the ability to interpret the GDPR, which has the potential to create inconsistencies on a country-by-country basis.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Implementation of, and compliance with the GDPR could increase our cost of doing business and/or force us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	In addition, violations of the GDPR may result in significant fines, penalties and damage to our brand and business which could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business and reputation.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We operate in a highly competitive industry, and some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater resources than we do.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our products are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We compete with several large national and international companies that offer a broad range of equipment and replacement parts that compete with our products, as well as with numerous small, privately-held manufacturers and suppliers of a limited number of products mainly on a regional basis.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Some of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater financial and other resources at their disposal.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	There can be no assurance that our competitors will not substantially increase the resources devoted to the development and marketing of products competitive with our products or that new competitors with greater resources will not enter our markets.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Any failure to effectively compete could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Failure to develop new products or keep pace with technological developments may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations .
897077_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our industry is affected by future technological developments.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	The introduction of new products or processes with innovative technologies could render our existing products or processes obsolete or unmarketable.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Our success depends, to some extent, upon our ability to develop, market and sell cost-effective new products and applications that keep pace with technological developments in the markets we serve.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P30_S3	We may not be successful in identifying, developing and marketing new products and applications or we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of such new products and applications, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We operate and source internationally, which exposes us to the political, economic and other risks of doing business abroad.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We have operations in a number of countries outside of the United States and we source raw materials and components globally.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Our international operations are subject to the risks normally associated with conducting business in foreign countries, including but not limited to the following:
897077_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Operating in the international marketplace exposes us to a number of risks, including the need to comply with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our foreign operations, including anti-corruption laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, United States export control laws, and data privacy laws such as the recently enacted European GDPR.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P33_S1	The costs of compliance with these various laws, regulations and policies can be significant and penalties for noncompliance could significantly and adversely impact our business.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Our international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies affecting foreign trade, investment, taxation, and our ability to effectively source components and raw materials internationally.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P33_S3	For example, any significant changes in U.S. trade policy, including the introduction of any new or expanded tariffs, could increase the cost of critical materials and supplies that we source internationally or negatively impact international sales of our products, which would have an adverse effect on our net sales and earnings.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	In addition, political developments and governmental regulations and policies in the countries in which we operate directly affect the demand for our products.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	For example, decreases or delays in farm subsidies to our agricultural customers, or changes in environmental policies aimed at limiting mowing activities, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our acquisition strategy may not be successful, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We intend to grow internally and through the acquisition of businesses and assets that will complement our current businesses.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	To date, a material portion of our growth has come through acquisitions.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P36_S2	We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition targets, obtain financing for acquisitions on satisfactory terms or successfully acquire identified targets.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Competition for acquisition opportunities may also increase our costs of making acquisitions or prevent us from making certain acquisitions.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P36_S4	These and other acquisition-related factors may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We may be unable to complete or integrate existing or future acquisitions effectively, and businesses we have acquired, or may acquire in the future, may not perform as expected.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We may not be successful in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations and achieving projected synergies.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P38_S1	We could face many risks in integrating acquired businesses, including but not limited to the following:
897077_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	we may encounter unanticipated events, circumstances and legal risk and associated liabilities.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts from the management of each entity, including coordinating existing business plans and research and development efforts.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Integrating operations may distract management s attention from the day-to-day operation of the combined companies.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Ultimately, our attempts to integrate the operations, technology and personnel of acquired businesses may not be successful.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P40_S3	If we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses, our future results may be negatively impacted.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	In addition, we may be adversely affected if businesses that we have acquired, or that we acquire in the future, do not perform as expected.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P41_S1	An acquired business could perform below our expectations for a number of reasons, including legislative or regulatory changes that affect the areas in which the acquired business specializes, the loss of customers and dealers, general economic factors that directly affect the acquired business, and the cultural incompatibility of its management team.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Any or all of these reasons could adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The agricultural industry and the infrastructure maintenance industry are seasonal and are affected by the weather, and seasonal fluctuations may cause our results of operations and working capital to fluctuate from quarter to quarter.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	In general, agricultural and governmental end-users typically purchase new equipment during the first and second calendar quarters.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Other products such as street sweepers, excavators, snow removal equipment, front-end loaders and pothole patchers have different seasonal patterns, as do replacement parts in general.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P43_S2	In attempting to achieve efficient utilization of manpower and facilities throughout the year, we estimate seasonal demand months in advance and manufacturing capacity is scheduled in anticipation of such demand.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P43_S3	We utilize an annual plan with updated quarterly sales forecasts provided by our marketing divisions and order backlog in order to develop a production plan for our manufacturing facilities.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P43_S4	In addition, many of our marketing departments attempt to equalize demand for their products throughout the calendar year by offering seasonal sales programs which may provide additional incentives, including discounts and extended payment terms, on equipment that is ordered during off-season periods.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P43_S5	Because we spread our production and wholesale shipments throughout the year to take into account the factors described above, sales in any given period may not reflect the timing of dealer orders and retail demand.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Weather conditions and general economic conditions may affect the timing of purchases and actual industry conditions might differ from our forecasts.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Consequently, sudden or significant declines in industry demand could adversely affect our working capital or results of operations.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	If we do not retain key personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees, our business may suffer.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Our continued success will depend on, among other things, the efforts and skills of our executive officers, including our president and chief executive officer, and our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified managerial, technical, manufacturing, and sales and marketing personnel.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P46_S1	We do not maintain key man life insurance for any of our employees, and all of our senior management are employed at will.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P46_S2	We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and hire suitable replacements for any of our key employees.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P46_S3	We believe the loss of a key executive officer or other key employee could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We may not be able to realize the potential or strategic benefits of the acquisitions we complete, or we may not be able to successfully address problems encountered in connection with acquisitions.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Acquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P48_S1	We have completed a number of acquisitions over the past several years.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P48_S2	We expect to consider opportunities and make additional acquisitions in the future, but we may not find suitable acquisition targets or be able to consummate desired acquisitions due to among other things, unfavorable credit markets or other risks, which could harm our operating results.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P48_S3	Acquisitions can be difficult, time-consuming, and pose a number of risks, including:
897077_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	the assumption of liabilities that are unknown to us at the time of closing.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	If we do not manage these risks, the acquisitions that we complete may have an adverse effect on our business, our results of operations, or financial condition.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Increasingly stringent engine emission regulations could impact our ability to sell certain of our products into the market and appropriately price certain of our products, which could negatively affect our competitive position and financial results.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	The products we manufacture or sell, particularly engines, are subject to increasingly stringent environmental emissions regulations.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P52_S1	For instance, the EPA has adopted increasingly stringent engine emissions regulations, including Tier 4 emission requirements applicable to diesel engines in specified horsepower ranges that are used in some of our products.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P52_S2	As of January 1, 2012, such requirements expanded to additional horsepower categories and, accordingly, apply to more of the products we sell.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P52_S3	While we have developed and implemented plans to achieve full and timely compliance with these requirements, our ability to meet the Tier 4 requirements is subject to many variables, some of which are beyond our direct control.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P52_S4	If we fail to meet the Tier 4 requirements and any other EPA emission standards that are currently in place or that may be introduced in the future, our ability to sell our products into the market may be limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position and financial results.

897077_18_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all of the terms of our credit arrangements, especially the financial covenants.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Our ability to comply with such terms depends on the success of our business and our operating results.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Various risks, uncertainties, and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with the terms of our credit arrangements.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P61_S3	If we were out of compliance with any covenant required by our credit arrangements following any applicable cure periods, the banks could terminate their commitments unless we could negotiate a covenant waiver.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P61_S4	The banks could condition such waiver on amendments to the terms of our credit arrangements that may be unfavorable to us, including a potential increase to the interest rate we currently pay on outstanding debt under our credit arrangements could increase, which could adversely affect our operating results.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominantly in European countries, Canada and Australia, as a result of the sale of our products in international markets.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P63_S1	While we do enter into foreign exchange contracts to protect against such fluctuations to an extent (primarily in the U.K. market), we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively manage these risks.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, such as a devaluation of the Euro against the U.S. dollar, could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations or financial condition.

897077_18_ITEM1A_P66_S0	The stock price volatility and trading volume may make it difficult for you to resell your shares of our common stock when desired or at attractive prices.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P67_S0	You may experience dilution of your ownership interests due to the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P68_S0	We may issue shares of our previously authorized and unissued securities which will result in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P68_S1	We are currently authorized to issue 20,000,000 shares of common stock.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P68_S2	On December 31, 2017 , 11,640,100 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding, and there were outstanding options and restricted stock awards totaling an additional 302,927 shares of our common stock.

897077_18_ITEM1A_P68_S4	Additional stock option or other compensation plans or amendments to existing plans for employees and directors may be adopted.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P68_S5	Issuance of these shares of common stock may dilute the ownership interests of our then existing stockholders.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P68_S6	We may also issue additional shares of our common stock in connection with the hiring of personnel, future acquisitions, such as the 1,700,000 shares issued as consideration for the acquisition of Bush Hog in 2009, future private placements of our securities for capital raising purposes, or for other business purposes.

897077_18_ITEM1A_P69_S0	There is no assurance that we will continue declaring dividends or have the available cash to make dividend payments.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P70_S0	On January 2, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company increased its quarterly dividend from $.10 per share to $.11 per share.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P70_S1	Although we have paid a cash dividend in each quarter since becoming a public company in 1993, there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or that funds will continue to be available for this purpose in the future.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P70_S2	The declaration and payment of dividends are restricted by the terms of our amended and restated revolving credit agreement, are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, are not cumulative, and will depend upon our profitability, financial condition, capital needs, future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Provisions of our corporate documents may have anti-takeover effects that could prevent a change in control.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Provisions of our charter, bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P72_S1	These provisions include prohibiting stockholders from calling stockholder meetings and prohibiting shareholder actions by written consent.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P72_S2	Our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws state that any amendment to certain provisions, including those provisions regarding limitations on action by written consent discussed above, be approved by the holders of at least two-thirds of our common stock.

897077_18_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Future sales, or the possibility of future sales, of a substantial amount of our common stock may depress the price of the shares of our common stock.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Future sales, or the availability for sale in the public market, of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P74_S1	If we or our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or if there is a perception that these sales may occur, the market price of our common stock could decline.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Certain stockholders own a significant amount of our common stock, and their interests may conflict with those of our other stockholders.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P76_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , three investors - BlackRock, Inc., Henry Crown and Company, and Dimensional Fund Advisors LP - beneficially owned approximately 38% of our outstanding common stock.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P76_S1	As a result, the major stockholders combined could be able to significantly influence the direction of the Company, the election of our Board of Directors and the outcome of any other matter requiring stockholder approval, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and together with other beneficially owned investors, to prevent or cause a change in control of the Company.
897077_18_ITEM1A_P76_S2	Also, pursuant to contractual obligations, affiliates of Henry Crown and Company, were entitled to certain rights with respect to the registration of the common stock owned by them under the Securities Act.

897077_18_ITEM7_P0_S1	Actual results in future periods may differ materially from those expressed or implied because of a number of risks and uncertainties which are discussed below and in the Forward-Looking Information section beginning on page 11.
897077_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	In 2017 we experienced several market factors that helped drive positive results in our business including, among other things, strengthening agricultural markets, improving non-governmental sales and rentals of vacuum truck equipment, a strengthening European market and a softening U.S. dollar.
897077_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	While the Company believes that these market forces are showing some signs of stability for 2018, we remain cautious in terms of our outlook since market conditions can and do change regularly.
897077_18_ITEM7_P1_S2	As a result of overall improving market conditions our backlog substantially increased during the course of 2017 and, as of December 31, 2017, was in excess of $218 million.
897077_18_ITEM7_P1_S3	While this level of backlog is encouraging, the potential effect this level of demand will have on our production lead times has given us some cause for concern.
897077_18_ITEM7_P1_S4	As a response to this concern, in 2018 we are increasing our focus on ongoing operational improvement initiatives and will likely increase our capital expenditure levels above the average capital expenditure levels of the past several years.
897077_18_ITEM7_P1_S5	We also expect that inflation pressures may be more of a negative factor in 2018 as labor availability tightens and some commodity prices, such as the price of steel, increase.
897077_18_ITEM7_P1_S6	We may also be negatively affected by several other unanticipated factors such as a weakness in the overall economy; significant changes in currency exchange rates; changes in trade policy, increased levels of government regulations; weakness in the agricultural sector; acquisition integration issues; budget constraints or revenue shortfalls in governmental entities; and other risks and uncertainties as described in Risk Factors.
897077_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	-K. The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, certain financial data:

897077_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	The increase was mainly attributable to the increased demand for our products in all three of the Company's Divisions.
897077_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	Also contributing to the increase in sales were the acquisitions of Santa Izabel , ODB and RPM in the amount of $25,488,000.
897077_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	Net Industrial sales were $ 522,706,000 in 2017 compared to $ 484,088,000 in 2016 , an increase of $ 38,618,000 or 8.0% .
897077_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	The increase primarily came from higher sales of mowing equipment, sweepers, excavators and vacuum trucks.
897077_18_ITEM7_P5_S2	Also contributing to the increase were the acquisitions of ODB and RPM which together added $19,759,000.
897077_18_ITEM7_P5_S3	These increases were offset by lower sales of snow removal products due to mild weather conditions during the early part of 2017.
897077_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	Net Agricultural sales were $ 227,389,000 in 2017 compared to $ 205,834,000 in 2016 , representing an increase of $ 21,555,000 or 10.5% .
897077_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	The increase resulted from higher demand for our products despite some continued softness in the overall agricultural market.
897077_18_ITEM7_P6_S2	Also contributing to the increase was the acquisition of Santa Izabel in the amount of $5,729,000.
897077_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	Net European sales increased $ 7,459,000 or 4.8% to $ 162,285,000 in 2017 compared to $ 154,826,000 in 2016 .
897077_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	The increase was primarily due to improved sales in the U.K. and French agricultural markets as well as increased sales from Rivard vacuum trucks.
897077_18_ITEM7_P7_S2	Negatively affecting European sales in 2017 were currency translation rates.
897077_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	Gross profit for 2017 was $ 234,693,000 ( 25.7% of net sales) compared to $ 205,099,000 ( 24.3% of net sales) in 2016 , an increase of $ 29,594,000 .
897077_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	The increase in gross profit for 2017 came from higher equipment and part sales in all three of the Company's divisions and, to a lesser extent, the acquisitions of Santa Izabel , ODB and RPM .
897077_18_ITEM7_P8_S2	The increased higher margin percentage for 2017 came from productivity improvements, pricing actions, and purchasing initiatives.
897077_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG A ) were $145,955,000 ( 16.0% of net sales) in 2017 compared to $137,479,000 ( 16.3% of net sales) in 2016 , an increase of $8,476,000.
897077_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	The increase in SG A was primarily the result of the acquisitions of Santa Izabel , ODB and RPM in the amount of $4,491,000 and to a lesser extent higher commissions and other selling expenses due to increased sales as well as transactional costs relating to the acquisitions.
897077_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	Interest expense for 2017 was $ 4,839,000 compared to $ 5,914,000 in 2016 , a decrease of $ 1,075,000 or 18.2% .The decrease in expense in 2017 came from lower debt levels despite a marginal increase in interest rates during 2017.
897077_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	Other income (expense), net was expense of $ 1,868,000 during 2017 compared to income of $ 269,000 in 2016 .
897077_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	The expense in 2017 and the income in 2016 were primarily the result of changes in exchange rates.
897077_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	Provision for income taxes was $ 38,052,000 ( 46.2% of income before income taxes) for 2017 compared to $ 22,144,000 ( 35.6% of income before income taxes) in 2016 .
897077_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	The increases in both income taxes and the effective tax rate were primarily due to a $10,236,000 tax expense in 2017 resulting from the implementation of the provisions under the TCJA signed into law on December 22, 2017.
897077_18_ITEM7_P12_S2	The effective rate for 2017, excluding the impact of the $10,236,000 expense related to TCJA, was 33.8%.
897077_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	See Note12 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the TCJA and $10,236,000 expense recorded by the Company.
897077_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	Net income for 2017 was $ 44,315,000 compared to $ 40,045,000 in 2016 , due to the factors described above.

897077_18_ITEM7_P15_S2	Sales of excavators, sweepers, mowing equipment and to a lesser extent, snow removal products were up in 2016 compared to 2015.
897077_18_ITEM7_P15_S3	Agricultural Division sales were down 1.2% for 2016 due to a continued weak agricultural market compared to the same period in 2015.
897077_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	market conditions and currency translation rates which the Company believed was due, in part, to the uncertainty created by the recent Brexit vote in the U.K.
897077_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	Net Industrial sales were $484,088,000 in 2016 compared to $498,761,000 in 2015, a decrease of $14,673,000 or 2.9%.
897077_18_ITEM7_P17_S1	The decrease came from lower vacuum trucks sales to non-governmental end users.
897077_18_ITEM7_P17_S2	Increased sales from sweeper, excavator, mowing equipment and snow removal equipment product lines were not enough to offset the decline in sales of vacuum truck products.
897077_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	Net Agricultural sales were $205,834,000 in 2016 compared to $208,257,000 in 2015, representing a decrease of $2,423,000 or 1.2%.
897077_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	The decrease in sales for 2016 compared to 2015 was from the continued softness in the overall agricultural market.
897077_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	Net European sales decreased $17,733,000 or 10.3% to $154,826,000 in 2016 compared to $172,559,000 in 2015.
897077_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	The decrease in 2016 was primarily due to the negative effect on sales from changes in currency translation rates.
897077_18_ITEM7_P19_S2	The European Division continued to be faced with challenging market conditions in the U.K. Rivard vacuum equipment and the French agricultural products had increased sales in 2016 compared to 2015 from improvements in operational execution.
897077_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	Gross margins for 2016 were $205,099,000 (24.3% of net sales) compared to $202,448,000 (23.0% of net sales) in 2015, an increase of $2,651,000.
897077_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	Despite lower sales volume, the gross profit increase was due to continuous improvement in production efficiencies as well as lower material costs.
897077_18_ITEM7_P20_S2	Negatively affecting both the gross profit and margin percent during 2015 was $2,740,000 in higher cost of goods sold related to the initial step-up in fair value of inventory in the Specialized business divisions acquired in 2014.
897077_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG A ) were $137,479,000 (16.3% of net sales) in 2016 compared to $135,920,000 (15.5% of net sales) in 2015.
897077_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	The increase in SG A was primarily the result of a $2,889,000 in pension expense related to cumulative actuarial losses related to the closure of the Gradall Hourly Employees' Savings and Investment Plan that had been previously deferred in Other comprehensive income and Deferred taxes.
897077_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	Interest expense for 2016 was $5,914,000 compared to $6,724,000 in 2015, a decrease of $810,000 or 12.0%.The decrease in 2016 came from the Company's reduction in borrowings which resulted in lower interest costs.
897077_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	Other income (expense), net was income of $269,000 during 2016 compared to income of $6,874,000 in 2015.
897077_18_ITEM7_P23_S1	The income in 2016 was primarily the result of changes in exchange rates.
897077_18_ITEM7_P23_S2	The income in 2015 was primarily from the gain on the sale of excess land in the U.K. in the amount of $3,796,000 and changes in exchange rates.
897077_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	Provision for income taxes was $22,144,000 (35.6% of income before income taxes) for 2016 compared to $23,658,000 (35.4% of income before income taxes) in 2015.
897077_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	Net income for 2016 was $40,045,000 compared to $43,209,000 in 2015 due to the factors described above.
897077_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	In addition to normal operating expenses, the Company has ongoing cash requirements which are necessary to conduct the Company s business, including inventory purchases and capital expenditures.
897077_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	The Company s inventory and accounts payable levels, particularly in its Agricultural Division, build in the first quarter and early spring and, to a lesser extent, in the fourth quarter in anticipation of the spring and fall selling seasons.
897077_18_ITEM7_P26_S2	Accounts receivable historically build in the first and fourth quarters of each year as a result of pre-season sales and year round sales programs.
897077_18_ITEM7_P26_S3	These sales, primarily in the Agricultural Division, help balance the Company s production during the first and fourth quarters.
897077_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , the Company had working capital of $ 291,164,000 , which represents an increase of $ 42,246,000 from working capital of $ 248,918,000 as of December 31, 2016 .
897077_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	The increase in working capital was primarily due to sales growth and to a lesser extent the acquisitions of Santa Izabel , ODB and RPM .
897077_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	Capital expenditures were $ 13,490,000 for 2017 , compared to $ 9,711,000 for 2016 which included the purchase of the land and buildings at the Company's Wausau facility in the amount of $4,745,000.
897077_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	The Company expects to fund capital expenditures from operating cash flows or through its revolving credit facility, described below.
897077_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	In conjunction with our implementation of the provisions of TCJA, and as more fully described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, we recorded a liability in 2017 for the estimated U.S. federal tax due on the deemed repatriation of the accumulated earnings and profits of our international subsidiaries not previously distributed.
897077_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	We will pay this liability over the eight-year period permitted by the TCJA provisions.
897077_18_ITEM7_P29_S2	The deemed repatriation of these accumulated earnings and profits are no longer subject to any U.S. federal income tax consequences associated with the repatriation of the Company's $23,019,000 in cash and cash equivalents held by its foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 .
897077_18_ITEM7_P29_S3	The majority of these funds are at our French and Canadian facilities.
897077_18_ITEM7_P29_S4	As a result of the fundamental changes to the taxation of multinational corporations created by TCJA, we no longer intend to permanently reinvest all of the historical undistributed earnings of our foreign affiliates.
897077_18_ITEM7_P29_S5	While the Company intends to use some of these funds for working capital and capital expenditures outside the U.S., recent changes in the U.S. tax laws have substantially mitigated the cost of repatriation.
897077_18_ITEM7_P29_S6	Consequently, the Company now intends to repatriate foreign cash and cash equivalents in excess of amounts needed to fund foreign operating and investing activities.
897077_18_ITEM7_P29_S7	Repatriated funds will initially be used to reduce funded debt levels under the Company's current credit facility and subsequently used to fund working capital, capital investments and acquisitions company-wide.
897077_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	Net cash provided by operating activities was $ 70,804,000 for 2017 , compared to $ 75,784,000 for 2016 .
897077_18_ITEM7_P30_S1	The decrease of cash from operating activities came primarily from changes in working capital due to sales growth in all three Divisions .
897077_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	Net cash used in investing activities was $51,276,000 for 2017 , compared to $8,656,000 for 2016 .
897077_18_ITEM7_P31_S1	The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the acquisitions of Santa Izabel , ODB and RPM .
897077_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	Net cash used by financing activities was $ 12,400,000 for 2017 , compared to net cash used of $ 77,347,000 for 2016 .
897077_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	The decrease in cash used in financing activities was due to significant reductions of outstanding indebtedness under the Company's revolving credit facility during 2016.
897077_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	The Company maintains an unsecured revolving credit facility with certain lenders under its Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement ("Agreement").
897077_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	The aggregate commitments from lenders under this Agreement are $250,000,000 and, subject to certain conditions, the Company has the option to request an increase in aggregate commitments of up to an additional $50,000,000 .
897077_18_ITEM7_P33_S2	The Agreement requires us to maintain various financial covenants including a minimum earnings before interest and tax to interest expense ratio, a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum asset coverage ratio.
897077_18_ITEM7_P33_S3	The Agreement also contains various covenants relating to limitations on indebtedness, limitations on investments and acquisitions, limitations on sale of properties, and limitations on liens and capital expenditures.
897077_18_ITEM7_P33_S4	The Agreement also contains other customary covenants, representations and events of defaults.
897077_18_ITEM7_P33_S5	Effective December 20, 2016, the Company amended its revolving credit facility to extend the termination date, reduce LIBOR interest margin and to modify certain financial and other covenants in order to meet the ongoing needs of the Company's business and to allow for greater flexibility in relation to future acquisitions.
897077_18_ITEM7_P33_S6	The expiration date of the revolving credit facility is December 20, 2021 .
897077_18_ITEM7_P33_S7	As of December 31, 2017 , $60,000,000 was outstanding under the Agreement.
897077_18_ITEM7_P33_S8	On December 31, 2017 , $1,655,000 of the revolver capacity was committed to irrevocable standby letters of credit issued in the ordinary course of business as required by vendors' contracts resulting in $188,345,000 in available borrowings.
897077_18_ITEM7_P33_S9	As of December 31, 2017 , the Company was in compliance with the terms and conditions of the Agreement.
897077_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	Management believes the revolving credit facility and the Company s ability to internally generate funds from operations should be sufficient to meet the Company s cash requirements for the foreseeable future.
897077_18_ITEM7_P34_S1	However, challenges affecting the banking industry and credit markets in general can potentially cause changes to credit availability, which creates a level of uncertainty.
897077_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	The Company believes that inflation generally has not had a material impact on its operations or liquidity.
897077_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	the Company may not be able to increase the price of its products correspondingly.
897077_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	If this occurs, the Company s results of operations would be adversely impacted.
897077_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance and clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue.
897077_18_ITEM7_P37_S1	This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
897077_18_ITEM7_P37_S2	The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract.
897077_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	This new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those annual periods.
897077_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	We have completed our evaluation of the provisions of this standard and concluded that our adoption will not change the amount or timing of revenue recognized by us, nor will it affect our financial position.
897077_18_ITEM7_P38_S2	Revenue from contracts with customers are recognized at the point we satisfy our performance obligation.
897077_18_ITEM7_P38_S3	Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for providing the service.
897077_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	We will adopt this new standard effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method of adoption as permitted by the standard.
897077_18_ITEM7_P39_S1	Under this method, the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard is recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of stockholders equity, and revenues reported in the periods prior to the date of adoption are not changed.
897077_18_ITEM7_P39_S2	We will not, however, make such an adjustment to stockholder s equity as result of our evaluation.
897077_18_ITEM7_P39_S3	The adoption of Topic 606 will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, stockholders equity or cash flows.
897077_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases.
897077_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	This update requires that a lessee recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.
897077_18_ITEM7_P40_S2	For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities.
897077_18_ITEM7_P40_S3	Similar to current guidance, the update continues to differentiate between finance leases and operating leases, however this distinction now primarily relates to differences in the manner of expense recognition over time and in the classification of lease payments in the statement of cash flows.
897077_18_ITEM7_P40_S4	The updated guidance leaves the accounting for leases by lessors largely unchanged from existing GAAP.
897077_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	Entities are required to use a modified retrospective adoption, with certain relief provisions, for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements when adopted.
897077_18_ITEM7_P41_S1	The guidance will become effective for us on January 1, 2019.
897077_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	The impacts that adoption of the ASU is expected to have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures are being evaluated.
897077_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	Additionally, we have not yet determined the effect of the ASU on our internal control over financial reporting or other changes in business practices and processes.
897077_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, to improve information on credit losses for financial instruments.
897077_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	The ASU replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses.
897077_18_ITEM7_P43_S2	The ASU is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
897077_18_ITEM7_P43_S3	Early adoption is permitted beginning in fiscal years beginning after December 18, 2018.
897077_18_ITEM7_P43_S4	The Company has not yet evaluated the effect the adoption of this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.
897077_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07 Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Post-retirement Benefit Cost to provide income statement classification guidance for components of the net benefit cost.
897077_18_ITEM7_P44_S1	The ASU requires entities to disaggregate the current-service-cost component from the other components of net benefit cost (the other components ) and present it with other current compensation costs for related employees in the income statement.
897077_18_ITEM7_P44_S2	Furthermore, entities should present the other components elsewhere in the income statement and outside of income from operations if such a subtotal is presented.
897077_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	The ASU is to be adopted retrospectively and is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years and may be early adopted.
897077_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses to other income (loss) on the consolidated statements of income.
897077_18_ITEM7_P46_S1	The Company s pensions, including net periodic cost, is disclosed in Note 15 .
897077_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, to allow reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
897077_18_ITEM7_P47_S1	Upon adoption of the ASU, entities will be required to disclose a description of the accounting policy for releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income.
897077_18_ITEM7_P47_S2	The standard is required to be adopted for periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption available for any set of financial statements that have yet to be issued or made available for issuance including retrospectively for any period in which the effect of the change is the U.S. corporate income tax rate in the TCJA is recognized.
897077_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	There are currently no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are currently likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition.
897077_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	The following table shows the Company s approximate obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 :
897077_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	Definitions: (A) Long-term debt obligation means a principal payment obligation under long-term borrowings.
897077_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	(B) Interest obligation represents interest due on long-term debt and capital lease obligations.
897077_18_ITEM7_P50_S2	Interest on long-term debt assumes all floating rates of interest remain the same as those in effect at December 31, 2017 .
897077_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	(C) Operating lease obligation means a payment obligation under a lease classified as an operating lease.
897077_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	(D) Purchase obligation means an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the registrant that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions.
897077_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ).
897077_18_ITEM7_P52_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
897077_18_ITEM7_P52_S2	Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
897077_18_ITEM7_P52_S3	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
897077_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the financial statements.
897077_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	For further information on the critical accounting policies, see Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
897077_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	Business acquisitions are accounted for by the acquisition method of accounting.
897077_18_ITEM7_P55_S1	Under this method, the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on the fair value at the time of the acquisition.
897077_18_ITEM7_P55_S2	Any excess purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill.
897077_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	We believe the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions; however, these assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur.
897077_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	Tangible assets are typically valued using a replacement or reproduction cost approach, considering factors such as current prices of the same or similar equipment, the age of the equipment, and economic obsolescence.
897077_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	In making other assumptions on valuation and useful lives, we considered the unique nature of the acquisition and we utilized a third-party valuation firm to assist us in the valuation of the acquired intangibles and the resulting allocation of purchase price for the acquisition.
897077_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	On December 31, 2017 , the Company had $ 15,652,000 in reserves for sales discounts compared to $ 13,488,000 on December 31, 2016 on product shipped to our customers under various promotional programs.
897077_18_ITEM7_P59_S1	The Company reviews the reserve quarterly based on analysis made on each program outstanding at the time.
897077_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	The Company bases its reserves on historical data relating to discounts taken by the customer under each program.
897077_18_ITEM7_P60_S1	Historically, between 85% and 95% of the Company s customers who qualify for each program actually take the discount that is available.
897077_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	The Company had a reserve of $ 6,932,000 on December 31, 2017 and $ 7,262,000 on December 31, 2016 to cover obsolete and slow moving inventory.
897077_18_ITEM7_P61_S1	The decrease in the reserve was primarily attributable to reductions of obsolete inventory in the Company's Industrial Division.
897077_18_ITEM7_P61_S2	The obsolete and slow moving inventory policy states that the reserve is to be calculated as follows: 1) no inventory usage over a three-year period is deemed obsolete and reserved at 100 percent; and 2) slow moving inventory with little usage requires a 100 percent reserve on items that have a quantity greater than a three-year supply.
897077_18_ITEM7_P61_S3	There are exceptions to the obsolete and slow moving classifications if approved by an officer of the Company, based on specific identification of an item or items that are deemed to be either included or excluded from this classification.
897077_18_ITEM7_P61_S4	In cases where there is no historical data, management makes a judgment based on a specific review of the inventory in question to determine what reserves, if any, are appropriate.
897077_18_ITEM7_P61_S5	New products or parts are generally excluded from the reserve policy until a three-year history has been established.
897077_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	The reserve is reviewed and, if necessary, adjustments are made on a quarterly basis.
897077_18_ITEM7_P62_S1	The Company relies on historical information when available to support its reserve.
897077_18_ITEM7_P62_S2	The Company does not adjust the reserve balance until the inventory is liquidated.
897077_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	The Company s warranty policy is generally to provide its customers warranty for up to one year on all wholegood divisions and 90 days on parts, though some components can have warranty for longer terms.
897077_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	Warranty reserve, as a percentage of sales, is generally calculated by looking at the current twelve months expenses and prorating that amount based on twelve months sales with a ninety-day to six-month lag period.
897077_18_ITEM7_P64_S1	The Company s historical experience is that an end-user takes approximately 90 days to six months from the receipt of the division to file a warranty claim.
897077_18_ITEM7_P64_S2	A warranty reserve is established for each different marketing group.
897077_18_ITEM7_P64_S3	Reserve balances are evaluated on a quarterly basis and adjustments made when required.
897077_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	The current liability warranty reserve balance was $ 5,335,000 on December 31, 2017 and $ 5,262,000 on December 31, 2016 .
897077_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
897077_18_ITEM7_P66_S1	Goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level.
897077_18_ITEM7_P66_S2	Definite-lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment at the reporting unit level whenever events or circumstances make it likely that an impairment may have occurred.
897077_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	Reporting units are operating segments or components of operating segments for which discrete financial information is available.
897077_18_ITEM7_P67_S1	To evaluate goodwill, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value.
897077_18_ITEM7_P67_S2	Where the carrying value is greater than the fair value, the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit with any remainder being allocated to goodwill.
897077_18_ITEM7_P67_S3	The implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared to the carrying value of that goodwill to determine whether an impairment loss exists.
897077_18_ITEM7_P67_S4	Any impairment loss is recognized in earnings.
897077_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	We typically measure the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis (income approach) based on assumptions that market participants would apply.
897077_18_ITEM7_P68_S1	Because the business is assumed to continue in perpetuity, the discounted cash flows include a terminal value.
897077_18_ITEM7_P68_S2	Cash flows to perpetuity are forecast based on projected revenue growth and our planned business strategies in future periods.
897077_18_ITEM7_P68_S3	Examples of planned strategies would include a plant or line expansion at an existing facility; a reduction of working capital at a specific location; and price increases or cost reductions within a reporting unit.
897077_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	The discount rate is based on a reporting unit s targeted weighted-average cost of capital, which is not necessarily the same as our weighted-average cost of capital.
897077_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	We perform our annual test for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.
897077_18_ITEM7_P70_S1	In 2017 a qualitative testing was performed and the Company determined there was no goodwill impairment related to our reporting units.
897077_18_ITEM7_P70_S2	During 2016 and 2015 , we determined that none of the goodwill associated with our reporting units were impaired in any of those years which was based on the quantitative testing.
897077_18_ITEM7_P70_S3	These reporting units would be most likely affected by changes in the Company s assumptions and estimates.
897077_18_ITEM7_P70_S4	The calculation of fair value could increase or decrease depending on changes in the inputs and assumptions used, such as changes in the reporting unit s future growth rates, discount rates, etc.
897077_18_ITEM7_P70_S5	These assumptions and projections underlying the fair value estimates are subject to change and are impacted by our ability to achieve our forecasts and by economic conditions that may impact future results and result in projections not being attained.
897077_18_ITEM7_P70_S6	A change in any of these estimates and assumptions could produce a different fair value, which could have a material impact on our results of operations.
897077_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	Each year we re-evaluate the assumptions used to reflect changes in the business environment.
897077_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, issued by the SEC.
897077_18_ITEM7_P72_S1	As a result, we will record the effect in 2018 for items where we were unable to make a reasonable estimate in 2017, and we may revise estimates that we recorded in 2017.
897077_18_ITEM7_P72_S2	See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our tax liabilities and the impact from Tax Reform on those liabilities.
897077_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The Company is exposed to various financial market risks.
897077_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates.
897077_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The Company does not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
897077_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	A portion of the Company s operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities in international jurisdictions.
897077_18_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The Company manufactures its products primarily in the United States, the U.K., France, Canada, Brazil and Australia.
897077_18_ITEM7A_P2_S2	The Company sells its products primarily within the markets where the products are produced, but certain of the Company s sales from its U.K. and Canadian operations are denominated in other currencies.
897077_18_ITEM7A_P2_S3	As a result, the Company s financials, specifically the value of its foreign assets, could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the U.K. and Canada or weak economic conditions in the other markets in which the subsidiaries of the Company distribute their products.
897077_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	To mitigate the short-term effect of changes in currency exchange rates on the Company s functional currency-based sales, the Company s U.K. and Canadian subsidiaries regularly enter into foreign exchange contracts for over 90% of their future net foreign currency cash receipts over a period of six months.
897077_18_ITEM7A_P3_S1	As of December 31, 2017 , the Company had a notional amount of $ 1,142,000 in outstanding forward exchange contracts related to accounts receivable.
897077_18_ITEM7A_P3_S2	A 15% fluctuation in exchange rates for these currencies would change the fair value by approximately $ 171,000 .
897077_18_ITEM7A_P3_S3	However, since these contracts offset foreign currency denominated transactions, any change in the fair value of the contracts should be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction.
897077_18_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The Company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominantly in European countries and Canada and, to a lesser extent, Australia and Brazil, as a result of the sale of its products in international markets.
897077_18_ITEM7A_P4_S1	Foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the U.K. are used to offset the earnings effects of such fluctuations.
897077_18_ITEM7A_P4_S2	On December 31, 2017 , the result of a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies in which the Company s sales are denominated would have been a decrease in gross profit of $ 6,564,000 .
897077_18_ITEM7A_P4_S3	Comparatively, on December 31, 2016 , the result of a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which the Company s sales are denominated would have been a decrease in gross profit of approximately $ 5,755,000 .
897077_18_ITEM7A_P5_S0	This calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar.
897077_18_ITEM7A_P5_S1	In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, which are a changed dollar value of the resulting sales, changes in exchange rates may also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive.
897077_18_ITEM7A_P5_S2	The Company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices.
897077_18_ITEM7A_P5_S3	The translation adjustment during 2017 was a gain of $16,966,000 .
897077_18_ITEM7A_P5_S4	On December 31, 2017 , the British pound closed at 0.7400 relative to the U.S. dollar, and the Euro closed at 0.8331 relative to the U.S. dollar.
897077_18_ITEM7A_P5_S5	By comparison, on December 31, 2016 , the British pound closed at 0.8100 relative to the U.S. dollar, and the Euro closed at 0.9506 relative to the U.S. dollar.
897077_18_ITEM7A_P5_S6	No assurance can be given as to future valuation of the British pound or Euro or how further movements in those or other currencies could affect future earnings or the financial position of the Company.
897077_18_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Interest Rate Risk The majority of the Company s long-term debt bears interest at variable rates.
897077_18_ITEM7A_P6_S1	Accordingly, the Company s net income is affected by changes in interest rates.
897077_18_ITEM7A_P6_S2	Assuming the average level of borrowings at variable rates and a two hundred basis point change in the 2017 average interest rate under these borrowings, the Company s 2017 interest expense would have changed by approximately $ 2,535,000 .
897077_18_ITEM7A_P7_S0	In the event of an adverse change in interest rates, management could take actions to mitigate its exposure.
897077_18_ITEM7A_P7_S1	Further, this analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment.
897077_18_ITEM7A_P7_S2	However, challenges affecting the banking industry and credit markets in general can potentially cause changes to credit availability and cost of borrowing, which creates a level of uncertainty.

897077_18_ITEM9B_P0_S0	The Amended and Restated Alamo Group Inc.
897077_18_ITEM9B_P0_S1	Executive Incentive Plan (the Plan ) under which executive officers and other employees will be eligible to receive annual cash incentive awards based on the achievement of objective and subjective performance goals for performance periods commencing on or after January 1, 2018 was approved by the Board of Directors on March 1, 2018.
897077_18_ITEM9B_P0_S2	The Plan is similar to the Executive Incentive Plan approved by the Board of Directors on March 7, 2013 and approved by the stockholders of the Company at the Company s 2013 annual meeting of shareholders, but it has been modified as a result of recent changes in U.S. federal tax law.
