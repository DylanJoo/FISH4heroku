1054721_11_ITEM1_P0_S0	The remaining information required by this Item is included in our definitive proxy statement for our 2011 annual meeting of shareholders to be filed with the SEC under the caption Corporate Governance and is incorporated herein by this reference.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P1_S1	If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and the trading price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	that a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of Microsoft General Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, Microsoft has a significant direct and indirect influence on our business.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The following represent several Microsoft-related risk factors which may negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P2_S2	If we do not maintain our OEM and Windows Mobile Distribution Agreements with Microsoft or if Microsoft de-emphasizes or divests itself from these areas of its business, our revenue would decrease and our business would be adversely affected.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P2_S3	We have an OEM Distribution Agreement for Software Products for Embedded Systems ( ODA ) with Microsoft, which enables us to sell Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems to our customers in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean (excluding Cuba) and Mexico.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Software sales under this agreement constitute a significant portion of our revenue.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Our existing ODA was effective as of July 1, 2010 and expires on June 30, 2011.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P2_S6	We also entered into another distribution agreement (the Winmo ODA ) with Microsoft in November 2009 under which we are now licensed to sell Microsoft Windows Mobile operating systems to customers on a worldwide basis.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P2_S7	The Winmo ODA is effective through October 31, 2011.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P2_S8	We generated $10.2 million of revenue in 2010 through the Winmo ODA, and expect this revenue stream to continue in 2011.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P2_S9	If either or both of these agreements are terminated by Microsoft (which Microsoft can do unilaterally), or not renewed, or if Microsoft decides to no longer invest in or to divest itself from these areas of its business, our software revenue and resulting gross profit would decrease significantly and our operating results would be negatively impacted.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P2_S10	Future renewals, if any, could be on less favorable terms, which could also negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Effective September 1, 2008, Microsoft changed its pricing structure under the ODA, which it can do at any time, whereby Microsoft generally increased the price of software licenses we pay to Microsoft.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Microsoft could change its pricing structure again and, unless we are able to either pass through price increases to our customers, or sign our customers to 12-month purchasing commitments, which lowers the price we pay to Microsoft, our revenue, gross profit and operating results would be negatively impacted.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Further, Microsoft currently offers a rebate program in conjunction with our ODA activities in which we earn money for achieving certain predefined objectives.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P3_S3	If Microsoft were to eliminate or negatively modify the rebate program, our gross profit and operating results would be negatively impacted.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Microsoft has audited our records under the ODA in the past and will likely audit our records again in the future for both the ODA and the Winmo ODA, and any negative audit results could result in additional charges and/or the termination of the ODA and the Winmo ODA.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P3_S5	There are provisions in the ODA and Winmo ODA that require us to maintain certain internal records and processes for royalty auditing and other reasons.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P3_S6	Non-compliance with these and other requirements could result in the termination of the ODA and Winmo ODA.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	On January 22, 2010, Microsoft concluded an audit of our records pertaining to the ODA, which covered the period from October 2006 to September 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	A similar audit conducted in 2007 similarly produced no material findings; however, an audit in 2003 and 2004, covering a period of five years, resulted in a payment to Microsoft of $310,000.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	It is possible that future audits could result in additional charges.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P4_S3	If we do not maintain our favorable relationship with Microsoft, we will have difficulty marketing and selling our software and services and may not receive developer releases of Windows Embedded operating systems and Windows Mobile targeted platforms.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P4_S4	As a result, our revenue and operating results could suffer.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P4_S5	We maintain a strategic marketing relationship with Microsoft.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P4_S6	If our relationship with Microsoft deteriorates for any reason, including an increased focus by us on customers building devices utilizing non-Microsoft Embedded operating systems, our efforts to market and sell our software and services to OEMs and others could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	systems and Windows Mobile targeted platforms for smart devices and these targeted platforms are a significant focus for us.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Microsoft provides customer referrals to us.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Moreover, Microsoft controls the marketing campaigns related to its operating systems.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Microsoft s marketing activities, including trade shows, direct mail campaigns and print advertising, are important to the continued promotion and market acceptance of Windows Embedded operating systems and Windows Mobile targeted platforms and, consequently, to our sale of Windows-based software and services.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P5_S4	We must maintain a favorable relationship with Microsoft to continue to participate in joint marketing activities with them, which includes participating in partner pavilions at trade shows, listing our services on Microsoft s website, and receiving customer referrals.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P5_S5	In the event that we are unable to continue our joint marketing efforts with Microsoft, or fail to receive referrals from them, we would be required to devote significant additional resources and incur additional expenses to market our software products and services directly to potential customers.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P5_S6	In addition, we depend on Microsoft for developer releases of new versions of, and upgrades to, Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile software in order to facilitate timely development and delivery of our own software and services.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P5_S7	If we are unable to maintain our favorable relationship with Microsoft, our revenue could decline significantly, and/or our costs could increase significantly, thereby negatively impacting our operating results.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P5_S8	Unexpected delays or announcement of delays by Microsoft of Windows Embedded operating systems and Windows Mobile targeted platforms product releases could adversely affect our revenue and operating results.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P5_S9	Unexpected delays or announcement of delays in Microsoft s delivery schedule for new versions of its Windows Embedded operating systems and Windows Mobile targeted platforms could cause us to delay our product introductions or impede our ability to sell our products and services and/or to complete customer projects on a timely basis.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P5_S10	Such delays, or announcements of delays by Microsoft, could also cause our customers to delay or cancel their project development activities or product introductions, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P5_S11	If Microsoft adds features to its Windows operating system or develops products that directly compete with products and services we provide, our revenue and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P5_S12	As the developer of Windows, Windows XP Embedded, Windows CE and Windows Mobile, Microsoft could add features to its operating systems which eliminate or reduce our customers need for our software and services, or Microsoft could develop standalone products and services that compete with the products and services we provide to our customers.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P5_S13	The ability of our customers, or potential customers, to obtain products and services directly from Microsoft that compete with our products and services could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P5_S14	Even if the standard features of future Microsoft operating system software were more limited than our offerings, a significant number of our customers, and potential customers, might elect to accept more limited functionality in lieu of purchasing additional software from us or delay the purchase of our products and services while they perform a comparison of Microsoft s competing offerings.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P5_S15	Moreover, the resulting competitive pressures could lead to price reductions for our offerings and reduce our revenue and gross profit accordingly and our operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P5_S16	If the markets for Windows Embedded operating systems and Windows Mobile targeted platforms fail to develop further, develop more slowly than expected, or decline, our business and operating results may be materially harmed.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P5_S17	Because a significant portion of our revenue to date has been generated by software and services targeted at customers and devices utilizing the Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, if the markets for these systems or platforms fail to develop further, or develop more slowly than expected, or decline, our business and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P5_S18	Market acceptance of Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile will depend on many factors, including:
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Microsoft s development and support of the Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile markets.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The ability of the Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems and Windows Mobile software to compete against existing and emerging operating systems for the smart device market, including: OSx from Apple, Inc., VxWorks and Linux from WindRiver Systems Inc.; Symbian; JavaOS from Sun Microsystems, Inc.; Android from Google Inc.; Blackberry from RIM; and other proprietary operating systems.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	In particular, in the market for handheld devices, Windows Mobile faces intense competition from the Symbian, RIM, Android and Apple operating systems.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In the market for converged devices, Windows Embedded faces intense competition from the Linux operating system and more recently from Android.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The willingness of software developers to continue to develop and expand the applications that run on Windows Embedded operating systems and Windows Mobile targeted platforms.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	To the extent that software developers write applications for competing operating systems that are more attractive to smart device users than those available on Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, potential customers could select competing operating systems over Windows Embedded operating systems and Windows Mobile targeted platforms.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Ford-Related Risk Factors If we do not obtain additional work from Ford in 2011, or increase our work for new or existing customers, our future revenue and gross profit would decrease and our operating results would be adversely affected.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Revenue from Ford comprised $12.9 million, or 13%, of our total revenue in 2010.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P9_S2	We expect this project work to continue in 2011 under the Ford Telematics Competency Center ( FCC ) but expect revenue from Ford to be lower in 2011 than in 2010 due to the lower level of personnel resources utilized in the FCC than were utilized in the original project.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P9_S3	While we do currently expect to be actively involved in future projects with Ford in 2011 and beyond, if our role in fulfilling Ford s plans is scaled back or eliminated beyond 2011, or if we are unable to increase our work for new or existing customers to compensate for a decrease in Ford-related revenue, our revenue and resulting gross profit would suffer and negatively impact our operating results.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P9_S4	If we breach our Agreement with Ford, fail to comply with the requirements of the Agreement, or are required to perform warranty repairs on any of the Ford vehicles into which our work is incorporated, or if any of those vehicles are recalled due to defects in our work, our revenue, operating results and overall business could be negatively impacted.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P9_S5	Our Agreement with Ford provides customary representations and warranties to Ford and we accept liability for certain damages that are incurred by Ford as a result of our breach or failure to comply with the requirements of the Agreement.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P9_S6	These damages may include consequential damages.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P9_S7	The agreement also provides that we will indemnify Ford against certain third party claims.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P9_S8	In addition, warranty repairs on our work for Ford could require us to devote additional hours that would not be billable.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P9_S9	A significant warranty claim could require immediate remediation and consume a large amount of our billable resources until it is fixed, which could negatively impact our revenue, operating results and our business.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P9_S10	In addition, if a defect were significant enough to require a vehicle recall, the costs of such a recall could be significant.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We have increased our overall insurance amounts, but many claims, including, but not limited to, warranty and recall related issues, may not be covered by insurance.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	General Business-Related Risk Factors Our marketplace is extremely competitive, which may result in price reductions, lower gross profit margins and loss of market share.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The market for our software and services is extremely competitive.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Increased competition may result in lower revenue, price reductions, lower gross profit and margin and loss of customers and market share, which could negatively impact our operating results.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Companies and products that compete with us in mobile and embedded test automation, including DeviceAnywhere, Perfecto Mobile, mVerify, JAMO Solutions, SmartBear Software (AutomatedQA), TestPlant (eggPlant), and Keynote.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	In this market we also compete against potential customers internally created tools and against manual testing.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Some of our competitors focus on only one aspect of our business or offer complementary products which can be integrated with our products.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P12_S3	As we develop and bring to market new product and service offerings, particularly offerings focused on specific industries and/or focused on devices utilizing non-Windows Embedded operating systems, we may begin competing with companies with which we have not previously competed.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P12_S4	It is also possible that new competitors will enter the market or that our competitors will form alliances, including alliances with Microsoft, that may enable them to rapidly increase their market share.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Microsoft has not agreed to any exclusive arrangement with us, nor has it agreed not to compete with us.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Microsoft may decide to bring more of the core embedded development services and expertise that we provide in-house, possibly resulting in reduced software and service revenue opportunities for us.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P12_S7	In addition, Microsoft has created marketing programs to encourage systems integrators to work on Windows Embedded operating system software and services.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P12_S8	These systems integrators are given substantially the same access by Microsoft to the Windows technology as we are.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P12_S9	New competitors may have lower overhead than we do and may be able to undercut our pricing.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P12_S10	We expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter the Windows-based smart device market, and as new products and technologies are introduced.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P12_S11	Our ability to maintain or grow our proprietary software revenue is contingent on our ability to bring to market competitive, unique offerings that keep pace with technological changes and needs.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P12_S12	If we are not successful in doing so, our business would be negatively impacted.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Proprietary software product sales provide us with much higher gross profit margins than we typically receive from third-party software products and our engineering service offerings and provide other advantages as well.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Increasing the number and amount of proprietary products we sell is an important part of our growth strategy.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Our ability to maintain and increase the revenue contribution from proprietary software products is contingent on our ability to enhance the features and functionality of our current proprietary products as well as to devise, develop and introduce new products.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P13_S3	There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or expand the number of proprietary products that we sell, and our failure to do so could negatively impact revenue and our operating results.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We may experience delays in our efforts to develop new products and services, and these delays could cause us to miss market opportunities which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The market for our software and services evolves rapidly.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P15_S1	As a result, the life cycles of our products and services are difficult to estimate.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P15_S2	To be successful, we believe we must continue to enhance our current offerings and provide new software and service offerings with attractive features, prices and terms that appeal to our customers.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P15_S3	We have experienced delays in new software and service offering introductions in the past and may do so again in the future.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Our revenue and operating results may be negatively impacted if we delay releases of new products, product enhancements and/or new services offerings, or if we fail to accurately anticipate our customers needs or technical trends and are unable to introduce new products and service offerings into the market successfully.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P15_S5	In addition, our customers may defer or forego purchases of our products and/or services if we, Microsoft, our competitors or major hardware, systems or software vendors introduce or announce new products.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Our future success depends upon our customers ability to successfully sell their products incorporating our technology, and to continue buying our services.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P15_S7	Even if a customer selects us to provide software and services, the customer may not ultimately market and sell its product successfully.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P15_S8	A cancellation or change in plans by a customer, whether from lack of market acceptance of its products or otherwise, could cause us to lose revenue that we had anticipated and our revenue and operating results would suffer.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P15_S9	Also, our revenue and operating results could suffer if a significant customer reduces or delays orders during our sales cycle or chooses not to release products that contain our technology.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P15_S10	If the market for smart devices grows more slowly than we expect, or declines, our revenue may not grow as anticipated, if at all, and our business would be harmed.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P15_S11	The market for smart devices is still in fluctuation and the potential size of this market and the timing of its development are not known.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P15_S12	As a result, our profit potential is uncertain and our revenue may not develop as anticipated.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P15_S13	We are dependent upon the broad acceptance and adoption by businesses and consumers of a wide variety of smart devices, which will depend on many factors, including:
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The amount of discretionary funds companies and individuals have to spend for this kind of technology.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The success and profitability of our service offerings are contingent on our ability to differentiate these offerings adequately in the marketplace, which is, in turn, contingent on our ability to retain our engineering personnel and defend our billing rate structure against those of our competitors, including those using lower-cost offshore resources.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P16_S2	If we are unable to do so successfully, our business could be harmed.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P16_S3	We are a leader in providing engineering services to smart device customers.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Our market differentiation is created through several factors, including our experience with a variety of smart device platforms and applications.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	expertise, a significant portion of which are currently based in the United States.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P17_S1	To the extent we are unable to retain critical engineering services talent and/or our competition is able to deliver the same services by using lower-cost offshore resources, our service revenue and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P17_S2	The success and profitability of our service engagements are contingent upon our ability to scope and bid engagements and deliver our services profitably.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P17_S3	If we are unable to do so, our service revenue service gross profit margin and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Various factors may cause the total cost of service projects to exceed the original estimate provided to the customer or the contractual maximum in the case of fixed price contracts, including specification changes, customer deliverable delays, inadequate scoping and inefficient service delivery.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P18_S1	If we are unable to adequately scope, bid and deliver on service engagements successfully, our service revenue, service gross margin and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P18_S2	In addition, depending on the cause of an overrun for a given customer and project, we may also decide to provide pricing concessions to that customer which could negatively impact our service revenue, service gross profit and operating results.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We periodically enter into engineering service agreements in which we have agreed to perform our engineering service work for lower up-front fees, or for no fees, in exchange for future royalties or per unit fees.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	There is no guarantee that these arrangements will produce the strategic or economic returns as anticipated.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We have entered into contracts that involve reducing or eliminating up-front engineering service fees in return for a per-device/chip royalty or fee that is earned as our customers ship their devices or chips, and we may enter into more such agreements in the future.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Because we are delaying revenue past the point where our services are performed, there is a risk that our customers may cancel their projects or that their devices or chips may not be successful in the market, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Cooperation and support from silicon vendors is critical for the success of our products and related services that are developed for their particular silicon architecture.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P19_S5	We have developed, and continue to develop software and service offerings based on certain silicon architectures (e.g. the TI OMAP architecture).
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Due to the nature of the industry we serve and the products we develop, it is necessary for us to make certain assumptions regarding which silicon vendors will be successful in the various markets we serve and upon which we are making investments.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P20_S1	It is therefore important that there is ongoing support from the SVs in the marketplace for these silicon architectures.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P20_S2	For example, during the development of a reference design board, Intel made a strategic decision to sell its PXA Xscale division to Marvell which negatively impacted the sale of our Xscale-based reference designs.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P20_S3	There can be no assurance that Marvell, TI, or any of the other SVs will continue to pursue and support the markets that we have been targeting.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P20_S4	If the SVs do not support our efforts going forward, our revenue and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P20_S5	The long sales cycle of our products and services makes our revenue susceptible to fluctuations.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Our sales cycle is typically three to nine months because the expense and complexity of the software and service offerings we sell generally require a lengthy customer approval process and may be subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control, including:
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The timing of customers competitive evaluation processes.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	In addition, to successfully sell our software and engineering service offerings, we must frequently educate our potential customers about the full benefits of our software and services, which can require significant time.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P22_S1	If our sales cycle further lengthens unexpectedly, it could adversely affect the timing of our revenue, which could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Erosion of the financial condition of our customers could adversely affect our business.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Our business could be adversely affected if the financial condition of our customers erodes because such erosion could reduce demand from those customers for our software and engineering services.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P22_S4	This could also cause them to terminate their relationships with us, and/or could increase the risk that such customers default on their payment obligations to us.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Additionally, while we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate, current economic trends may cause more companies to default or cease operations, in which case our allowances may not cover actual losses, which could adversely affect our operating results.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P22_S6	We may be subject to product liability claims that could result in significant costs.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P22_S7	Our software license and service agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims with the notable exception of our project with Ford.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P22_S8	It is possible, however, that these provisions may be ineffective under the laws of certain jurisdictions or that our customers may not agree to these limitations.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P22_S9	Although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date, the sale and support of our products and services may be subject to such claims in the future.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P22_S10	There is a risk that any such claims or liabilities may exceed, or fall outside, the scope of our insurance coverage, and we may be unable to retain adequate liability insurance in the future.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P22_S11	A product liability claim brought against us, whether successful or not, could negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P22_S12	Continued negative cash flows from our TestQuest products may negatively affect the carrying value of the intangible assets we acquired from TestQuest.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P22_S13	In the fourth quarter of 2008, we purchased certain assets of TestQuest including acquired technology and other intangible assets with a total gross carrying value of $1.9 million.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P22_S14	As of December 31, 2010, these assets had a net carrying value of $1.0 million, net of accumulated amortization.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P22_S15	Although we generated approximately $582,000 of cash from these assets during the fourth quarter of 2010, and we expect to continue to generate cash from these assets in the future, it is possible that we may be required to reassess the carrying value of these assets in the future, which may lead to a determination that these assets are not recoverable through future cash flows, which may result in an impairment charge that would negatively impact our operating results.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P22_S16	Past acquisitions have proven difficult to integrate, and recent or future acquisitions, if any, could disrupt our business, dilute shareholder value and negatively affect our operating results.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We have acquired the technologies, assets and/or operations of other companies in the past and may acquire or make investments in companies, products, services and technologies in the future as part of our growth strategy.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	If we fail to properly evaluate, integrate and execute on our acquisitions and investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P23_S2	To successfully complete an acquisition, we must properly evaluate the technology, market and management team, accurately forecast the financial impact of the transaction, including accounting charges and transaction expenses, integrate and retain personnel, combine potentially different corporate cultures and effectively integrate products and research and development, sales, marketing and support operations.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P23_S3	If we fail to do any of these, we may suffer losses and impair relationships with our employees, customers and strategic partners.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Additionally, management may be distracted from day-to-day operations.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P23_S5	We also may be unable to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, which are especially critical in light of Sarbanes-Oxley and other corporate governance requirements, and significant demands may be placed on our management and our operations, information services and financial, legal and marketing resources.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P23_S6	Finally, acquired businesses sometimes result in unexpected liabilities and contingencies, which may involve compliance with foreign laws, payment of taxes, labor negotiations or other unknown costs and expenses, which could be significant.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We may not be able to raise additional capital if required to support our business.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P24_S1	If we need to raise additional operating capital, we may find that our access to equity and debt capital markets is limited or blocked entirely.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Until recently, our stock has historically traded at low volumes and overall investor confidence in the stock market could falter.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P24_S3	This could make it difficult or impossible to sell additional shares on the public markets.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P24_S4	In addition, it may be difficult and costly to obtain debt financing and we may be unable to borrow additional funds at acceptable cost, or at all, should the need arise.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P24_S5	If we are unable to raise capital as necessary, it may adversely affect our ability to invest in products or fund operations, which would materially harm our business and negatively affect operating results.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P24_S6	We are dependent on our insurance carriers to cover certain risks and a failure of one or more of our carriers, or a tightening of the market that increases our costs or decreases our ability to obtain necessary coverage, could negatively impact our business.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P24_S7	We have added significant additional insurance to cover the additional exposure presented by our work for Ford and other customers.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	As with the overall financial market, the insurance market is currently volatile.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P25_S1	While all of our insurance carriers appeared to be viable as of the date of this Report, if this changes, we are unable to maintain current coverage through viable insurance carriers at reasonable rates, or we are unable to obtain additional coverage that we deem necessary for our business, we may be unable to meet our financial obligations if claims that would otherwise have been covered by this insurance are made which could negatively impact our financial condition and operating results.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Taxing jurisdictions in the United States are becoming more aggressive with tax legislation and tax collection, particularly states facing significant budget deficits, which could expose us to additional tax liability that we have not been subject to in the past.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We make sales in many jurisdictions across the United States, most of which we do not have nexus in and, therefore, are not subject to sales, franchise, income and other state and local taxes.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Particularly in light of state revenue deficits, taxing jurisdiction have become more aggressive in defining nexus, among other things, which could result in us achieving nexus, or potentially achieving nexus in significantly more tax jurisdictions.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P26_S3	If this occurs and unless we are able to pass through this cost to our customers, our tax expense will increase which will negatively affect our results of operations.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Further, because state and local tax laws are becoming increasingly complex, our cost to monitor our state and local tax compliance will increase which will negatively affect our results of operations.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P26_S5	Additionally, there can be no assurance that we do not currently have unknown tax exposure in a state or local tax jurisdiction because of recent tax law changes which we are unaware of and the resulting liability could be significant and would negatively affect our results of operations.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	There may be restrictions on the use of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards due to a tax law ownership change .
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code restricts the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	At December 31, 2010, we had $59.2 million in net operating loss carryforwards and $2.4 million of tax credit carryforwards.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Under the applicable tax rules, an ownership change occurs if greater than five percent shareholders of an issuer s outstanding common stock collectively increase their ownership percentage by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We have performed analyses of possible ownership changes which included consideration of a third-party study, and do not believe that an ownership change (as defined by this Section) has occurred.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P29_S2	However, if a tax law ownership change has occurred of which we are not aware, or if a tax law ownership change occurs in the future, we may have to adjust the valuation of our deferred tax assets, and could be at risk of having to pay income taxes notwithstanding the existence of our sizable carryforwards.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Further, to the extent that we have utilized our carryforwards from prior years, the existence of a previous tax law ownership change that we did not account for could result in liability for back taxes, interest, and penalties.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our services work provides a disproportionate amount of our gross profit in relation to our overall revenue and a loss of any significant services customer or revenue could disproportionately impact our profitability.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Certain customers who purchase custom engineering services may contribute significantly to our gross profit, while not rising to the level of a significant or material customer based on overall revenue.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P30_S2	If the amount of work for these customers decreases or we cease to do work for these customers and we are not able to replace these customers or revenue with similarly profitable engagements, our gross profit and overall results from operations may be negatively impacted.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Intellectual Property-Related Risk Factors Our software and service offerings could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which could expose us to additional costs and litigation and could adversely affect our ability to sell our products and services or cause shipment delays or stoppages.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P31_S1	It is difficult to determine whether our software and engineering services infringe third-party intellectual property rights, particularly in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which technologies often overlap and where there may be numerous patent applications pending, many of which are confidential when filed.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P31_S2	If we were to discover that one of our software or service offerings, or a product based on one of our reference designs, violated a third-party s proprietary rights, we may not be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, to continue offering that product or service.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Similarly, third parties may claim that our current or future software products and services infringe their proprietary rights, regardless of whether such claims have merit.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Any such claims could increase our costs and negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	In certain cases, we have been unable to obtain indemnification against claims that third-party technology incorporated into our software products and services infringe the proprietary rights of others.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P32_S1	However, any indemnification we do obtain may be limited in scope or amount.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Even if we receive broad third-party indemnification, these entities may not have the financial capability to indemnify us in the event of infringement.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P32_S3	In addition, in some circumstances we are required to indemnify our customers for claims made against them that are based on our software products or services.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P32_S4	There can be no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims related to the software products and services we provide, or arising from the incorporation by us of third-party technology, and claims for indemnification from our customers resulting from such claims, will not be asserted or prosecuted against us.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P32_S5	Some of our competitors have, or are affiliated, with companies with substantially greater resources than we have, and these competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than we could.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P32_S6	In addition, we expect that software developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the software industry grows, and as the functionality of products in different industry segments increasingly overlap.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P32_S7	Such claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources in addition to potential product redevelopment costs and delays.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P32_S8	Furthermore, if we were unsuccessful in resolving a patent or other intellectual property infringement action claim against us, we may be prohibited from developing or commercializing certain of our technologies and products, or delivering services based on the infringing technology, unless we obtain a license from the holder of the patent or other intellectual property rights.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P32_S9	There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain any such license on commercially favorable terms, or at all.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P32_S10	If such license is not obtained, we would be required to cease these related business operations, which could negatively impact our business, revenue and operating results.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P32_S11	If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may be able to use our technology or trademarks, which could weaken our competitive position, reduce our revenue and increase our costs.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P32_S12	If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, our competitive position could be weakened and our revenue and operating results adversely affected.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	These laws and procedures provide only limited protection.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P33_S1	It is possible that another party could obtain patents that block our use of some, or all, of our software and services.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P33_S2	If that occurred, we would need to obtain a license from the patent holder or design around those patents.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P33_S3	The patent holder may or may not choose to make a license available to us at all, or on acceptable terms.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Similarly, it may not be possible to design around a blocking patent.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P33_S5	In general, there can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws will be effective to prevent misappropriation of our technology, or to prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to or competitive with those developed by us.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We frequently license the source code of our software products and the source code results of our services to customers.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P34_S1	There can be no assurance that customers with access to our source code will comply with the license terms or that we will discover any violations of the license terms or, in the event of discovery of violations, that we will be able to successfully enforce the license terms and/or recover the economic value lost from such violations.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	To license some of our software products, we rely in part on shrinkwrap and clickwrap licenses that are not signed by the end user and, therefore, may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P35_S1	As with other software, our software products are susceptible to unauthorized copying and uses that may go undetected, and policing such unauthorized use is difficult.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	A significant portion of our marks include the word BSQUARE or the preface b.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Other companies use forms of BSQUARE or the preface b in their marks alone, or in combination with other words, and we cannot prevent all such third-party uses.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We license certain trademark rights to third parties.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Such licensees may not abide by our compliance and quality control guidelines with respect to such trademark rights.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Any of these outcomes could negatively impact our brand, dilute its recognition in the marketplace, or confuse potential customers, all of which could harm our business.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The computer software market is characterized by frequent and substantial intellectual property litigation, which is often complex and expensive, and involves a significant diversion of resources and uncertainty of outcome.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property or to defend against a claim of infringement or invalidity.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Litigation could result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources and could negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Our software or hardware products or the third-party hardware or software integrated with our products or delivered as part of our service offerings may suffer from defects or errors that could impair our ability to sell our products and services.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Software and hardware components as complex as those needed for smart devices frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P38_S5	We have had to delay commercial release of certain versions of our products until problems were corrected and, in some cases, have provided product enhancements to correct errors in released products.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P38_S6	Some of our contracts require us to repair or replace products that fail to work.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P38_S7	To the extent that we repair or replace products our expenses may increase.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P38_S8	In addition, it is possible that by the time defects are fixed, the market opportunity may decline which may result in lost revenue.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P38_S9	Moreover, to the extent that we provide increasingly comprehensive products and services, particularly those focused on hardware, and rely on third-party manufacturers and suppliers to manufacture these products, we will be dependent on the ability of third-party manufacturers to correct, identify and prevent manufacturing errors.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P38_S10	Errors that are discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance, diversion of development resources, damage to our reputation and increased service and warranty costs, all of which could negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P38_S11	If we are unable to license key software from third parties, our business could be harmed.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P38_S12	We sometimes integrate third-party software with our proprietary software and engineering service offerings or sell such third-party software offerings on a standalone basis (e.g. Embedded operating systems under our ODA with Microsoft).
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P38_S13	If our relationships with these third-party software vendors were to deteriorate, or be eliminated in their entirety, we might be unable to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	technology internally, assuming it was economically or technically feasible, or seek similar software offerings from other third parties assuming there were competing offerings in the marketplace, which could delay or limit our ability to introduce enhancements or new products, or to continue to sell existing products and engineering services, thereby negatively impacting our revenue and operating results.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Governance and Contract-Related Risk Factors It might be difficult for a third-party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation, bylaws and Washington law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in the control of us or a change in our management, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Our Board of Directors has the authority under our amended and restated articles of incorporation to issue preferred stock with rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P39_S4	As a result, preferred stock could be issued quickly and easily with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make removal of our management more difficult.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P39_S5	In addition, our Board of Directors is divided into three classes.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P39_S6	The directors in each class serve for three-year terms, one class being elected each year by our shareholders.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P39_S7	This system of electing and removing directors may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company because it generally makes it more difficult for shareholders to replace a majority of our directors.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P39_S8	In addition, Chapter 19 of the Washington Business Corporation Act generally prohibits a target corporation from engaging in certain significant business transactions with a defined acquiring person for a period of five years after the acquisition, unless the transaction or acquisition of shares is approved by a majority of the members of the target corporation s Board of Directors prior to the time of acquisition.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P39_S9	This provision may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of our company.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P39_S10	The existence of these anti-takeover provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P39_S11	Non-compliance with our lease agreement could have a material adverse impact on our financial position.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P39_S12	Under the terms of our corporate headquarters lease signed in February 2004, if we default under the lease, the landlord has the ability to demand cash payments forgiven in 2004.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P39_S13	The amount of the forgiven payments for which the landlord has the ability to demand repayment was $900,000 at December 31, 2010, and decreases on a straight-line basis over the length of our ten-year headquarters lease.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P39_S14	Any breach of or non-compliance with this lease agreement could negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	International Operations-Related Risk Factors Our international operations, particularly our planned international expansion, expose us to greater intellectual property, management, collections, regulatory and other risks.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Customers outside of North America generated 16% of our total revenue in 2010 and 5% in 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P40_S2	We currently have operations outside of North America in Taiwan and also have a limited sales and/or support presence in China, India, Japan, South Korea and the United Kingdom; however, we are in the process of expanding our operations in these countries while also expanding in additional geographies.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Our international activities and operations, and our current expansion plans expose us to a number of risks, including the following:
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Complex and/or adverse tax laws and/or changes thereto.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The inherent risks of working in a certain highly regulated and/or controlled economies where relationships between company management and government officials is critical to timely processing of approvals required to conduct business.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P42_S1	These risks could have a material adverse effect on the financial and managerial resources required to operate our foreign offices, as well as on our future international revenue, which could negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P42_S2	As we increase the amount of software development conducted in non-U.S. locations, potential delays and quality issues may impact our ability to timely deliver our software and services, potentially impacting our revenue and profitability.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P42_S3	We conduct development activities in non-U.S. locations, primarily India (through a partnership with a local company) and Taiwan, to take advantage of the high-quality, low-cost software development resources found in those countries.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Additionally, we have plans to significantly increase development activity in our Taiwan operation and to initiate software development in a major software development center in China.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P42_S5	To date, we have limited experience in managing large scale software development outside the United States.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P42_S6	Expanding our international software development inherently increases the complexity of managing these programs and may result in delays in introducing new products to market, or delays in completing service projects for our customers, which in turn may adversely impact the revenue we recognize from related software products and services and could also adversely impact the profitability of service engagements employing offshore resources, thereby negatively affecting our operating results.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P42_S7	As our customers seek more cost-effective locations to develop and manufacture their smart devices, particularly overseas locations, our ability to continue to sell these customers our software products and services could be limited, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P42_S8	Due to competitive and other pressures, some of our customers have and others may seek to move the development and manufacturing of their smart devices to overseas locations, which may limit our ability to sell these customers our software and services.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P42_S9	As an example, under our ODA with Microsoft, we are currently only able to sell Microsoft Embedded operating systems primarily in North America.
1054721_11_ITEM1A_P42_S10	If our customers, or potential customers, move their manufacturing overseas we may be restricted from reselling these customers Microsoft Embedded operating systems, or our other products and services, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	In North America, we also lease office space in San Diego, California; Longmont, Colorado; Boston, Massachusetts; Chanhassen, Minnesota; Akron, Ohio; Dallas, and Texas.
1054721_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	We lease office space overseas in Beijing, China, Seoul, Korea, Tokyo, Japan, and Taipei, Taiwan.
1054721_11_ITEM2_P0_S2	Our facilities have sufficient capacity to support our current operational needs as well as short-term growth plans.
1054721_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	In Summer and early Fall 2001, four shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against us, certain of our current and former officers and directors (the Individual Defendants ), and the underwriters of our initial public offering (the Underwriter Defendants ).
1054721_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	The complaints were consolidated into a single action and a Consolidated Amended Complaint, which was filed on April 19, 2002.
1054721_11_ITEM3_P1_S0	The operative complaint alleged violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
1054721_11_ITEM3_P1_S1	The suit purported to be a class action filed on behalf of purchasers of our common stock during the period from October 19, 1999 to December 6, 2000.
1054721_11_ITEM3_P1_S2	The plaintiffs alleged that the Underwriter Defendants agreed to allocate stock in our initial public offering to certain investors in exchange for excessive and undisclosed commissions and agreements by those investors to make additional purchases of stock in the aftermarket at pre-determined prices.
1054721_11_ITEM3_P1_S3	The plaintiffs alleged that the prospectus for our initial public offering was false and misleading in violation of the securities laws because we did not disclose these arrangements.
1054721_11_ITEM3_P1_S4	The action sought damages in an unspecified amount.
1054721_11_ITEM3_P2_S0	On December 5, 2006, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals vacated a decision by the district court granting class certification in six of the coordinated cases, which are intended to serve as test, or focus cases.
1054721_11_ITEM3_P2_S1	The plaintiffs selected these six cases, which do not include us.
1054721_11_ITEM3_P2_S2	On April 6, 2007, the Second Circuit denied a petition for rehearing filed by the plaintiffs, but noted that the plaintiffs could ask the district court to certify more narrow classes than those that were rejected.
1054721_11_ITEM3_P3_S0	The parties in the approximately 300 coordinated cases, including the parties in our case, reached a settlement in early 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM3_P3_S1	As part of the settlement, the insurers for the issuer defendants will make the entire settlement payment on behalf of the issuers, including us.
1054721_11_ITEM3_P3_S2	On October 5, 2009, the district court granted final approval of the settlement.
1054721_11_ITEM3_P4_S0	Three objectors filed a petition to the Second Circuit seeking permission to appeal the district court s final approval order on the basis that the settlement class is broader than the class previously rejected by the Second Circuit in its December 5, 2006 order vacating the district court s order certifying classes in the focus cases.
1054721_11_ITEM3_P4_S1	Objectors to the settlement are proceeding with two appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
1054721_11_ITEM3_P4_S2	Plaintiffs have moved to dismiss both appeals.
1054721_11_ITEM3_P4_S3	Following the district court s final approval of the settlement, we determined that it is unlikely that we will be liable for any damages that will not be paid for by our insurance carriers, even if any appeals are successful.
1054721_11_ITEM3_P4_S4	As a result, it was determined that an accrued legal fees liability of $534,000 was no longer probable.
1054721_11_ITEM3_P4_S5	Consequently, this liability was reversed, which resulted in a reduction of selling, general and administrative expense during 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM3_P4_S6	However, due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, subsequent events could affect the assessment of this liability and this disclosure.
1054721_11_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol BSQR.
1054721_11_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table sets forth the high and low closing prices for our common stock for the periods indicated, as reported by the NASDAQ Global Market.
1054721_11_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of February 28, 2011, there were 144 holders of record of our common stock.
1054721_11_ITEM5_P1_S1	Because many shares of our common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of shareholders, we are unable to determine the total number of shareholders represented by these holders of record.
1054721_11_ITEM5_P1_S2	Dividends We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock.
1054721_11_ITEM5_P1_S3	We currently intend to retain any future earnings to fund future development and growth and, therefore, do not anticipate paying any consistent cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1054721_11_ITEM5_P1_S4	Our Board of Directors has, however, periodically considered implementing a share repurchase program and/or a special one-time cash dividend.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P0_S1	Some statements and information contained in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are not historical facts but are forward-looking statements.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P0_S2	For a discussion of these forward-looking statements, and of important factors that could cause results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this report, see Item 1 of Part I, Business Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A of Part I, Risk Factors.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	We provide software solutions to companies that develop smart, connected devices and to companies that assist others in developing smart, connected devices.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	A smart, connected device is a dedicated purpose computing device that typically has a display, runs an operating system (e.g., Microsoft Windows CE) and may be connected to a network via a wired or wireless connection.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P2_S1	Examples of smart devices include set-top boxes, home gateways, point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, voting machines, gaming platforms, tablets, handheld data collection devices, personal media players, smart phones and devices targeted at automotive applications.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P2_S2	We primarily focus on smart devices that utilize embedded versions of the Microsoft Windows family of operating systems, specifically Windows CE, Windows XP Embedded and Windows Mobile .
1054721_11_ITEM7_P2_S3	However, as a result of several acquisitions, coupled with our strategic intent to broaden our market focus, we also provide software solutions to customers developing devices utilizing other operating systems such as Android and Linux.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	We have been providing software solutions to the smart device marketplace since our inception.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	Our customers include world class OEMs, ODMs, and enterprises, as well as SVs and peripheral vendors which purchase our software solutions for purposes of facilitating processor and peripheral sales to the aforementioned customer categories.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P3_S2	In the case of enterprises, our customers include those which develop, market and distribute smart devices on their own behalf as well as those that purchase devices from OEMs or ODMs and require additional device software or testing.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P3_S3	The software solutions we provide are utilized and deployed throughout various phases of our customers device life cycle, including design, development, customization, quality assurance and deployment.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P4_S2	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts, percentage of completion on fixed price service contracts, fair values of financial instruments, deferred tax asset reserve, intangible assets, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, fair values of stock-based awards, and income taxes, among others.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P4_S3	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P4_S4	We recognize revenue from software and engineering service sales when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the selling price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P4_S5	Contracts and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P4_S6	Shipping documents and time records are generally used to verify delivery.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	determinable based on the contract and/or customer purchase order and payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	We assess collectability based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer s payment history.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	Periodically, we will begin work on engineering service engagements prior to having a signed contract and, in some cases, the contract is signed in a quarter after which service delivery costs are incurred.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P6_S2	We do not defer costs associated with these uncontracted engagements.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P6_S3	We recognize software revenue upon shipment provided that no significant obligations remain on our part, substantive acceptance conditions, if any, have been met and the other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	Service revenue from time and materials contracts, and training service agreements, is recognized as services are performed.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	Certain fixed-price service agreements, and time and materials service agreements with capped fee structures, are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P7_S2	We use the percentage-of-completion method of accounting because it is the most accurate method to recognize revenue based on the nature and scope of our fixed-price professional engineering service contracts; it is a better measure of periodic income results than other methods and it better matches revenue recognized with the costs incurred.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P7_S3	Percentage of completion is measured based primarily on input measures such as hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P7_S4	The estimation of total hours and progress to completion on these arrangements determines the amount of revenue we recognize as well as whether a loss is recognized if one is expected to be incurred for the remainder of the project.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P7_S5	Revisions to hour and cost estimates are incorporated in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	We also enter into arrangements in which a customer purchases a combination of software licenses, engineering services and post-contract customer support and/or maintenance ( PCS ).
1054721_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	As a result, contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting, including how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements if there are multiple elements.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	PCS may include rights to upgrades, when and if available, telephone support, updates, and enhancements.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	When vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) of fair value exists for all elements in a multiple element arrangement, revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each of the elements.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	VSOE of fair value is established by the price charged when the same element is sold separately.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P10_S2	Accordingly, the judgments involved in assessing the fair values of various elements of an agreement can impact the recognition of revenue in each period.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P10_S3	Changes in the allocation of the sales price between deliverables might impact the timing of revenue recognition, but would not change the total revenue recognized on the contract.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	When elements such as software and engineering services are contained in a single arrangement, or in related arrangements with the same customer, we allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value, provided that such element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	In the absence of fair value for a delivered element, revenue is first allocated to the fair value of the undelivered elements and then allocated to the residual delivered elements.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P11_S2	In the absence of fair value for an undelivered element, the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting, resulting in a delay of revenue recognition for the delivered elements until the undelivered elements are fulfilled.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P11_S3	As a result, contract interpretations and assessments of fair value are sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	When engineering services and royalties are contained in a single arrangement, we recognize revenue from engineering services as earned in accordance with the criteria above even though the effective rate per hour may be lower than typical because the customer is contractually obligated to pay royalties on their device shipments.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P12_S1	We recognize royalty revenue, classified as software revenue, when the royalty report from the customer is received or when such royalties are contractually guaranteed and the revenue recognition criteria are met, particularly that collectability is reasonably assured.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P12_S2	There are two items involving revenue recognition that require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments: the determination of VSOE of fair value in multiple element arrangements and the estimation of percentage of completion on fixed-price service contracts.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	multiple-element arrangements other than those involving the sale of PCS related to the sale of our TestQuest automated testing tools.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	Total TestQuest PCS revenue, generally deferred at sale and recognized over the life of the PCS agreement, was $1.0 million in 2010 and $472,000 in 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	We establish VSOE of fair value for TestQuest PCS using the bell-curve approach, based on the price when PCS is sold separately.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	VSOE of TestQuest PCS has been well established in the past as these products have been sold on a stand-alone basis for a number of years even prior to our acquisition of TestQuest assets in November 2008.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	If VSOE has not been established for a product, and there is no third-party evidence of selling price, we estimate the proportion of the selling price attributed to each delivered element.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P15_S2	Accordingly, the judgments involved in assessing the fair values of various elements of an agreement can impact the recognition of revenue in each period.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P15_S3	Changes in the allocation of the sales price between deliverables might impact the timing of revenue recognition, but would not change the total revenue recognized on the contract.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	The majority of engineering service contracts we have entered into, and consequently, the majority of service revenue we recognize, is associated with time and materials contracts.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	However, in the second quarter of 2009, we modified our contract with Ford Motor Company ( Ford ) from time and materials to fixed-price, which significantly increased the amount of revenue recognized from fixed-price contracts as a percentage of service revenue and as a percentage of total revenue.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P16_S2	This contract, as described further elsewhere in this filing, related to engineering services and other software we provided Ford relative to their development of their new in-dash infotainment system MyFord Touch.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P16_S3	Upon completion of the primary MyFord Touch development contract in August 2010, we modified our business arrangement with Ford to time and materials under which we continued to provide Ford with engineering services for the remainder of 2010 and expect to for 2011 as well.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P16_S4	Service revenue resulting from fixed-price contracts was 44% ($11.4 million) of service revenue in 2010, 37% ($9.3 million) in 2009 and 15% ($3.7 million) in 2008.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P16_S5	Ford accounted for $7.6 million of fixed-price service revenue in 2010, and $6.6 million in 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	As noted above, we primarily measure our estimate of completion on fixed-price contracts, which in turn determines the amount of revenue we recognize, based on actual hours incurred to date and our estimate of remaining hours necessary to complete the contract.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	The process of estimating the remaining hours on a contract involves detailed estimates of remaining hours by the engineers and project managers involved with the project, factoring in such variables as the remaining tasks, the complexity of the tasks, the contracted quality of the software to be provided, the customer s estimated delivery date, integration of third-party software and quality thereof and other factors.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	Every fixed-price contract requires various approvals within our Company including our Chief Executive Officer.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P18_S1	This approval process takes into consideration a number of factors including the complexity of engineering.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P18_S2	We do not enter into fixed bid contracts where we do not have a history of performing any material portion of the contracted engineering tasks successfully.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	Historically our estimation processes related to fixed-price contracts have been accurate based on the information known at the time of the reporting of our results.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	However, percentage-of-completion estimates require significant judgment.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we were delivering engineering services under nine fixed-price service contracts.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	The percentage of completion calculations on these contracts represents management s best estimates based on the facts and circumstances as of the filing of this report.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P20_S2	If there are changes to the underlying facts and circumstances, revisions to the percentage-of-completion calculations will be recorded in subsequent reporting periods.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P20_S3	If we were 20% under in our estimates of completion on every fixed-bid contract, our revenue would be over-stated by $490,000 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2010.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We record accounts receivable at the invoiced amount net of an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	We review the accounts receivable by amounts due by customers which are past due to identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P21_S2	In determining the amount of the reserve, we make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	Our stock-based compensation expense is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton ( BSM ) option-pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	The BSM model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and option life.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P22_S2	If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P22_S3	In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	To the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate, stock-based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	Incentive Compensation We make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions regarding the likelihood of our attainment, and the level thereof, of bonuses payable under our annual incentive compensation programs.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	We accrue bonuses and recognize the resulting expense when the bonus is judged to be reasonably likely to be earned as of year-end and is estimable.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P24_S2	The amount accrued, and expense recognized, is the estimated portion of the bonus earned on a year-to-date basis less any amounts previously accrued.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P24_S3	These estimates, judgments and assumptions are made quarterly based on available information and take into consideration our year-to-date actual results and expected results for the remainder of the year.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P24_S4	Because our attainment estimate factors estimated future results, significant judgment is required.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P24_S5	If actual results differ materially from our estimates, the amount of bonus expense recorded in a particular quarter could be significantly over or under estimated.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	Taxes As part of the process of preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the countries and other jurisdictions in which we operate.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	This process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P25_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P25_S3	Net operating losses and tax credits, to the extent not already utilized to offset taxable income, also give rise to deferred tax assets.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P25_S4	We must then assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income, and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P25_S5	Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P25_S6	Beginning in 2002 and through the third quarter of 2010, we maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P25_S7	During the years ended December 31, 2010 and, 2009 we utilized $5.1 million, and $0, respectively, of historical net operating losses to offset taxable income in each of those years.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P25_S8	At December 31, 2010, we had $61.7 million of net operating loss carryforward which will begin to expire in 2022, $54.9 million of which will expire in 2022 and 2023.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	In the fourth quarter of 2010, we determined that it was more likely than not that we would generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize a portion of our deferred tax assets and, as a result, recorded a $2.6 million reduction in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance and corresponding income tax benefit.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	In determining the amount of our deferred tax assets that we would realize as of December 31, 2010, we determined the largest amount of our deferred tax assets which had a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P26_S2	The factors we considered in reducing our deferred tax asset allowance included, but were not limited to: i) over the last three years we have generated cumulative pre-tax income of $3.1 million; ii), our analysis of normalized historical book pre-tax income which excluded those items not expected to occur in the future (e.g. realized losses on auction rate securities) indicated cumulative profitability over the same period; iii) we completed the main fixed-price Ford contract in August 2010 thereby eliminating the overrun risk which had previously significantly negatively affected our results; and iv) our assessment of existing customer contracts and agreements and the expected revenue and gross profit that could be reasonably expected therefrom.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	Because we do business in foreign tax jurisdictions, our sales may be subject to other taxes, particularly withholding taxes.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	The tax regulations governing withholding taxes are complex, causing us to have to make assumptions about the appropriate tax treatment.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P27_S2	Further, we make sales in many jurisdictions across the United States, where tax regulations are increasingly becoming more aggressive and complex.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P27_S3	We must therefore continue to analyze our state tax exposure and determine what the appropriate tax treatments are, and make estimates for sales, franchise, income and other state taxes.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	The following table presents certain financial data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	Our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	Our revenue is generated from the sale of software, both our own proprietary software and software of third parties that we resell, and the sale of engineering services.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P29_S2	Total revenue increased $32.4 million, or 50%, to $96.8 million in 2010, from $64.4 million in 2009 primarily due to an increase in third-party software sales.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P29_S3	Revenue from customers located outside of North America includes revenue attributable to our foreign operations, as well as software and services delivered to foreign customers from our operations located in North America.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P29_S4	During 2010, our international operations outside of North America consisted principally of operations in Taiwan.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P29_S5	We also have established relatively minor sales and/or support presences in China, India, Japan, Korea, and the United Kingdom.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P29_S6	Revenue from customers located outside of North America increased $12.5 million to $15.9 million in 2010, or 16% of total revenue, from $3.4 million, or 5% of total revenue, in 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	Microsoft Windows Mobile operating systems in the Asia Pacific ( APAC ) region in 2010 compared to none in the prior year, given that we entered into the distribution agreement initially in November 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	To a lesser extent, international growth in 2010 was attributable to an increase in engineering service revenue in Asia and Europe.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	Software revenue Software revenue consists of sales of third-party software and revenue from our own proprietary software products, which include software license sales, royalties from our software products, sales of our software development kits, support and maintenance revenue, as well as royalties from certain engineering service contracts.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	Software revenue for 2010 and 2009 was as follows (dollars in thousands):
1054721_11_ITEM7_P31_S2	The vast majority of our third-party software revenue is comprised of sales of Microsoft General Embedded operating systems ( General Embedded OS ) in North America and sales of Microsoft Windows Mobile operating systems ( Windows Mobile OS ) on a worldwide basis.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P31_S3	Third-party software sales increased $31.5 million, or 97%, in 2010 as compared to the prior year.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P31_S4	Primarily this increase is due to 55% higher sales volumes from our top ten General Embedded OS customers, as well as an approximate 29% increase in average sales volumes from our smaller General Embedded OS customers to pre-2009 levels.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P31_S5	We attribute much of this sales volume increase to the improved economic conditions in the United States, as well as a change made by Microsoft which now directs sales of certain Microsoft products through their embedded channel rather than other Microsoft channels.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P31_S6	Sales of General Embedded OS increased $20.8 million, or 70%, to $50.5 million in 2010, from $29.7 million in 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P31_S7	Sales of Windows Mobile OS were $10.2 million for 2010, compared to none in 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P31_S8	Proprietary software revenue increased $1.0 million, or 24%, in 2010 as compared to 2009 due primarily to growth in TestQuest product revenue driven by two significant licensing sales closed in the fourth quarter related to China Mobile Communications Corporation ( CMCC ).
1054721_11_ITEM7_P31_S9	These sales benefited the fourth quarter by $723,000 and were related to CMCC s initiative to monitor their network services by deploying handsets into 31 provinces across China, using our TestQuest Countdown product to test the deployed handsets.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P31_S10	While additional opportunities exist for selling TestQuest products to other mobile operators as a network monitoring solution, the timing of such sales are difficult to predict, and will likely happen infrequently, if at all.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P31_S11	Further, it should be noted that these TestQuest sales in the fourth quarter of 2010 are separate from our previously announced Handset Certification Platform, in which mobile operators utilize our TestQuest Countdown product to test pre-production handsets.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P31_S12	Total Test Quest licensing revenue increased $322,000 in 2010, compared to the prior year, while total TestQuest revenue, including TestQuest PCS revenue, increased by $866,000 in 2010 compared to the prior year.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P31_S13	Texas Instruments OMAP-related and Qualcomm Snapdragon-related revenue also contributed to the growth.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	Service revenue Service revenue for 2010 and 2009 was as follows (dollars in thousands):
1054721_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	Service revenue decreased nominally by $134,000, or 0%, in 2010 as compared to 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	North American service revenue declined $1.8 million to $25.0 million in 2010, from $26.8 million in 2009, primarily due to a $2.0 million decrease in service revenue related to Ford, offset by revenue increases related to other customers.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P33_S2	Ford continued to be our largest engineering services customer in 2010, representing 47% of service revenue, compared to 53% of service revenue in 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P33_S3	Ford contributed $12.9 million in service revenue in 2010 compared to $14.9 million in 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	We began working with Ford in the second quarter of 2008 assisting in the development of their next generation in-dash infotainment offering called MyFord Touch.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	Our initial project with Ford ran from the second quarter of 2008 and was completed in the third quarter of 2010.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P34_S2	During the initial project we provided hardware design and implementation, platform level software development, application level software development, quality assurance services and systems integration services.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P34_S3	Total service revenue recognized on the initial project was $22.0 million.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P34_S4	The contract underlying the initial project began as a time and material contract, and in the second quarter of 2009 it was converted to a fixed-price contract.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P34_S5	Since approximately the completion of the initial project, we have performed all services for Ford under a new time and materials contract which contains certain minimum commitments in terms of the number of resources we provide Ford, and amounts they pay us.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P34_S6	This new time and materials contract, called the Ford Telematics Competency Center ( FCC ), commits a certain number of engineering services personnel to Ford for a set fee.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P34_S7	The FCC represented $3.6 million of the 2010 Ford-related service revenue.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P34_S8	Since we completed the initial project, the number of engineers working on Ford programs has declined under the FCC because we are now primarily focused on developing and integrating new user applications for the MyFord Touch, enhancing existing applications and customizing the MyFord Touch platform for additional vehicle models.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P34_S9	In February 2011, we agreed with Ford, under a contract amendment, to expand the size of the FCC and to extend the term of the agreement to December 31, 2011.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P34_S10	Under this new agreement, we expect the FCC to generate $9.3 million in revenue in 2011.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P34_S11	Service revenue from the APAC region increased $1.4 million, or 170%, to $2.4 million in 2010 from $1.0 million in 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P34_S12	The higher revenue was primarily driven by several projects with new customers in Japan as well as higher revenue in the rest of the APAC region due to the improved economy there compared to 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P34_S13	Growth in the APAC region coupled with growth in Europe and growth in North America outside of Ford roughly offset the decline in Ford service revenue.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	Gross profit and gross margin Cost of revenue related to software revenue consists primarily of the cost of third-party software as well as the amortization of certain intangible assets related to acquisitions.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P35_S1	Cost of revenue related to service revenue consists primarily of salaries and benefits, contractor costs and re-billable expenses, plus related facilities and depreciation costs.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P35_S2	Gross profit on the sale of third-party software products was also positively affected by rebate credits of $804,000 in 2010 and $709,000 in 2009 from Microsoft which we earned through the achievement of defined objectives.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	The following table outlines software, services and total gross profit (dollars in thousands): Software gross profit and gross margin Software gross profit increased by $5.1 million, or 59%, in 2010, as compared to 2009, while software gross margin decreased by four percentage points.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	The increase in software gross profit, and the decline in gross margin, was primarily due to an increase in sales of our third-party software in 2010, primarily Microsoft General Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, on which we realize much lower gross margins , and resulting gross profit, than we realize with respect to our proprietary software.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P36_S2	Our third-party software margin was 15% in 2010, and 16% in 2009, compared to our proprietary software gross margin of 88% in 2010, and 86% in 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P36_S3	We currently expect third-party software sales to continue to be a significant percentage of our software revenue, and, therefore, our overall software gross margin will likely remain relatively low in the foreseeable future.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	Service gross profit and gross margin Service gross profit increased by $2.0 million, or 42%, in 2010 as compared to 2009, while service gross margin increased by seven percentage points to 24% in 2010, from 17% in 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P37_S1	The increase in service gross profit and gross margin was primarily due to overruns on the Ford project which negatively affected 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P37_S2	As the Ford project was accounted for under the percentage of completion method, the project overruns negatively affected the amount of revenue we recognized which, in turn, negatively affected our realized billing rate, gross profit, and gross margins.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	Operating expenses Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, commissions and bonuses for our sales personnel and related facilities and depreciation costs, as well as professional services fees (e.g., consulting, legal and audit).
1054721_11_ITEM7_P38_S1	Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $838,000, or 7%, to $12.9 million in 2010, from $12.0 million in 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P38_S2	Selling, general and administrative expenses represented 13% of our total revenue in 2010 compared to 18% of revenue in 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	2009 benefited from the reversal of our securities class action legal reserve in the third quarter of 2009 in the amount of $534,000.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	Excluding the impact of this reversal, selling, general and administrative expense increased in 2010 by $304,000, or 3%, from $12.5 million in 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P39_S2	This increase was driven by $220,000 in higher commissions and bonuses attributed to increased revenue, gross profit and net income and $372,000 in higher wage expense primarily due to the hiring of additional sales personnel, offset by decreases in a number of other expense items.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	Research and development Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for software development and quality assurance personnel, contractor and consultant costs, component costs and related facilities and depreciation costs.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P40_S1	Research and development expenses decreased $908,000, or 21%, to $3.4 million in 2010, from $4.3 million in 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P40_S2	Research and development expenses represented 4% of our total revenue in 2010, down from 7% in 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P40_S3	The decrease was driven by lower research and development expense associated with our Texas Instruments product initiatives, the majority of which were completed in the first quarter of 2010.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P40_S4	Additionally, we reduced research and development headcount during the year.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	Interest and other income (expense), net Other income (expense) consists of interest income on our cash, cash equivalents and investments, gains and losses we may recognize on our investments, as well as gains or losses on foreign exchange transactions.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	Other expense was $504,000 in 2010 compared to other income of $139,000 in 2009, representing a decrease of $643,000.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P41_S2	This increase was primarily due to a $549,000 other-than-temporary impairment loss on the carrying value of our auction rate security investments ( ARS ) that was charged to other expense during 2010.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	Income tax benefit Income tax benefit increased by $2.3 million to $2.4 million in 2010, from $76,000 in 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P42_S1	This increase was due primarily to a $2.6 million tax benefit recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2010 when we reevaluated the net carrying value of our deferred tax assets.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P42_S2	In prior periods, we had fully reserved our deferred tax assets as we had not been able to determine that it was more likely than not that we would generate sufficient future taxable income to realize these assets.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P42_S3	Deferred tax assets are evaluated quarterly and our valuation allowance may change in the future based upon our estimate of the probability of future taxable income.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P42_S4	Reductions in our valuation allowance will have a positive effect on our income tax provision while increases in our valuation allowance will have a negative effect.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2010, we had $23.1 million of cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and restricted cash, compared to $18.0 million at December 31, 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	These balances are net of a valuation allowance recorded against our ARS investments of $378,000 at December 31, 2010, and $686,000 at December 31, 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P43_S2	Of the $23.1 million of cash, investments and restricted cash at December 31, 2010, $1.0 million was classified as long-term, most of which relates to $875,000 restricted under the terms of our headquarters operating lease which is also classified as long-term restricted cash, the majority of which will continue to secure that obligation through its expiration in 2014.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P43_S3	Also included in long-term investments is an ARS investment with a par value of $500,000 recorded at estimated fair value of $122,000.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P43_S4	Our working capital was $20.0 million at December 31, 2010, compared to $10.3 million at December 31, 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P43_S5	Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.3 million in 2010, primarily attributable to $6.1 million in net income and $2.2 in non-cash expenses, offset in part by a negative change in various working capital line items.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P43_S6	Net cash provided by operating activities was $4.7 million in 2009, primarily attributable to a $3.3 million increase in deferred revenue primarily related to revenue billed but not earned on the Ford project and revenue deferred associated with annual support and maintenance contracts for TestQuest products.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P43_S7	Additionally, $1.8 million of non-cash expenses, and net collections of $1.5 million on our accounts receivable, contributed to net cash provided by operating activities in 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P43_S8	These amounts were offset in part by a net loss of $2.7 million in 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	Net cash used by investing activities was $7.7 million in 2010 primarily due to $19.5 million of purchases of short-term investments offset in part by $8.2 million in proceeds from the maturity of short-term investments and $3.8 million in sales of our ARS securities.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	Net cash provided by investing activities was $429,000 in 2009, primarily due to $750,000 in redemptions received on our ARS investments, offset in part by $278,000 in purchases of equipment and furniture.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P44_S2	Financing activities generated cash of $383,000 in 2010 and $10,000 in 2009 as a result of employees exercise of stock options.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P44_S3	We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments will be sufficient to meet our needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P44_S4	Cash Commitments We have the following future or potential cash commitments:
1054721_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	Under the terms of our corporate headquarters lease signed in February 2004, the landlord has the ability to demand payment for cash payments forgiven in 2004 if we default under the lease.
1054721_11_ITEM7_P45_S1	The amount of the forgiven payments for which the landlord can demand repayment was $900,000 at December 31, 2010, and decreases on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the lease, which expires in 2014.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Bsquare Corporation (the Corporation ) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity and cash flows for the years then ended.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P0_S1	These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation s management.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P0_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P0_S3	We conducted our audits in accordance with the auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1054721_11_ITEM8_P0_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P0_S5	The Corporation is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P0_S6	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P0_S7	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P1_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P1_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P1_S2	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Bsquare Corporation as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1054721_11_ITEM8_P6_S0	Description of Business and Accounting Policies Description of Business BSQUARE Corporation ( BSQUARE ) was incorporated in Washington State in July 1994.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P6_S1	We and our subsidiaries provide software and engineering services to companies that develop smart devices and to companies that assist others in developing smart devices.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P7_S0	A smart device is a dedicated purpose computing device that typically has a display, runs an operating system (e.g., Microsoft Windows CE) and may be connected to a network via a wired or wireless connection.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P7_S1	Examples of smart devices include set-top boxes, home gateways, point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, voting machines, gaming platforms, tablets, handheld data collection devices, personal media players, smart phones and devices targeted at automotive applications.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P7_S2	We primarily focus on smart devices that utilize embedded versions of the Microsoft Windows family of operating systems, specifically Windows CE, Windows XP Embedded and Windows Mobile .
1054721_11_ITEM8_P7_S3	However, as a result of acquisitions, coupled with our strategic intent to broaden our market focus, we provide software and engineering services to customers developing devices utilizing other operating systems such as Android and Linux.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P7_S4	Basis of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of BSQUARE Corporation and our wholly owned subsidiaries.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P7_S5	All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P7_S6	Reclassification of Previously Issued Financial Statements Fees payable to third-party software suppliers, such as Microsoft Corporation ( Microsoft ), were previously included in accounts payable and other accrued expenses at December 31, 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P7_S7	Such fees payable and accrued expenses have been reclassified into a new balance sheet line-item called Third-party software fees payable.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P7_S8	There was no impact on total current liabilities as of December 31, 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P7_S9	The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for 2009 was also revised to reflect this reclassification (there was no effect on net cash provided by operating activities).
1054721_11_ITEM8_P8_S0	Use of Estimates Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P8_S1	Examples include provisions for bad debts and income taxes, estimates of progress on professional engineering service arrangements and bonus accruals.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P8_S2	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P9_S0	Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P10_S0	Basic income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, and excludes any dilutive effects of common stock equivalent shares, such as options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and warrants.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P11_S0	Restricted stock awards ( RSAs ) are considered outstanding and included in the computation of basic income per share when underlying restrictions expire and the awards are no longer forfeitable.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P11_S1	Restricted stock units ( RSUs ), which vest over a period of two to four years, are considered outstanding and included in the computation of basic income per share only when vested.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P12_S0	Diluted income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock and if-converted method in the case of stock options and warrants, respectively.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P12_S1	Common stock equivalent shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is anti-dilutive.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P12_S2	Unvested but outstanding RSUs and RSAs which are forfeitable but outstanding are included in the diluted income per share calculation as well.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P13_S0	The following table presents a reconciliation of the number of shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted income per share (in thousands): Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments We invest our excess cash primarily in highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government agencies and municipalities, debt instruments issued by foreign government, corporate commercial paper, money market funds, and corporate debt securities.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P13_S1	We classify all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months as short-term investments.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P13_S2	Short-term investments consist entirely of marketable securities which are all classified as available-for-sale securities and are recorded at their estimated fair value.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P13_S3	We determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P13_S4	We may or may not hold securities with stated maturities greater than 12 months until maturity.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P13_S5	As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption short-term investments in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P13_S6	We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of stockholders equity, except for unrealized losses determined to be other than temporary which are recorded in other expense.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P14_S0	Restricted Cash Our restricted cash represents time deposits held at a financial institution as security for an outstanding letter of credit expiring in 2014 related to our corporate headquarters lease obligation.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P15_S0	Long-term Investments Our long-term investments consist of auction rate securities ( ARS ), which are recorded at their estimated fair value.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P15_S1	Financial Instruments and Concentrations of Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts receivable.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P15_S2	Cash equivalents and short-term investments consist primarily of highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government agencies and municipalities, debt instruments issued by foreign government, corporate commercial paper, money market funds, and corporate debt securities.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P15_S3	The carrying value of these instruments approximates fair value.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P16_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We record accounts receivable at the invoiced amount net of an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P16_S1	We review customers which are past due to identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P16_S2	In determining the amount of the reserve, we make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P16_S3	We account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P17_S0	We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three years.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P18_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful lives, ranging from 2 to 10 years.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P18_S1	Maintenance and repairs costs are expensed as incurred.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P19_S0	When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, gains or losses are included in the statement of operations.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P20_S0	When facts and circumstances indicate that the value of long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying value of the asset to projected undiscounted future cash flows.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P20_S1	Upon indication that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss as a charge against current operations based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P21_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets were recorded as a result of asset acquisitions and are stated at estimated fair value at the time of acquisition less accumulated amortization.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P22_S0	Amortization is provided on the straight-line method over estimated useful lives as follows:
1054721_11_ITEM8_P23_S0	4 years We review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P23_S1	We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P24_S0	If intangible assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P25_S0	We record all fees payable and accrued liabilities related to the sale of third-party software, such as Microsoft general embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, as third-party software fees payable.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P26_S0	Software Development Costs No software development costs have been capitalized as the cost has been immaterial.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P26_S1	Research and Development Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P26_S2	Advertising Costs All costs of advertising, including cooperative marketing arrangements, are expensed as incurred.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P26_S3	Advertising expense was $93,000 in 2010 and $149,000 in 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P27_S0	The estimated fair value of stock based awards is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the award, net of estimated forfeitures.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P28_S0	We estimate forfeitures of stock based awards based on historical experience and expected future activity.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P29_S0	The fair value of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P29_S1	The fair value of stock option awards are estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of each vesting tranche as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton ( BSM ) option-pricing model.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P29_S2	The BSM model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and option life.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P29_S3	If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P30_S0	Incentive Compensation We make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions regarding the likelihood of our attainment, and the level thereof, of bonuses payable under our annual incentive compensation programs.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P30_S1	We accrue bonuses and recognize the resulting expense when the bonus is judged to be reasonably likely to be earned as of year-end and is estimable.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P30_S2	The amount accrued, and expense recognized, is the estimated portion of the bonus earned on a year-to-date basis less any amounts previously accrued.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P30_S3	These estimates, judgments and assumptions are made quarterly based on available information and take into consideration our year-to-date actual results and expected results for the remainder of the year.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P30_S4	Because our attainment estimate factors estimated future results, significant judgment is required.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P30_S5	If actual results differ materially from our estimates, the amount of bonus expense recorded in a particular quarter could be significantly over or under estimated.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P31_S0	Comprehensive Income (Loss) Comprehensive income (loss) refers to net income (loss) and other revenue, expenses, gains and losses that, under generally accepted accounting principles, are recorded as an element of shareholders equity but are excluded from the calculation of net income (loss).
1054721_11_ITEM8_P31_S1	The changes in the components of other comprehensive income (loss) are as follows (in thousands):
1054721_11_ITEM8_P31_S2	The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss are as follows (in thousands):
1054721_11_ITEM8_P32_S0	Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P32_S1	Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P33_S0	under which deferred income taxes are provided for on the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P33_S1	Our deferred tax assets are measured using currently enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P33_S2	A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P33_S3	Beginning in 2002 and through the third quarter of 2010, we maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as we were unable to determine that it was more likely than not that we would generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize them.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P33_S4	The majority of our deferred tax assets relate to our net operating loss carryforwards.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P33_S5	At December 31, 2010, we had $59.2 million of net operating loss carryforwards which begin to expire in 2022, of which approximately $54.9 million will expire in 2022 and 2023.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P33_S6	Utilization of these carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation due to Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code which restricts the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use its net operating loss carryforwards.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P34_S0	An ownership change occurs if greater than five percent shareholders of an issuer s outstanding common stock collectively increase their ownership percentage by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P34_S1	We have performed analysis of possible ownership changes in the past which included consideration of a third-party study, and do not believe that an ownership change of more than 50 percentage points has occurred.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P35_S0	During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 we utilized approximately $5.6 million and $0, respectively, of net operating losses to offset taxable income.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P35_S1	In the fourth quarter of 2010, we determined that it was more likely than not that we would generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize a portion of our net operating losses and, as a result, we recorded a $2.6 million reduction in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance and corresponding income tax benefit.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P35_S2	In determining the amount of our net operating losses that we would realize as of December 31, 2010, we determined the largest amount of our deferred tax assets which had a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P35_S3	The factors we considered in reducing our deferred tax asset allowance included, but were not limited to: i) over the last three years we have generated cumulative pre-tax income of $3.1 million; ii), our analysis of normalized historical financial statement book pre-tax income which excluded those items not expected to occur in the future (e.g. realized losses on auction rate securities) indicated cumulative profitability over the same period; iii) we completed the main fixed-price Ford contract in August 2010 thereby eliminating the overrun risk which had previously significantly negatively affected our results; and iv) our assessment of existing customer contracts and agreements and the expected revenue and gross profit that could be reasonably expected therefrom.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P36_S0	Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions may be classified in the financial statements as either income taxes or interest and another expense classification.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P36_S1	We have elected to classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as income tax expense.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P36_S2	There are no interest and penalties included in income tax benefit in 2010 or 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P37_S0	The functional currency of foreign subsidiaries is the local currency.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P37_S1	Accordingly, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P37_S2	Resulting translation adjustments are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, a separate component of shareholders equity.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P38_S0	The net gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are recorded in the period incurred and were not significant for any of the periods presented.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P39_S0	been rendered; the selling price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P40_S0	Contracts and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P40_S1	Shipping documents and time records are generally used to verify delivery.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P40_S2	We assess whether the selling price is fixed or determinable based on the contract and/or customer purchase order and payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P40_S3	We assess collectability based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer s payment history.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P40_S4	Periodically, we will begin work on engineering service engagements prior to having a signed contract and, in some cases, the contract is signed in a quarter after which service delivery costs are incurred.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P40_S5	We do not defer costs associated with these uncontracted engagements.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P40_S6	We recognize software revenue upon shipment provided that no significant obligations remain on our part, substantive acceptance conditions, if any, have been met and the other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P41_S0	Service revenue from time and materials contracts, and training service agreements, is recognized as services are performed.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P41_S1	Fixed-price service agreements, and certain time and materials service agreements with capped fee structures, are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P41_S2	We use the percentage-of-completion method of accounting because it is the most accurate method to recognize revenue based on the nature and scope of these engineering service contracts; it is a better measure of periodic income results than other methods and it better matches revenue recognized with the costs incurred.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P41_S3	Percentage of completion is measured based primarily on input measures such as hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P41_S4	Significant judgment is required when estimating total hours and progress to completion on these arrangements which determines the amount of revenue we recognize as well as whether a loss is recognized if one is expected to be incurred for the remainder of the project.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P42_S0	Revisions to hour and cost estimates are incorporated in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P42_S1	We also enter into arrangements in which a customer purchases a combination of software licenses, engineering services and PCS.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P42_S2	As a result, contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting, including how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements if there are multiple elements.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P43_S0	PCS may include rights to upgrades, when and if available, telephone support, updates, and enhancements.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P44_S0	When VSOE of fair value exists for all elements in a multiple element arrangement, revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each of the elements.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P45_S0	VSOE of fair value is established by the price charged when the same element is sold separately.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P45_S1	Accordingly, the judgments involved in assessing the fair values of various elements of an agreement can impact the recognition of revenue in each period.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P45_S2	Changes in the allocation of the sales price between deliverables might impact the timing of revenue recognition, but would not change the total revenue recognized on the contract.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P46_S0	When elements such as software and engineering services are contained in a single arrangement, or in related arrangements with the same customer, we allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value, provided that such element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P46_S1	In the absence of fair value for a delivered element, revenue is first allocated to the fair value of the undelivered elements and then allocated to the residual delivered elements.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P46_S2	In the absence of fair value for an undelivered element, the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting, resulting in a delay of revenue recognition for the delivered elements until the undelivered elements are fulfilled.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P46_S3	As a result, contract interpretations and assessments of fair value are sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P47_S0	When engineering services and royalties are contained in a single arrangement, we recognize revenue from engineering services as earned in accordance with the criteria above even though the effective rate per hour may be lower than typical because the customer is contractually obligated to pay royalties on their device shipments.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P47_S1	We recognize royalty revenue, classified as software revenue, when the royalty report from the customer is received or when such royalties are contractually guaranteed and the revenue recognition criteria are met, particularly that collectability is reasonably assured.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P48_S0	In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU 2010-6, Improving Disclosures About Fair Value Measurements ( ASU 2010-6 ), which requires reporting entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair-value measurements including significant transfers into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair-value measurements and information on purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of Level 3 fair-value measurements.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P48_S1	ASU 2010-6 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for Level 3 reconciliation disclosures which are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P49_S0	The adoption of ASU 2010-6 did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statement disclosures.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P50_S0	Cash and Investments Cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, long-term investments and restricted cash consist of the following (in thousands):
1054721_11_ITEM8_P51_S0	We record our cash equivalents, short-term investments and ARS, at fair value.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P52_S0	Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P52_S1	As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P52_S2	A three-tier fair value hierarchy is established as a basis for considering such assumptions and for inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:
1054721_11_ITEM8_P53_S0	Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P54_S0	Level 2: Directly or indirectly observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs used in models or other valuation methodologies.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P55_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P55_S1	The inputs require significant management judgment or estimation.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P56_S0	Our short-term investments consist entirely of marketable securities classified as available for sale.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P56_S1	All short-term investments were valued based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from, or corroborated by, observable market data.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P56_S2	Our long-term investments consist entirely of ARS.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P56_S3	At December 31, 2010 we held $122,000 of ARS represented by one individual investment.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P57_S0	Historically, ARS have provided liquidity through a Dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre-determined intervals every 7 to 49 days.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P57_S1	However, these auctions began to fail in the first quarter of 2008.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P57_S2	The related principal amounts of the ARS will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, the issuer calls the security, or the security matures according to contractual terms.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P58_S0	Due to the lack of observable market quotes on our ARS, we have estimated their fair values using inputs including the underlying financial condition and credit quality of the issuer, the maturity of the security, and secondary market bid levels of similar and identical securities.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P58_S1	Based on these inputs, we estimated the fair value of our ARS to be $122,000 as of December 31, 2010, compared to a par value of $500,000.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P59_S0	We have classified our ARS as long-term investments as of December 31, 2010 due to our uncertainty as to when these securities will be sold.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P59_S1	The following table presents a reconciliation for our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), which entirely consist of ARS (in thousands):
1054721_11_ITEM8_P60_S0	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009 our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities primarily consisted of cash, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, money market funds and other investment grade securities.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P60_S1	Such amounts are recorded at fair value.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P60_S2	We had $1,000 of unrealized losses on our investments as of December 31, 2010, and $0 at December 31, 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P61_S0	The following table summarizes, by major security type, our assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):
1054721_11_ITEM8_P62_S0	Assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis, other than cash and restricted cash as of December 31, 2009, are summarized below (in thousands):
1054721_11_ITEM8_P63_S0	Equipment, Furniture and Leasehold Improvements Equipment, furniture, and leasehold improvements consist of the following (in thousands): Depreciation and amortization expense of equipment, furniture and leasehold improvements was $399,000 in 2010 and $384,000 in 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P63_S1	During 2010, obsolete equipment with a cost basis of $1.5 million, and a net book value of $7,000 was written off.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P64_S0	4. Intangible Assets Intangible assets relate to customer relationships, tradenames, trademarks and technology that we acquired from TestQuest in November 2008 and from NEC Corporation of America in December 2007.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P64_S1	The following table presents the gross carrying value of the acquired intangible assets subject to amortization and accumulated amortization thereof (in thousands):
1054721_11_ITEM8_P65_S0	As of December 31, 2010, 83% of the gross carrying value represented acquired technology while 76% of the net book value represented acquired technology.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P65_S1	Amortization expense was $463,000 and $506,000 for 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P65_S2	Amortization in future periods is expected to be as follows (in thousands):
1054721_11_ITEM8_P66_S0	Income Taxes Income (loss) before income taxes consists of the following (in thousands): Income tax benefit consists of the following (in thousands):
1054721_11_ITEM8_P67_S0	The components of net deferred tax assets consist of the following (in thousands):
1054721_11_ITEM8_P68_S0	The provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the applicable U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to pre-tax income, as a result of the following: Beginning in 2002 and through the third quarter of 2010, we maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as we were unable to determine that it was more likely than not that we would generate sufficient future taxable income for them to be realized.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P68_S1	In the fourth quarter of 2010, we determined that it was more likely than not that we would generate sufficient future taxable income to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets, and reduced our valuation allowance accordingly.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P68_S2	At December 31, 2010, we had approximately $61.7 million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, and $2.4 million of tax credit carryforwards, which begin to expire in 2022, and of which $54.9 million of the net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2022 and 2023.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P68_S3	Utilization of these carryforward may be subject to an annual limitation due to Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code which restricts the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use its carryforwards.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P69_S0	Under the applicable tax rules, an ownership change occurs if greater than five percent shareholders of an issuer s outstanding common stock, collectively, increase their ownership percentage by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P69_S1	We have performed analyses of possible ownership changes in the past, which included consideration of a third-party study, and do not believe that an ownership change of more than 50 percentage points has occurred.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P69_S2	We are no longer subject to U.S. federal tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2007, and with a few immaterial exceptions, we are also no longer subject to U.S. state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2007.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P70_S0	Our principal commitments consist of obligations outstanding under operating leases, which expire through 2014.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P70_S1	We have lease commitments for office space in Bellevue, Washington; San Diego, California; Longmont, Colorado; Chanhassen, Minnesota; Dallas, Texas; Taipei, Taiwan; Beijing, China and Nishi-Shinjuku, Japan.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P70_S2	We also lease office space in Akron, Ohio on a month-to-month basis.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P70_S3	Subsequent to December 31, 2010, we also signed a one-year lease for office space in Seoul, Korea.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P71_S0	Under the terms of our corporate headquarters lease signed in February 2004, if we default under the lease, the landlord has the ability to demand payment for cash payments forgiven in 2004.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P71_S1	The amount of the forgiven payments for which the landlord can demand repayment was $900,000 at December 31, 2010.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P72_S0	Rent expense was $1.5 million in 2010 and $1.5 million in 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P72_S1	As of December 31, 2010, we had $875,000 pledged as collateral for a bank letter of credit under the terms of our headquarters facility lease.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P72_S2	The pledged cash supporting the outstanding letter of credit is recorded as restricted cash.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P73_S0	Operating lease commitments at December 31, 2010 are as follows (in thousands): Legal Proceedings IPO Litigation In Summer and early Fall 2001, four shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company, certain of the Company s current and former officers and directors (the Individual Defendants ), and the underwriters of the Company s initial public offering (the Underwriter Defendants ).
1054721_11_ITEM8_P73_S1	The complaints were consolidated into a single action and a Consolidated Amended Complaint, which was filed on April 19, 2002.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P74_S0	The operative complaint alleged violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P74_S1	The suit purported to be a class action filed on behalf of purchasers of the Company s common stock during the period from October 19, 1999 to December 6, 2000.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P74_S2	The plaintiffs alleged that the Underwriter Defendants agreed to allocate stock in the Company s initial public offering to certain investors in exchange for excessive and undisclosed commissions and agreements by those investors to make additional purchases of stock in the aftermarket at pre-determined prices.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P74_S3	The plaintiffs alleged that the prospectus for the Company s initial public offering was false and misleading in violation of the securities laws because the Company did not disclose these arrangements.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P74_S4	The action sought damages in an unspecified amount.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P75_S0	On December 5, 2006, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals vacated a decision by the district court granting class certification in six of the coordinated cases, which are intended to serve as test, or focus cases.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P75_S1	The plaintiffs selected these six cases, which do not include the Company.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P75_S2	On April 6, 2007, the Second Circuit denied a petition for rehearing filed by the plaintiffs, but noted that the plaintiffs could ask the district court to certify more narrow classes than those that were rejected.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P75_S3	The parties in the approximately 300 coordinated cases, including the parties in the Company s case, reached a settlement in early 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P75_S4	As part of the settlement, the insurers for the issuer defendants will make the entire settlement payment on behalf of the issuers, including the Company.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P75_S5	On October 5, 2009, the district court granted final approval of the settlement.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P76_S0	Three objectors filed a petition to the Second Circuit seeking permission to appeal the district court s final approval order on the basis that the settlement class is broader than the class previously rejected by the Second Circuit in its December 5, 2006 order vacating the district court s order certifying classes in the focus cases.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P76_S1	Objectors to the settlement are proceeding with two appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P76_S2	Plaintiffs have moved to dismiss both appeals.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P76_S3	Following the district court s final approval of the settlement, the Company determined that it is unlikely that the Company will be liable for any damages that will not be paid for by the Company s insurance carriers, even if any appeals are successful.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P76_S4	As a result, it was determined that an accrued legal fees liability of $534,000 was no longer probable.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P76_S5	Consequently, this liability was reversed, which resulted in a reduction of selling, general and administrative expense during 2009.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P76_S6	However, due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, subsequent events could affect the assessment of this liability and this disclosure.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P77_S0	Shareholders Equity Stock Options We have a stock plan (the Plan ) under which stock options may be granted with a fixed exercise price that is typically fair market value on the date of grant.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P77_S1	These options have a term of up to 10 years and vest over a predetermined period, generally four years.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P77_S2	Incentive stock options granted under the Plan may only be granted to our employees, have a term of up to 10 years, and shall be granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P77_S3	The Plan also allows for awards of stock appreciation rights, restricted and unrestricted stock awards, and restricted stock units.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P77_S4	The Plan allows for an automatic annual increase in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan.

1054721_11_ITEM8_P80_S0	The fair value of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.

1054721_11_ITEM8_P80_S2	The BSM model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and option life.
1054721_11_ITEM8_P80_S3	If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.

1054721_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1054721_11_ITEM9A_P0_S1	In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our CEO and CFO, as of December 31, 2010, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.
1054721_11_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based upon this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2010.
1054721_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
1054721_11_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1054721_11_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act and includes those policies and procedures that: (a) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (b) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (c) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
1054721_11_ITEM9A_P1_S3	All internal controls, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
1054721_11_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
1054721_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010.
1054721_11_ITEM9A_P2_S1	In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in Internal Control Integrated Framework .

1054721_11_ITEM15_P33_S0	Exhibit 10.19 SCHEDULE TO EXHIBIT 10.19 BSQUARE CORPORATION FORM 10-K FOR THE ANNUAL PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 Filed herewith as Exhibit 10.19 to the Form 10-K for the annual period ended December 31, 2010, is a copy of the Microsoft OEM Windows Mobile Distribution Agreement between Microsoft Licensing, GP, an affiliate of Microsoft Corporation ( Microsoft ), and Bsquare Corporation (the Company ), entered into effective as of November 1, 2009, as amended by Amendment No. 1 dated as of September 1, 2010 and Amendment No. 2 dated as of November 1, 2010 (collectively, the Distribution Agreement ).
1054721_11_ITEM15_P33_S1	The Company has also entered into three additional distribution agreements, as amended, with Microsoft that are substantially identical in all material respects to the Distribution Agreement except as to the parties thereto, the dates of execution and other details, including the territories covered (the Additional Agreements ).
1054721_12_ITEM1_P0_S0	this Item regarding compliance by our directors, executive officers and holders of ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is included in our definitive proxy statement for our 2012 annual meeting of shareholders to be filed with the SEC under the caption Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance and is incorporated herein by this reference.
1054721_12_ITEM1_P0_S1	The remaining information required by this Item is included in our definitive proxy statement for our 2012 annual meeting of shareholders to be filed with the SEC under the caption Corporate Governance and is incorporated herein by this reference.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and the trading price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Microsoft-Related Risk Factors Due to the fact that we have historically provided software and services to customers building devices utilizing Microsoft s Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, as well as the fact that a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, Microsoft has a significant direct and indirect influence on our business.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P1_S3	The following represent several Microsoft-related risk factors which may negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	If we do not maintain our OEM and Windows Mobile Distribution Agreements with Microsoft or if Microsoft de-emphasizes or divests itself from these areas of its business, our revenue would decrease and our business would be adversely affected.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We have OEM Distribution Agreements ( ODA s) for Software Products for Embedded Systems with Microsoft, which enable us to sell Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems to our customers in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean (excluding Cuba), Mexico, the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P2_S2	These ODAs are effective through June 30, 2012.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P2_S3	We have also entered into other ODAs with Microsoft pursuant to which we are licensed to sell Microsoft Windows Mobile operating systems to customers in North America, South America, Central America, Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P2_S4	The ODAs to sell Windows Mobile Operating Systems are effective through June 30, 2012 and July 31, 2012.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P2_S5	We generated $58.4 million and $60.6 million of revenue in 2011 and 2010, respectively, through our sales of Microsoft operating systems and expect this revenue stream to continue in 2012.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P2_S6	If any of the ODAs are terminated by Microsoft (which Microsoft can do unilaterally) or not renewed, or if Microsoft decides to no longer invest in or to divest itself from these areas of its business, our software revenue and resulting gross profit could decrease significantly and our operating results would be negatively impacted.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P2_S7	Future renewals, if any, could be on less favorable terms, which could also negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Microsoft can change pricing under the ODAs at any time and recently announced a new pricing change for Windows Embedded operating systems which is currently scheduled to take effect March 1, 2012.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Microsoft could change its pricing structure again and, unless we are able to either pass through price increases to our customers or sign our customers to 12-month purchasing commitments, which lowers the price we pay to Microsoft, our revenue, gross profit and operating results would be negatively impacted.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Further, Microsoft currently offers a rebate program in conjunction with our ODA activities in which we earn money for achieving certain predefined objectives.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P3_S3	If Microsoft were to eliminate or negatively modify the rebate program, our gross profit and operating results would be negatively impacted.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P3_S4	We earned rebate credits from Microsoft of $746,000 and $804,000 in 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Microsoft has audited our records under the ODAs in the past and will likely audit our records again in the future and any negative audit results could result in additional charges and/or the termination of the ODAs.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P3_S6	There are provisions in the ODAs that require us to maintain certain internal records and processes for royalty auditing and other reasons.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P3_S7	Non-compliance with these and other requirements could result in the termination of the ODAs.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Microsoft has concluded an audits of our records pertaining to the ODA in 2009 and 2007, neither of which had material findings.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	It is possible that future audits could result in charges due to any material findings that are found.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	If we do not maintain our favorable relationship with Microsoft, we will have difficulty marketing and selling our software and services and may not receive developer releases of Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	As a result, our revenue and operating results could suffer.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P5_S2	We maintain a strategic marketing relationship with Microsoft.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P5_S3	If our relationship with Microsoft deteriorates for any reason, including an increased focus by us on customers building devices utilizing non-Microsoft Embedded or Mobile operating systems, our efforts to market and sell our software and services to OEMs and others could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Microsoft has significant influence over the development plans and buying decisions of OEMs and others utilizing Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems for smart devices and these targeted platforms are a significant focus for us.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P5_S5	Microsoft provides customer referrals to us.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P5_S6	Moreover, Microsoft controls the marketing campaigns related to its operating systems.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P5_S7	Microsoft s marketing activities, including trade shows, direct mail campaigns and print advertising, are important to the continued promotion and market acceptance of Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems and, consequently, to our sale of Windows-based software and services.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	must maintain a favorable relationship with Microsoft to continue to participate in joint marketing activities with them, which includes participating in partner pavilions at trade shows, listing our services on Microsoft s website, and receiving customer referrals.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In the event that we are unable to continue our joint marketing efforts with Microsoft, or fail to receive referrals from them, we would be required to devote significant additional resources and incur additional expenses to market our software products and services directly to potential customers.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	In addition, we depend on Microsoft for developer releases of new versions of, and upgrades to, Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile software in order to facilitate timely development and delivery of our own software and services.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P6_S3	If we are unable to maintain our favorable relationship with Microsoft and no longer continue receiving such new versions and updates, our revenue could decline significantly, and/or our costs could increase significantly, thereby negatively impacting our operating results.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Unexpected delays or announcement of delays by Microsoft related to product releases of Windows Embedded and/or Windows Mobile operating systems could adversely affect our revenue and operating results.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Unexpected delays or announcement of delays in Microsoft s delivery schedule for new versions of its Windows Embedded and/or Windows Mobile operating systems could cause us to delay our product introductions or impede our ability to sell our products and services and/or to complete customer projects on a timely basis.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P6_S6	Such delays, or announcements of delays, by Microsoft could also cause our customers to delay or cancel their project development activities or product introductions, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P6_S7	If Microsoft adds features to its Windows operating systems or develops products that directly compete with products and services we provide, our revenue and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P6_S8	As the developer of Windows, Windows Embedded Compact, Windows Embedded Standard, Windows Server, Windows Embedded Standard, Windows Embedded Compact, and Windows Mobile operating systems, Microsoft could add features which eliminate or reduce our customers need for our software and services, or Microsoft could develop standalone products and services that compete with the products and services we provide to our customers.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P6_S9	The ability of our customers, or potential customers, to obtain products and services directly from Microsoft that compete with our products and services could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P6_S10	Even if the standard features of future Microsoft operating system software were more limited than our offerings, a significant number of our customers, and potential customers, might elect to accept more limited functionality in lieu of purchasing additional software from us or delay the purchase of our products and services while they perform a comparison of Microsoft s competing offerings.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P6_S11	Moreover, the resulting competitive pressures could lead to price reductions for our offerings and reduce our revenue and gross profit accordingly and our operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P6_S12	If the markets for Windows Embedded and/or Windows Mobile operating systems fail to develop further, develop more slowly than expected, or decline, our business and operating results may be materially harmed.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P6_S13	Because a significant portion of our revenue to date has been generated by software and services targeted at customers and devices utilizing the Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, if the markets for these systems or platforms fail to develop further, or develop more slowly than expected, or decline, our business and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P6_S14	Market acceptance of Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile will depend on many factors, including:
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Microsoft s development and support of the Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile markets.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	In Motion Limited ( RIM and other proprietary operating systems.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	In particular, in the market for rugged handheld devices, Windows Mobile faces intense competition from the Android operating systems.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In the market for converged devices, Windows Embedded faces intense competition from the Android operating system.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The willingness of software developers to continue to develop and expand the applications that run on Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	To the extent that software developers write applications for competing operating systems that are more attractive to smart device users than those available on Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, potential customers could select competing operating systems over Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	MyFord Touch-Related Risk Factors If we do not obtain additional work on the MyFord Touch program through our new statement of work with Microsoft or elsewhere in the future our future revenue and gross profit would decrease and our operating results would be adversely affected.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We began working on the MyFord Touch infotainment project with Ford in the second quarter of 2008 and have been working on the program since then although the main program was completed in August 2010.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Since inception of the program through December 31, 2011, our contractual relationship was with Ford.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Effective January 1, 2012, our contractual relationship for the MyFord Touch program shifted from Ford to Microsoft, as Microsoft has become the primary vendor to Ford for this program.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Revenue from Ford comprised $9.7 million, or 10%, of our total revenue in 2011.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P10_S5	We expect this project work to continue in 2012 under our new statement of work with Microsoft but expect revenue from the MyFord Touch program to be lower, albeit still significant in 2012, than it was in 2011 due to the lower level of personnel resources utilized on the program.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P10_S6	Our new statement of work with Microsoft currently runs through June 30, 2012.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P10_S7	While expect to be actively involved in future projects with Microsoft and Ford beyond June 20, 2012, if our role on MyFord Touch is scaled back or eliminated beyond that point our revenue and resulting gross profit would suffer and negatively impact our operating results.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P10_S8	If we breach our agreement with Microsoft governing our work for Ford, or fail to comply with the requirements of the agreement, or are required to perform warranty repairs on any of the Ford vehicles into which our work is incorporated, or if any of those vehicles are recalled due to defects in our work, our revenue, operating results and overall business could be negatively impacted.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P10_S9	Our agreement with Microsoft governing our work for Ford on the MyFord Touch program provides customary representations and warranties and we accept liability for certain damages that are incurred as a result of our breach or failure to comply with the requirements of that agreement.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P10_S10	These damages may include consequential damages.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P10_S11	The agreement also provides that we will indemnify against certain third party claims.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P10_S12	In addition, warranty repairs on our work for Ford could require us to devote additional hours that would not be billable.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P10_S13	A significant warranty claim could require immediate remediation and consume a large amount of our billable resources until it is fixed, which could negatively impact our revenue, operating results and our business.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P10_S14	In addition, if a defect were significant enough to require a vehicle recall, the costs of such a recall could be significant.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We have increased our overall insurance amounts, but many claims, including, but not limited to, warranty and recall related issues, may not be covered by insurance.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	General Business-Related Risk Factors Our marketplace is extremely competitive, which may result in price reductions, lower gross profit margins and loss of market share.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The market for our software products and related services is extremely competitive.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Increased competition may result in lower revenue, price reductions, lower gross profit and margin and loss of customers and market share, which could negatively impact our operating results.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Mobile and embedded test automation providers including Perfecto Mobile, mVerify, JAMO Solutions, SmartBear Software (AutomatedQA), TestPlant (eggPlant) and Keynote.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Microsoft Windows Mobile operating system distributors who began competing with us in our approved regions in 2011 such as Avnet in the Americas; Synnex Corporation in Taiwan; and MDS Technology Co., Ltd in Korea.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Some of our competitors focus on only one aspect of our business or offer complementary products which can be integrated with our products.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P14_S2	As we develop and bring to market new software products and service offerings, particularly offerings focused on specific industries and/or focused on devices utilizing non-Windows Embedded operating systems, we may begin competing with companies with which we have not previously competed.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Further, as we expand the geographic markets into which we sell our software solutions and related services, we may expect to increasingly compete with companies with which we have not previously competed.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P14_S4	It is also possible that new competitors will enter the market or that our competitors will form alliances, including alliances with Microsoft, that may enable them to rapidly increase their market share.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Microsoft has not agreed to any exclusive arrangement with us, nor has it agreed not to compete with us.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Microsoft may decide to bring more of the core embedded development services and expertise that we provide in-house, possibly resulting in reduced software and service revenue opportunities for us.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The barrier to entering the market as a provider of Windows-based smart device software and services is low.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In addition, Microsoft has created marketing programs to encourage systems integrators to work on Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating system software and services.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P15_S2	These systems integrators are given substantially the same access by Microsoft to the Windows technology as we are.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P15_S3	New competitors may have lower overhead than we do and may be able to undercut our pricing.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P15_S4	We expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter the Windows-based smart device market, and as new products and technologies are introduced.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Our ability to maintain or grow our proprietary software revenue is contingent on our ability to bring to market competitive, unique offerings that keep pace with technological changes and needs.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P15_S6	If we are not successful in doing so, our business would be negatively impacted.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Proprietary software product sales provide us with much higher gross profit margins than we typically receive from third-party software products and our engineering service offerings and provide other advantages as well.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our ability to maintain and increase the revenue contribution from proprietary software products is contingent on our ability to enhance the features and functionality of our current proprietary products as well as to devise, develop and introduce new products.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or expand the number of proprietary products that we sell, and our failure to do so could negatively impact revenue and our operating results.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We may experience delays in our efforts to develop new products and services, and these delays could cause us to miss market opportunities which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The market for our software and services evolves rapidly.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P18_S1	As a result, the life cycles of our products and services are difficult to estimate.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P18_S2	To be successful, we believe we must continue to enhance our current offerings and provide new software and service offerings with attractive features, prices and terms that appeal to our customers.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P18_S3	We have experienced delays in new software and service offering introductions in the past and may do so again in the future.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Our revenue and operating results may be negatively impacted if we delay releases of new products, product enhancements and/or new services offerings, or if we fail to accurately anticipate our customers needs or technical trends and are unable to introduce new products and service offerings into the market successfully.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P18_S5	In addition, our customers may defer or forego purchases of our products and/or services if we, Microsoft, our competitors or major hardware, systems or software vendors introduce or announce new products.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Our future success depends upon our customers ability to successfully sell their products incorporating our technology, and to continue buying our services.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P18_S7	Even if a customer selects us to provide software and services, the customer may not ultimately market and sell its product successfully.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P18_S8	A cancellation or change in plans by a customer, whether from lack of market acceptance of its products or otherwise, could cause us to lose revenue that we had anticipated and our revenue and operating results would suffer.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P18_S9	Also, our revenue and operating results could suffer if a significant customer reduces or delays orders during our sales cycle or chooses not to release products that contain our technology.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P18_S10	If the market for smart devices grows more slowly than we expect, or declines, our revenue may not grow as anticipated, if at all, and our business would be harmed.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P18_S11	The market for smart devices is still in fluctuation and the potential size of this market and the timing of its development are not known.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P18_S12	As a result, our profit potential is uncertain and our revenue may not develop as anticipated.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P18_S13	We are dependent upon the broad acceptance and adoption by businesses and consumers of a wide variety of smart devices, which will depend on many factors, including:
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The amount of discretionary funds companies and individuals have to spend for this kind of technology.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The success and profitability of our service offerings are contingent on our ability to differentiate these offerings adequately in the marketplace, which is, in turn, contingent on our ability to retain our engineering personnel and defend our billing rate structure against those of our competitors, including those using lower-cost offshore resources.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	If we are unable to do so successfully, our business could be harmed.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We are a leader in providing engineering services to smart device customers.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Our market differentiation is created through several factors, including our experience with a variety of smart device platforms and applications.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Our differentiation is contingent, in part, on our ability to attract and retain employees with this expertise, a significant portion of which are currently based in the United States.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P20_S5	To the extent we are unable to retain critical engineering services talent and/or our competition is able to deliver the same services by using lower-cost offshore resources, our service revenue and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P20_S6	The success and profitability of our service engagements are contingent upon our ability to scope and bid engagements and deliver our services profitably.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P20_S7	If we are unable to do so, our service revenue service gross profit margin and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Various factors may cause the total cost of service projects to exceed the original estimate provided to the customer or the contractual maximum in the case of fixed price contracts, including specification changes, customer deliverable delays, inadequate scoping and inefficient service delivery.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P21_S1	If we are unable to adequately scope, bid and deliver on service engagements successfully, our service revenue, service gross margin and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P21_S2	In addition, depending on the cause of an overrun for a given customer and project, we may also decide to provide pricing concessions to that customer which could negatively impact our service revenue, service gross profit and operating results.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We periodically enter into engineering service agreements in which we have agreed to perform our engineering service work for lower up-front fees, or for no fees, in exchange for future royalties or per unit fees.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	There is no guarantee that these arrangements will produce the strategic or economic returns as anticipated.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P22_S2	We have entered into contracts that involve reducing or eliminating up-front engineering service fees in return for a per-device/chip royalty or fee that is earned as our customers ship their devices or chips, and we may enter into more such agreements in the future.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Because we are delaying revenue past the point where our services are performed, there is a risk that our customers may cancel their projects or that their devices or chips may not be successful in the market, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Cooperation and support from silicon vendors is critical for the success of our products and related services that are developed for their particular silicon architecture.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P22_S5	We have developed, and continue to develop, software and service offerings based on certain silicon architectures (e.g. the TI OMAP architecture).
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Due to the nature of the industry we serve and the products we develop, it is necessary for us to make certain assumptions regarding which silicon vendors will be successful in the various markets we serve and upon which we are making investments.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	It is therefore important that there is ongoing support from the SVs in the marketplace for these silicon architectures.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P23_S2	For example, during the development of a reference design board, Intel made a strategic decision to sell its PXA Xscale division to Marvell which negatively impacted the sale of our Xscale-based reference designs.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P23_S3	There can be no assurance that Marvell, TI, or any of the other SVs will continue to pursue and support the markets that we have been targeting.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P23_S4	If the SVs do not support our efforts going forward, our revenue and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The long sales cycle of our products and services makes our revenue susceptible to fluctuations.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Our sales cycle is typically three to nine months because the expense and complexity of the software and service offerings we sell generally require a lengthy customer approval process and may be subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control, including:
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The timing of customers competitive evaluation processes.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P25_S1	In addition, to successfully sell our software and engineering service offerings, we must frequently educate our potential customers about the full benefits of our software and services, which can require significant time.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P25_S2	If our sales cycle further lengthens unexpectedly, it could adversely affect the timing of our revenue, which could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Erosion of the financial condition of our customers could adversely affect our business.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Our business could be adversely affected if the financial condition of our customers erodes because such erosion could reduce demand from those customers for our software and engineering services.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P25_S5	This could also cause them to terminate their relationships with us, and/or could increase the risk that such customers default on their payment obligations to us.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P25_S6	Additionally, while we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate, economic trends may cause more companies to default or cease operations, in which case our allowances may not cover actual losses, which could adversely affect our operating results.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P25_S7	We may be subject to product liability claims that could result in significant costs.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P25_S8	Our software license and service agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims with the notable exception of the portion of the MyFord Touch project contracted with Ford.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P25_S9	It is possible, however, that these provisions may be ineffective under the laws of certain jurisdictions or that our customers may not agree to these limitations.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P25_S10	Although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date, the sale and support of our products and services may be subject to such claims in the future.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P25_S11	There is a risk that any such claims or liabilities may exceed, or fall outside, the scope of our insurance coverage, and we may be unable to retain adequate liability insurance in the future.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P25_S12	A product liability claim brought against us, whether successful or not, could negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P25_S13	Negative business conditions, changes in useful lives, and other factors may negatively affect the carrying value of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P25_S14	In the fourth quarter of 2008, we purchased certain assets of TestQuest including acquired technology and other intangible assets with a total gross carrying value of $1.9 million, and which have a carrying value of $197,000 as of December 31, 2011.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P25_S15	In the third quarter of 2011, we acquired MPC Data Limited including certain intangible assets with a carrying value of $1.2 million and goodwill of $3.7 million as of December 31, 2011.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P25_S16	Although we expect to generate cash from the intangible assets in the future, and do not foresee any impairment of our goodwill, it is possible that we may be required to reassess the carrying value of these assets in the future if certain negative business conditions occur such as negative results of our business associated with our intangible assets or a low stock price.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P25_S17	Any reduction in the carrying value of these intangible assets or goodwill would result in an impairment charge that would negatively impact our operating results.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P25_S18	Further, business conditions and other factors may also require us to reassess the useful lives associated with intangible assets.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2011, we assessed that the net carrying value of the remaining intangible assets associated with acquired technology from TestQuest was impaired due to this technology no longer being used in our product offerings.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P26_S1	As such, we recognized an impairment charge of $518,000 as software cost of revenue which negatively impacted our gross profit and operating results.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Past acquisitions have proven difficult to integrate, and recent or future acquisitions, if any, could disrupt our business, dilute shareholder value and negatively affect our operating results.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We have acquired the technologies, assets and/or operations of other companies in the past and may acquire or make investments in companies, products, services and technologies in the future as part of our growth strategy.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	If we fail to properly evaluate, integrate and execute on our acquisitions and investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P27_S2	To successfully complete an acquisition, we must properly evaluate the technology, market and management team, accurately forecast the financial impact of the transaction, including accounting charges and transaction expenses, integrate and retain personnel, combine potentially different corporate cultures and effectively integrate products and research and development, sales, marketing and support operations.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P27_S3	If we fail to do any of these, we may suffer losses and impair relationships with our employees, customers and strategic partners.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P27_S4	Additionally, management may be distracted from day-to-day operations.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P27_S5	We also may be unable to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, which are especially critical in light of Sarbanes-Oxley and other corporate governance requirements, and significant demands may be placed on our management and our operations, information services and financial, legal and marketing resources.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P27_S6	Finally, acquired businesses sometimes result in unexpected liabilities and contingencies, which may involve compliance with foreign laws, payment of taxes, labor negotiations or other unknown costs and expenses, which could be significant.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We may not be able to raise additional capital if required to support our business.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	If we need to raise additional operating capital, we may find that our access to equity and debt capital markets is limited or blocked entirely.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P28_S2	In the past, our stock has traded at low volumes and overall investor confidence in the stock market could falter.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P28_S3	This could make it difficult or impossible to sell additional shares on the public markets.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P28_S4	In addition, it may be difficult and costly to obtain debt financing and we may be unable to borrow additional funds at acceptable cost, or at all, should the need arise.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P28_S5	If we are unable to raise capital as necessary, it may adversely affect our ability to invest in products or fund operations, which would materially harm our business and negatively affect operating results.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P28_S6	We are dependent on our insurance carriers to cover certain risks and a failure of one or more of our carriers, a tightening of the market that increases our costs or decreases our ability to obtain necessary coverage, or the denial of a claim could negatively impact our business.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P28_S7	We have added significant additional insurance to cover the additional exposure presented by our work for Ford on the MyFord Touch program and other customers.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P28_S8	While all of our insurance carriers appeared to be viable as of the date of this Annual Report, if this changes, or we are unable to maintain current coverage through viable insurance carriers at reasonable rates, or we are unable to obtain additional coverage that we deem necessary for our business, or if a carrier denies a claim, we may be unable to meet our financial obligations if claims that would otherwise have been covered by this insurance are made which could negatively impact our financial condition and operating results.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Taxing jurisdictions in the United States are becoming more aggressive with tax legislation and tax collection, particularly states facing significant budget deficits, which could expose us to additional tax liability that we have not been subject to in the past.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We make sales in many jurisdictions across the United States, most of which we do not have nexus in and, therefore, are not subject to sales, franchise, income and other state and local taxes.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	could result in us achieving nexus, or potentially achieving nexus in significantly more tax jurisdictions.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P30_S1	If this occurs and unless we are able to pass through this cost to our customers, our tax expense will increase which will negatively affect our results of operations.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Further, because state and local tax laws are becoming increasingly complex, our cost to monitor our state and local tax compliance will increase which will negatively affect our results of operations.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Additionally, there can be no assurance that we do not currently have unknown tax exposure in a state or local tax jurisdiction because of recent tax law changes which we are unaware of and the resulting liability could be significant and would negatively affect our results of operations.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	There may be restrictions on the use of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards due to a tax law ownership change.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code restricts the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P32_S1	At December 31, 2011, we had approximately $59.2 million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, and $2.6 million of tax credit carryforwards.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Under the applicable tax rules, an ownership change occurs if greater than five percent shareholders of an issuer s outstanding common stock collectively increase their ownership percentage by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We have performed analyses of possible ownership changes which included consideration of a third-party study, and do not believe that an ownership change (as defined by this Section) has occurred.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P33_S2	However, if a tax law ownership change has occurred of which we are not aware, or if a tax law ownership change occurs in the future, we may have to adjust the valuation of our deferred tax assets, and could be at risk of having to pay income taxes notwithstanding the existence of our sizable carryforwards.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Further, to the extent that we have utilized our carryforwards from prior years, the existence of a previous tax law ownership change that we did not account for could result in liability for back taxes, interest, and penalties.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Non-compliance with our lease agreement could have a material adverse impact on our financial position.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P33_S5	Under the terms of our corporate headquarters lease signed in February 2004, if we default under the lease, the landlord has the ability to demand cash payments forgiven in 2004.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P33_S6	The amount of the forgiven payments for which the landlord has the ability to demand repayment was $640,000 at December 31, 2011, and decreases on a straight-line basis over the length of our ten-year headquarters lease.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P33_S7	Any breach of or non-compliance with this lease agreement could negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P33_S8	Intellectual Property-Related Risk Factors Our software and service offerings could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which could expose us to additional costs and litigation and could adversely affect our ability to sell our products and services or cause shipment delays or stoppages.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P33_S9	It is difficult to determine whether our software and engineering services infringe third-party intellectual property rights, particularly in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which technologies often overlap and where there may be numerous patent applications pending, many of which are confidential when filed.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P33_S10	If we were to discover that one of our software or service offerings, or a product based on one of our reference designs, violated a third-party s proprietary rights, we may not be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, to continue offering that product or service.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P33_S11	Similarly, third parties may claim that our current or future software products and services infringe their proprietary rights, regardless of whether such claims have merit.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P33_S12	Any such claims could increase our costs and negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	In certain cases, we have been unable to obtain indemnification against claims that third-party technology incorporated into our software products and services infringe the proprietary rights of others.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P34_S1	However, any indemnification we do obtain may be limited in scope or amount.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Even if we receive broad third-party indemnification, these entities may not have the financial capability to indemnify us in the event of infringement.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P34_S3	In addition, in some circumstances we are required to indemnify our customers for claims made against them that are based on our software products or services.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	related to the software products and services we provide, or arising from the incorporation by us of third-party technology, and claims for indemnification from our customers resulting from such claims, will not be asserted or prosecuted against us.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Some of our competitors have, or are affiliated, with companies with substantially greater resources than we have, and these competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than we could.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P35_S2	In addition, we expect that software developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the software industry grows, and as the functionality of products in different industry segments increasingly overlap.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Such claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources in addition to potential product redevelopment costs and delays.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P35_S4	Furthermore, if we were unsuccessful in resolving a patent or other intellectual property infringement action claim against us, we may be prohibited from developing or commercializing certain of our technologies and products, or delivering services based on the infringing technology, unless we obtain a license from the holder of the patent or other intellectual property rights.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P35_S5	There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain any such license on commercially favorable terms, or at all.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P35_S6	If such license is not obtained, we would be required to cease these related business operations, which could negatively impact our business, revenue and operating results.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P35_S7	If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may be able to use our technology or trademarks, which could weaken our competitive position, reduce our revenue and increase our costs.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P35_S8	If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, our competitive position could be weakened and our revenue and operating results adversely affected.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P35_S9	We rely primarily on confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions as well as a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, to protect our intellectual property.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P35_S10	These laws and procedures provide only limited protection.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P35_S11	It is possible that another party could obtain patents that block our use of some, or all, of our software and services.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P35_S12	If that occurred, we would need to obtain a license from the patent holder or design around those patents.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P35_S13	The patent holder may or may not choose to make a license available to us at all, or on acceptable terms.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P35_S14	Similarly, it may not be possible to design around a blocking patent.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P35_S15	In general, there can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws will be effective to prevent misappropriation of our technology, or to prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to or competitive with those developed by us.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We frequently license the source code of our software products and the source code results of our services to customers.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P36_S1	There can be no assurance that customers with access to our source code will comply with the license terms or that we will discover any violations of the license terms or, in the event of discovery of violations, that we will be able to successfully enforce the license terms and/or recover the economic value lost from such violations.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	To license some of our software products, we rely in part on shrinkwrap and clickwrap licenses that are not signed by the end user and, therefore, may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P37_S1	As with other software, our software products are susceptible to unauthorized copying and uses that may go undetected, and policing such unauthorized use is difficult.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	A significant portion of our marks include the word BSQUARE.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Other companies use forms of BSQUARE in their marks alone, or in combination with other words, and we cannot prevent all such third-party uses.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We license certain trademark rights to third parties.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Such licensees may not abide by our compliance and quality control guidelines with respect to such trademark rights.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Any of these outcomes could negatively impact our brand, dilute its recognition in the marketplace, or confuse potential customers, all of which could harm our business.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The computer software market is characterized by frequent and substantial intellectual property litigation, which is often complex and expensive, and involves a significant diversion of resources and uncertainty of outcome.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property or to defend against a claim of infringement or invalidity.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Litigation could result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources and could negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Our software or hardware products or the third-party hardware or software integrated with our products or delivered as part of our service offerings may suffer from defects or errors that could impair our ability to sell our products and services.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Software and hardware components as complex as those needed for smart devices frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P41_S2	We have had to delay commercial release of certain versions of our products until problems were corrected and, in some cases, have provided product enhancements to correct errors in released products.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Some of our contracts require us to repair or replace products that fail to work.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P41_S4	To the extent that we repair or replace products our expenses may increase.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P41_S5	In addition, it is possible that by the time defects are fixed, the market opportunity may decline which may result in lost revenue.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P41_S6	Moreover, to the extent that we provide increasingly comprehensive products and services, particularly those focused on hardware, and rely on third-party manufacturers and suppliers to manufacture these products, we will be dependent on the ability of third-party manufacturers to correct, identify and prevent manufacturing errors.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P41_S7	Errors that are discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance, diversion of development resources, damage to our reputation and increased service and warranty costs, all of which could negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P41_S8	If we are unable to license key software from third parties, our business could be harmed.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P41_S9	We sometimes integrate third-party software with our proprietary software and engineering service offerings or sell such third-party software offerings on a standalone basis (e.g. Windows Embedded operating systems under our ODA with Microsoft).
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P41_S10	If our relationships with these third-party software vendors were to deteriorate, or be eliminated in their entirety, we might be unable to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P41_S11	In the event that we are unable to obtain these third-party software offerings, we would be required to develop this technology internally, assuming it was economically or technically feasible, or seek similar software offerings from other third parties assuming there were competing offerings in the marketplace, which could delay or limit our ability to introduce enhancements or new products, or to continue to sell existing products and engineering services, thereby negatively impacting our revenue and operating results.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Governance-Related Risk Factors It might be difficult for a third-party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation, bylaws and Washington law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in the control of us or a change in our management, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Our Board of Directors has the authority under our amended and restated articles of incorporation to issue preferred stock with rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P42_S3	As a result, preferred stock could be issued quickly and easily with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make removal of our management more difficult.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P42_S4	In addition, our Board of Directors is divided into three classes.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P42_S5	The directors in each class serve for three-year terms, one class being elected each year by our shareholders.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P42_S6	This system of electing and removing directors may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company because it generally makes it more difficult for shareholders to replace a majority of our directors.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P42_S7	In addition, Chapter 19 of the Washington Business Corporation Act generally prohibits a target corporation from engaging in certain significant business transactions with a defined acquiring person for a period of five years after the acquisition, unless the transaction or acquisition of shares is approved by a majority of the members of the target corporation s Board of Directors prior to the time of acquisition.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P42_S8	This provision may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of our company.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P42_S9	The existence of these anti-takeover provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P43_S0	International Operations-Related Risk Factors Our international operations expose us to greater intellectual property, management, collections, regulatory and other risks.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Customers outside of North America generated 23% of our total revenue in 2011 and 16% in 2010.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P43_S2	We have expanded rapidly internally during 2011 and 2010 including establishing presences in Korea and China and our MPC acquisition in September 2011 which significantly increased our presence in EMEA.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P43_S3	We currently have operations outside of North America in Taiwan, China and the United Kingdom and also have a limited sales and/or support presence in Japan and South Korea.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P43_S4	Our international activities and operations, and our current expansion plans expose us to a number of risks, including the following:
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Complex and/or adverse tax laws and/or changes thereto.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The inherent risks of working in a certain highly regulated and/or controlled economies where relationships between company management and government officials is critical to timely processing of approvals required to conduct business.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P45_S1	These risks could have a material adverse effect on the financial and managerial resources required to operate our foreign offices, as well as on our future international revenue, which could negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P45_S2	As we increase the amount of software development conducted in non-U.S. locations, potential delays and quality issues may impact our ability to timely deliver our software and services, potentially impacting our revenue and profitability.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P45_S3	We conduct development activities in non-U.S. locations, primarily India (through a partnership with a local company), China, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom, to take advantage of the high-quality, low-cost software development resources found in those countries.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P45_S4	Additionally, we have plans to further increase development activity in our Taiwan and China operations.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P45_S5	To date, we have limited experience in managing large scale software development outside the United States.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P46_S0	revenue we recognize from related software products and services and could also adversely impact the profitability of service engagements employing offshore resources, thereby negatively affecting our operating results.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P46_S1	As our customers seek more cost-effective locations to develop and manufacture their smart devices, particularly overseas locations, our ability to continue to sell these customers our software products and services could be limited, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Due to competitive and other pressures, some of our customers have moved, and others may seek to move, the development and manufacturing of their smart devices to overseas locations, which may limit our ability to sell these customers our software and services.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P46_S3	As an example, under our ODA with Microsoft, we are currently only able to sell Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems primarily in North America, the United Kingdom and Germany.
1054721_12_ITEM1A_P46_S4	If our customers, or potential customers, move their manufacturing overseas we may be restricted from reselling these customers Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems, or our other products and services, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	In North America, we also lease office space in San Diego, California; Longmont, Colorado; Boston, Massachusetts; Chanhassen, Minnesota; Akron, Ohio; and Dallas, Texas.
1054721_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	We lease office space overseas in Beijing, China, Seoul, Korea, Tokyo, Japan, Taipei, Taiwan, and Trowbridge, United Kingdom.
1054721_12_ITEM2_P0_S2	Our facilities have sufficient capacity to support our current operational needs as well as short-term growth plans.
1054721_12_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol BSQR.
1054721_12_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table sets forth the high and low closing prices for our common stock for the periods indicated, as reported by the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
1054721_12_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of January 31, 2012, there were 139 holders of record of our common stock.
1054721_12_ITEM5_P1_S1	Because many shares of our common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of shareholders, we are unable to determine the total number of shareholders represented by these holders of record.
1054721_12_ITEM5_P1_S2	Dividends We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock.
1054721_12_ITEM5_P1_S3	We currently intend to retain any future earnings to fund future development and growth and, therefore, do not anticipate paying any consistent cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1054721_12_ITEM5_P1_S4	Our Board of Directors has, however, periodically considered implementing a share repurchase program and/or a special one-time cash dividend.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P0_S1	Some statements and information contained in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are not historical facts but are forward-looking statements.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P0_S2	For a discussion of these forward-looking statements, and of important factors that could cause results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this report, see Item 1 of Part I, Business Forward-Looking Statements, and Item 1A of Part I, Risk Factors.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	We provide software solutions and related engineering services to companies that develop smart, connected devices.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	A smart, connected device is a dedicated purpose computing device that typically has a display, runs an operating system (e.g., Microsoft Windows Embedded Compact) and may be connected to a network via a wired or wireless connection.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P2_S1	Examples of smart devices include set-top boxes, home gateways, point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, voting machines, gaming platforms, tablets, handheld data collection devices, personal media players, smart phones and devices targeted at automotive applications.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P2_S2	We focus on smart devices that utilize embedded versions of the Microsoft Windows family of operating systems, specifically Windows Embedded Compact, Windows Embedded Standard and Windows Mobile as well as devices running other popular operating systems such as Android, Linux, and QNX.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	We have been providing software solutions to the smart device marketplace since our inception.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	Our customers include world class original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ), original design manufacturers ( ODMs ) and enterprises, as well as silicon vendors ( SVs ) and peripheral vendors which purchase our software solutions for purposes of facilitating processor and peripheral sales to the aforementioned customer categories.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P3_S2	In the case of enterprises, our customers include those which develop, market and distribute smart devices on their own behalf as well as those that purchase devices from OEMs or ODMs and require additional device software or testing.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P3_S3	The software solutions we provide are utilized and deployed throughout various phases of our customers device life cycle, including design, development, customization, quality assurance and deployment.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in our financial statements and the accompanying notes.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts, percentage of completion on fixed-price service contracts, fair values of financial instruments, deferred tax asset allowances, useful lives and fair value of intangible assets and property and equipment, fair values of stock-based awards, income tax accruals, fair values of acquired assets and liabilities and the fair value of contingent purchase consideration, among other estimates.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P4_S3	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	We recognize revenue from software and engineering service sales when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the selling price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	Contracts and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	and time records are generally used to verify delivery.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	We assess whether the selling price is fixed or determinable based on the contract and/or customer purchase order and payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	We assess collectability based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer s payment history.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P7_S2	Periodically, we will begin work on engineering service engagements prior to having a signed contract and, in some cases, the contract is signed in a quarter after which service delivery costs are incurred.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P7_S3	We do not defer costs associated with such engagements before we have received a signed contract.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P7_S4	We recognize software revenue upon shipment provided that no significant obligations remain on our part, substantive acceptance conditions, if any, have been met and the other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	Service revenue from time and materials contracts, and training service agreements, is recognized as services are performed.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	Fixed-price service agreements, and certain time and materials service agreements with capped fee structures, are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P8_S2	We use the percentage-of-completion method of accounting because we believe it is the most accurate method to recognize revenue based on the nature and scope of these engineering service contracts; we believe it is a better measure of periodic income results than other methods and better matches revenue recognized with the costs incurred.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P8_S3	Percentage of completion is measured based primarily on input measures such as hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P8_S4	Significant judgment is required when estimating total hours and progress to completion on these arrangements which determines the amount of revenue we recognize as well as whether a loss is recognized if one is expected to be incurred for the remainder of the project.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	Revisions to hour and cost estimates are incorporated in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	We also enter into arrangements in which a customer purchases a combination of software licenses, engineering services and post-contract customer support and/or maintenance ( PCS ).
1054721_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	As a result, contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting, including how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements if there are multiple elements.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	PCS may include rights to upgrades, when and if available, telephone support, updates and enhancements.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	When vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) of fair value exists for all elements in a multiple element arrangement, revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each of the elements.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	VSOE of fair value is established by the price charged when the same element is sold separately.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P12_S2	Accordingly, the judgments involved in assessing the fair values of various elements of an agreement can impact the recognition of revenue in each period.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P12_S3	Changes in the allocation of the sales price between deliverables might impact the timing of revenue recognition, but would not change the total revenue recognized on the contract.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	When elements such as software and engineering services are contained in a single arrangement, or in related arrangements with the same customer, we allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value, provided that such element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	In the absence of fair value for a delivered element, revenue is first allocated to the fair value of the undelivered elements and then allocated to the residual delivered elements.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P13_S2	In the absence of fair value for an undelivered element, the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting, resulting in a delay of revenue recognition for the delivered elements until the undelivered elements are fulfilled.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	When engineering services and royalties are contained in a single arrangement, we recognize revenue from engineering services as earned in accordance with the criteria above even though the effective rate per hour may be lower than typical because the customer is contractually obligated to pay royalties on their device shipments.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	We recognize royalty revenue, classified as software revenue, when the royalty report from the customer is received or when such royalties are contractually guaranteed and the revenue recognition criteria are met, particularly that collectability is reasonably assured.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P14_S2	There are two items involving revenue recognition that require us to make more difficult and subjective judgments: the determination of VSOE of fair value in multiple element arrangements and the estimation of percentage of completion on fixed-price service contracts.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	We establish VSOE of fair value for TestQuest PCS based on the price when PCS is sold separately.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	VSOE of TestQuest PCS has been well established in the past as these products have been sold on a stand-alone basis for a number of years even prior to our acquisition of TestQuest assets in November 2008.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	We measure our estimate of completion on fixed-price contracts, which in turn determines the amount of revenue we recognize, based primarily on actual hours incurred to date and our estimate of remaining hours necessary to complete the contract.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	The process of estimating the remaining hours on a contract involves detailed estimates of remaining hours by the engineers and project managers involved with the project, factoring in such variables as the remaining tasks, the complexity of the tasks, the contracted quality of the software to be provided, the customer s estimated delivery date, integration of third-party software and quality thereof and other factors.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	Every fixed-price contract requires various approvals within our company, including our Chief Executive Officer if significant.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	This approval process takes into consideration a number of factors including the complexity of engineering.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	Historically, our estimation processes related to fixed-price contracts have been accurate based on the information known at the time of the reporting of our results.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	However, percentage-of-completion estimates require significant judgment.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	As of December 31, 2011, we were delivering engineering services under 23 fixed-price service contracts.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	The percentage of completion calculations on these contracts represents management s best estimates based on the facts and circumstances as of the filing of this report.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P21_S2	If there are changes to the underlying facts and circumstances, revisions to the percentage-of-completion calculations will be recorded in the period the changes are noted.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P21_S3	If we were 10% under in our estimates of completion on every fixed-bid contract active on December 31, 2011, our revenue would be over-stated by $322,000 for 2011.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P21_S4	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We review our accounts receivable regularly for collectability concerns.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P21_S5	In determining the amount of our allowance for doubtful accounts, we make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	Intangible Assets and Goodwill We evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P22_S1	Our intangible assets were generated through our past acquisitions of businesses and particular assets from businesses.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P22_S2	Our intangible assets have consisted of acquired technology, customer relationships, trade names and trademarks, and non-compete agreements.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P22_S3	Factors that could trigger an impairment analysis include significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	If this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired, we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	If this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining useful life, we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P23_S2	Any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P23_S3	During the fourth quarter of 2011, we recognized an impairment charge of $518,000 related to technology acquired from TestQuest in 2008.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P24_S1	Our annual testing date is December 31.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the carrying value.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	estimate of future net sales, gross margins, and operating expenses.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	Certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses and geographies with limited financial history and developing revenue models.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P27_S2	Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	Our stock-based compensation expense for stock options is estimated at the grant date based on the stock award s fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton ( BSM ) option-pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	The BSM model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and option life.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P28_S2	If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	Restricted stock units ( RSUs ) and restricted stock awards ( RSAs ) are measured based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant as determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	To the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimates, stock-based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	Incentive Compensation We make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions regarding the likelihood of attainment, and the level thereof, of bonuses payable under our annual incentive compensation programs.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	We accrue bonuses and recognize the resulting expense when the bonus is judged to be reasonably likely to be earned as of year-end and is estimable.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P31_S2	The amount accrued, and expense recognized, is the estimated portion of the bonus earned on a year-to-date basis less any amounts previously accrued.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P31_S3	These estimates, judgments and assumptions are made quarterly based on available information and take into consideration our year-to-date actual results and expected results for the remainder of the year.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P31_S4	Because we consider estimated future results in assessing the likelihood of attainment, significant judgment is required.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P31_S5	If actual results differ materially from our estimates, the amount of bonus expense recorded in a particular quarter could be significantly over or under estimated.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the countries and other jurisdictions in which we operate.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	This process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P32_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P32_S3	Net operating losses and tax credits, to the extent not already utilized to offset taxable income or income taxes, also give rise to deferred tax assets.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P32_S4	We must then assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income, and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P32_S5	Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P32_S6	Beginning in 2002 and through the third quarter of 2010, we maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P32_S7	In the fourth quarter of 2010, we determined that it was more likely than not that we would generate sufficient future taxable income to realize a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards, and recorded a portion of our deferred tax assets related to such estimated future taxable income.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P32_S8	We estimate the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P32_S9	Our sales may be subject to other taxes, particularly withholding taxes, due to our sales to customers in countries other than the United States.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P32_S10	The tax regulations governing withholding taxes are complex, causing us to have to make assumptions about the appropriate tax treatment.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P32_S11	Further, we make sales in many jurisdictions across the United States, where tax regulations are increasingly becoming more aggressive and complex.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P32_S12	We must therefore continue to analyze our state tax exposure and determine what the appropriate tax treatments are, and make estimates for sales, franchise, income and other state taxes.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	The following table presents certain financial data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	Our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 Acquisition of MPC Data Limited On September 11, 2011 we completed the acquisition of MPC Data Limited ( MPC ), a United Kingdom-based provider of embedded software engineering services.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	The acquisition is part of our overall growth strategy and is designed to capitalize on the growing market for smart, connected devices by expanding both the breadth of services offered and the geographies that we serve.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P35_S2	As the acquisition took place late in the third quarter of 2011, the impact on our results of operations was relatively insignificant for the year in total.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P35_S3	Where applicable, the MPC-related impacts have been noted in the following commentary.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	Our revenue is generated from the sale of software, both our own proprietary software and third-party software that we resell, and the sale of engineering services.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	Total revenue was $96.8 million in both 2011 and 2010.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P36_S2	A $2.2 million decline in sales of Microsoft operating systems in 2011 was offset by increases in our sale of Adobe Flash products, engineering services revenue, and proprietary software revenue.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P36_S3	Our revenue mix has been shifting to customers located outside of North America as we have expanded our sales and development presence in locales outside North America.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P36_S4	Before 2011, our operations outside of North America consisted principally of operations in Taiwan, as well as relatively minor sales and/or support presences in China, India, Japan, Korea, and the United Kingdom.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P36_S5	During 2011 we expanded our sales teams across Asia, our development presence in China and acquired the operations of MPC in the United Kingdom.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	our customers outside of North America increased $6.2 million, or 39%, to $22.1 million in 2011, from $15.9 million in 2010.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	Revenue from our customers outside of North America represented 23% of our total revenue in 2011, compared to 16% in 2010.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P37_S2	This international growth was related primarily to the $5.8 million sales growth of Microsoft Windows Mobile operating systems in the Asia Pacific ( APAC ) region from 2010 to 2011, as well $1.4 million of engineering services revenue derived from MPC, and a $900,000 increase in engineering services revenue in the APAC region as well.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	Software revenue Software revenue consists of sales of third-party software and revenue realized from our own proprietary software products, which include software license sales, royalties from our software products, sales of software development kits, support and maintenance revenue, and royalties from certain engineering service contracts.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P38_S1	Software revenue for 2011 and 2010 was as follows (dollars in thousands):
1054721_12_ITEM7_P38_S2	The vast majority of our third-party software revenue is comprised of sales of Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems and Microsoft Windows Mobile operating systems.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P38_S3	Third-party software sales decreased $1.2 million, or 2%, in 2011 as compared to the prior year.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P38_S4	This decrease was primarily due to a $6.4 million decline in sales of Windows Embedded operating systems, the result of losing one major customer and lower purchasing volumes from several other large customers who worked through excess inventory levels during 2011.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P38_S5	These declines were offset in part by a $4.2 million increase in sales of Windows Mobile operating systems, with much of this increase related to higher purchasing volumes from two major device manufacturers in Korea.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P38_S6	Proprietary software revenue increased $434,000, or 8%, in 2011 compared to 2010 due primarily to higher sales of Qualcomm Mobile Development Kits and increased revenue from our Texas Instruments OMAP software products.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P38_S7	These increases were offset in part by lower TestQuest licensing revenue which was the result of two TestQuest sales which significantly benefited the fourth quarter of 2010 in the amount of $723,000.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	Service revenue Service revenue for 2011 and 2010 was as follows (dollars in thousands): Ford Motor Company ( Ford ) continued to be our largest engineering services customer in 2011, representing 34% of service revenue, compared to 47% of service revenue in 2010.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	in service revenue in 2011 compared to $12.9 million in 2010.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	Since 2008, Ford has engaged us to assist in the development of their next generation infotainment offering called MyFord Touch.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	The MyFord Touch infotainment system is an in-car communications and entertainment system which enables drivers of Ford s car offerings to access a wide range of connected information and entertainment experiences including music and multi-media services, hands-free telephony, Internet-enabled applications, language services, news and navigation.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	Our initial project with Ford was completed in the third quarter of 2010 where we provided them hardware design and implementation, platform level software development, application level software development, quality assurance services and systems integration services for the MyFord Touch.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	Since we completed the initial project, we are now primarily focused on developing and integrating new user applications for the MyFord Touch, enhancing existing applications and customizing the MyFord Touch platform for additional vehicle models.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P42_S2	In 2012, we will continue to work on the MyFord Touch project; however, rather than work directly for Ford, we have been engaged by Microsoft who is the primary provider of services for the MyFord Touch programs.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	Ford contributed $9.7 million in service revenue in 2011, a decline of $3.2 million from 2010.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	The number of engineers working on the MyFord Touch declined since initial project completion in the third quarter of 2010 as we are no longer in the development stage of the MyFord Touch platform.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	Total service revenue increased $818,000, or 3%, in 2011 compared to 2010 due to growth inside and outside of North America from non-Ford customers.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	North American service revenue declined $1.4 million, or 6%, to $23.6 million in 2011, primarily due to the $3.2 million decline related to Ford offset in part by revenue increases related to other customers.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P44_S2	Service revenue in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (the EMEA region) increased by $1.3 million, to $1.7 million in 2011, primarily driven by MPC which contributed $1.4 million to EMEA revenue in 2011 since its acquisition in September 2011.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P44_S3	Service revenue from the APAC region increased $880,000, or 37%, to $3.3 million in 2011 from $2.4 million in 2010, primarily related to a new customer in Japan as well as contributions from China and Korea resulting from our sales expansion in those areas.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	Gross profit and gross margin Cost of revenue related to software revenue consists primarily of the cost of third-party software products payable to third-party vendors.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P45_S1	Cost of revenue related to service revenue consists primarily of salaries and benefits, contractor costs and re-billable expenses, related facilities and depreciation costs, and amortization of certain intangible assets related to acquisitions.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P45_S2	Gross profit on the sale of third-party software products was also positively affected by rebate credits of $746,000 in 2011 and $804,000 in 2010 from Microsoft which we earned through the achievement of defined objectives.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P45_S3	The following table outlines software, services and total gross profit (dollars in thousands):
1054721_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	Software gross profit and gross margin Software gross profit decreased by $652,000, or 5%, in 2011, compared to 2010, while software gross margin decreased by one percentage point to 19%.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	This decline was primarily due to a $518,000 impairment charge related to the acquired technology from TestQuest in 2008 which we recognized in the fourth quarter of 2011 as software cost of revenue.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P46_S2	The intangible assets associated with the acquired technology were deemed to be impaired as this technology is no longer used in any of our product offerings.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2011, we completed development of TQ10, the next generation of our automated testing software.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	TQ10 replaces both of our legacy TestQuest products, Countdown and TQ Pro, in what we will offer to our customers and provide technical support for in the future.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	Although TQ10 is similar in concept to Countdown and TQ Pro, TQ10 was developed on a new code base and architecture.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	As no significant future cash flows are expected to be generated from these legacy technologies, we deemed the intangible assets associated with them to be impaired.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P49_S1	Without the impairment charge, software gross margin would have been consistent with the 20% gross margin in the prior year.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	Service gross profit and gross margin Service gross profit decreased by $418,000, or 6%, in 2011 as compared to 2010, while service gross margin decreased by two percentage points to 22% in 2011, from 24% in 2010.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P50_S1	The decline in service gross margin was primarily the result of higher engineering headcount in the current year largely resulting from our international expansion which resulted in a 10% increase in available hours and increased our cost of sales by $1.2 million compared to 2010.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P50_S2	However, our actual billable hours only increased 2% year-over-year as our utilization fell by eight percentage points in 2011 compared to 2010, most of which resulted from start-up time associated with new personnel and new development centers.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P50_S3	This decline in service margin was partially offset by a 4% increase in our realized rate per hour in 2011 compared to 2010.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	Operating expenses Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, commissions and bonuses for our sales, marketing and administrative personnel and related facilities and depreciation costs, as well as professional services fees (e.g., consulting, legal and audit).
1054721_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $3.8 million, or 30%, to $16.7 million in 2011, from $12.9 million in 2010.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P51_S2	Selling, general and administrative expenses represented 17% of our total revenue in 2011 compared to 13% of revenue in 2010.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P51_S3	The increase was due in part to $934,000 higher stock compensation expense in the current year, as well as a $1.8 million increase in sales and marketing expenses, which was driven by growth in our sales capacity in Asia and Europe, as well as our corporate rebranding in the current year.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P51_S4	General and administrative expenses were also higher in the current year as we added headcount to support our international growth.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P51_S5	The current period was also negatively affected by higher employee fringe rates as health insurance premiums increased during the year, and $193,000 in transaction-related expenses associated with the MPC acquisition.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	Research and development Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for software development and quality assurance personnel, contractor and consultant costs and related facilities and depreciation costs.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	Research and development expenses increased $454,000, or 13%, to $3.8 million in 2011, from $3.4 million in 2010.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P52_S2	This increase was driven primarily by higher costs associated with the development and roll-out of our HCP and TestQuest 10 products in 2011.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P52_S3	Research and development expenses represented 4% of our total revenue in both 2011 and 2010.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	Other income was $422,000 in 2011 compared to other expense of $504,000 in 2010, representing an increase of $926,000 of income.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P53_S1	This increase was primarily due to a $104,000 realized gain on the sale of an auction rate security ( ARS ) investment in 2011, compared to an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $580,000 realized on our ARS investments in 2010.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P53_S2	Additionally, we settled a lawsuit with our former broker dealer of ARS investments for $213,000 in January 2012.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P53_S3	As the events that gave rise to the settlement took place before December 31, 2011, we recognized this settlement as other income in 2011.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	Income tax benefit Income tax benefit decreased by $2.2 million to $166,000 in 2011, from $2.4 million in 2010.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	This decrease was due primarily to a $2.6 million tax benefit recognized in 2010 when we reevaluated the net carrying value of our deferred tax assets.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P54_S2	Our income tax benefit in 2011 was primarily attributable to our reevaluation of the net carrying value of our deferred tax assets generated from our international operations since we now believe some portion will be realized through future income in those regions.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P54_S3	Deferred tax assets and their associated valuation allowances are evaluated quarterly and may change in the future based upon our estimate of the probability of future taxable income.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P54_S4	Reductions in our valuation allowance will have a positive effect on our income tax provision while increases in our valuation allowance will have a negative effect.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2011, we had $19.0 million of cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and restricted cash, compared to $23.1 million at December 31, 2010.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	This $4.1 million decline was primarily the result of our MPC acquisition which utilized $4.8 million of cash, net of cash acquired.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P55_S2	Restricted cash is classified as long term and was $875,000 at both December 31, 2011 and 2010.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P55_S3	This cash is restricted under the terms of our headquarters operating lease which will continue to secure that obligation through its expiration in 2014.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P55_S4	Our working capital was $18.0 million at December 31, 2011, compared to $20.0 million at December 31, 2010.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P55_S5	Cash and cash equivalents were $8.5 million at December 31, 2011, a decrease of $2.3 million from $10.8 million at December 31, 2010.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P55_S6	Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.1 million in 2011, primarily due to $3.1 million of non-cash expenses, a $1.8 million decrease in our accounts receivable, and a $518,000 impairment charge on our intangible assets associated with TestQuest acquired technology.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P55_S7	These cash increases were offset in part by a $2.7 million decline in our third-party software fees payable during the year.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P55_S8	Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.3 million in 2010, primarily attributable to $6.2 million in net income and $2.2 million in non-cash expenses, offset in part by a negative change in various working capital line items.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P55_S9	Net cash used by investing activities was $3.6 million in 2011 primarily due to the acquisition of MPC for $4.8 million in cash, net of cash acquired.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P55_S10	Additionally, we purchased $785,000 of equipment during the year.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P55_S11	These uses of cash for investing activities were offset in part by net maturities of marketable securities during the year.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P55_S12	Net cash used by investing activities was $7.7 million in 2010 primarily due to $19.5 million of purchases of short-term investments offset in part by $8.2 million in proceeds from the maturity of short-term investments and $3.8 million in sales of our ARS.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P55_S13	Financing activities generated cash of $424,000 in 2011 and $383,000 in 2010 as a result of employees exercise of stock options.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P55_S14	We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments will be sufficient to meet our needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	Cash Commitments We have the following future or potential cash commitments:
1054721_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	Under the terms of our corporate headquarters lease signed in February 2004, the landlord has the ability to demand payment for cash payments forgiven in 2004 if we default under the lease.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P57_S1	The amount of the forgiven payments for which the landlord can demand repayment was $640,000 at December 31, 2011, and decreases on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the lease, which expires in 2014.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	Under the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement for MPC, we will pay an earn-out to the sellers of MPC in the fourth quarter of 2012 if certain revenue milestones are met in certain countries of Europe.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P58_S1	We currently estimate this earn-out payment to be $766,000 based on our probability weighted revenue forecasts for that region.
1054721_12_ITEM7_P58_S2	There is no cap on this contingent obligation.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BSQUARE Corporation (the Corporation ) as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity and cash flows for the years then ended.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P0_S1	These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation s management.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P0_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P0_S3	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1054721_12_ITEM8_P0_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P0_S5	The Corporation is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P0_S6	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P0_S7	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P1_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P1_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P1_S2	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of BSQUARE Corporation as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1054721_12_ITEM8_P6_S0	Description of Business and Accounting Policies Description of Business BSQUARE Corporation ( BSQUARE ) was incorporated in Washington State in July 1994.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P7_S0	We provide software solutions and related engineering services to companies that develop smart, connected devices.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P8_S0	A smart, connected device is a dedicated purpose computing device that typically has a display, runs an operating system (e.g., Microsoft Windows CE) and may be connected to a network via a wired or wireless connection.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P8_S1	Examples of smart devices include set-top boxes, home gateways, point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, voting machines, gaming platforms, tablets, handheld data collection devices, personal media players, smart phones and devices targeted at automotive applications.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P8_S2	We focus on smart devices that utilize embedded versions of the Microsoft Windows family of operating systems, specifically Windows Embedded Compact, Windows Embedded Standard and Windows Mobile as well as devices running other popular operating systems such as Android, Linux, and QNX.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P9_S0	We have been providing software solutions to the smart device marketplace since our inception.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P9_S1	Our customers include world class original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ), original design manufacturers ( ODMs ) and enterprises, as well as silicon vendors ( SVs ) and peripheral vendors which purchase our software solutions for purposes of facilitating processor and peripheral sales to the aforementioned customer categories.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P9_S2	In the case of enterprises, our customers include those which develop, market and distribute smart devices on their own behalf as well as those that purchase devices from OEMs or ODMs and require additional device software or testing.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P9_S3	The software solutions we provide are utilized and deployed throughout various phases of our customers device life cycle, including design, development, customization, quality assurance and deployment.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P10_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of BSQUARE Corporation and our wholly owned subsidiaries.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P10_S1	All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P11_S0	Use of Estimates Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P11_S1	Examples include provisions for bad debts and income taxes, estimates of progress on professional engineering service arrangements and bonus accruals.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P11_S2	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P12_S0	Basic income or loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, and excludes any dilutive effects of common stock equivalent shares, such as options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and warrants.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P12_S1	Restricted stock awards ( RSAs ) are considered outstanding and included in the computation of basic income or loss per share when underlying restrictions expire and the awards are no longer forfeitable.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P12_S2	Restricted stock units ( RSUs ), which vest over a period of two to four years, are considered outstanding and included in the computation of basic income or loss per share only when vested.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P12_S3	Diluted income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P12_S4	Common stock equivalent shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is anti-dilutive.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P12_S5	Unvested but outstanding RSUs and RSAs which are forfeitable but outstanding are included in the diluted income per share calculation as well.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P13_S0	The following table presents a reconciliation of the number of shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted income (loss) per share (in thousands): Had we not been in a net loss position, our weighted average shares used to calculate diluted income (loss) per share would have been 11,419,000, representing a dilutive effect of common stock equivalents of 825,000 shares.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P14_S0	We invest our excess cash primarily in highly liquid debt instruments of U.S. government agencies and municipalities, debt instruments issued by foreign government, corporate commercial paper, money market funds, and corporate debt securities.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P14_S1	We classify all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months as short-term investments.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P14_S2	Short-term investments consist entirely of marketable securities which are all classified as available-for-sale securities and are recorded at their estimated fair value.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P14_S3	We determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P14_S4	We may or may not hold securities with stated maturities greater than 12 months until maturity.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P14_S5	As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify securities with maturities beyond 12 months as short-term investments in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P14_S6	We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of stockholders equity, except for unrealized losses determined to be other than temporary which are recorded in other expense.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P15_S0	Restricted Cash Our restricted cash represents time deposits held at a financial institution as security for an outstanding letter of credit expiring in 2014 related to our corporate headquarters lease obligation.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P16_S0	Long-term Investments Our long-term investments as of December 31, 2010 consisted of auction rate securities ( ARS ), which were recorded at their estimated fair value.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P17_S0	Financial Instruments and Concentrations of Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts receivable.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P17_S1	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We record accounts receivable at the invoiced amount net of an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P17_S2	We review customers which are past due to identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P17_S3	In determining the amount of the allowance, we make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P18_S0	Equipment, Furniture and Leasehold Improvements We account for equipment, furniture and leasehold improvements at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P19_S0	estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three years.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P20_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful lives, ranging from 2 to 10 years.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P20_S1	Maintenance and repairs costs are expensed as incurred.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P21_S0	When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, gains or losses are included in the statement of operations.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P22_S0	When facts and circumstances indicate that the value of long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying value of the asset to projected undiscounted future cash flows.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P22_S1	Upon indication that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss as a charge against current operations based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P23_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets were recorded as a result of asset and business acquisitions and are stated at estimated fair value at the time of acquisition less accumulated amortization.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P24_S0	We amortize our acquired intangible assets using the straight-line method using lives ranging from one to 10 years.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P25_S0	We review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P25_S1	We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P26_S0	If intangible assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P26_S1	Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P26_S2	Our annual testing date is December 31.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P27_S0	We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P27_S1	If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P28_S0	We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P28_S1	Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales, gross margins, and operating expenses.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P28_S2	Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P29_S0	We record all fees payable and accrued liabilities related to the sale of third-party software, such as Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, as third-party software fees payable.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P30_S0	Software Development Costs No software development costs have been capitalized as the cost has been immaterial.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P30_S1	Research and Development Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P30_S2	Advertising Costs All costs of advertising, including cooperative marketing arrangements, are expensed as incurred.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P30_S3	Advertising expense was $588,000 in 2011 and $93,000 in 2010.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P30_S4	The estimated fair value of stock based awards is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the award, net of estimated forfeitures.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P31_S0	historical experience and expected future activity.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P32_S0	The fair value of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P32_S1	The fair value of stock option awards are estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of each vesting tranche as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton ( BSM ) option-pricing model.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P32_S2	The BSM model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and option life.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P32_S3	If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P33_S0	Incentive Compensation We make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions regarding the likelihood of our attainment, and the level thereof, of bonuses payable under our annual incentive compensation programs.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P33_S1	We accrue bonuses and recognize the resulting expense when the bonus is judged to be reasonably likely to be earned as of year-end and is estimable.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P33_S2	The amount accrued, and expense recognized, is the estimated portion of the bonus earned on a year-to-date basis less any amounts previously accrued.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P33_S3	These estimates, judgments and assumptions are made quarterly based on available information and take into consideration our year-to-date actual results and expected results for the remainder of the year.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P33_S4	Because our attainment estimate factors estimated future results, significant judgment is required.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P33_S5	If actual results differ materially from our estimates, the amount of bonus expense recorded in a particular quarter could be significantly over or under estimated.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P34_S0	Comprehensive Income (Loss) Comprehensive income (loss) refers to net income (loss) and other revenue, expenses, gains and losses that, under generally accepted accounting principles, are recorded as an element of shareholders equity but are excluded from the calculation of net income (loss).
1054721_12_ITEM8_P34_S1	The changes in the components of other comprehensive income (loss) are as follows (in thousands):
1054721_12_ITEM8_P34_S2	The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss are as follows (in thousands):
1054721_12_ITEM8_P35_S0	Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P35_S1	Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P36_S0	We compute income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred income taxes are provided for on the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P36_S1	Our deferred tax assets are measured using currently enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P36_S2	A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P37_S0	The functional currency of foreign subsidiaries is the local currency.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P37_S1	Accordingly, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P37_S2	Resulting translation adjustments are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, a separate component of shareholders equity.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P38_S0	The net gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are recorded in the period incurred and were not significant for any of the periods presented.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P39_S0	We recognize revenue from software and engineering service sales when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the selling price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P39_S1	Contracts and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P39_S2	Shipping documents and time records are generally used to verify delivery.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P39_S3	We assess whether the selling price is fixed or determinable based on the contract and/or customer purchase order and payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P39_S4	We assess collectability based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer s payment history.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P39_S5	Periodically, we will begin work on engineering service engagements prior to having a signed contract and, in some cases, the contract is signed in a quarter after which service delivery costs are incurred.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P39_S6	We do not defer costs associated with these uncontracted engagements.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P39_S7	We recognize software revenue upon shipment provided that no significant obligations remain on our part, substantive acceptance conditions, if any, have been met and the other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P40_S0	Service revenue from time and materials contracts, and training service agreements, is recognized as services are performed.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P40_S1	Fixed-price service agreements, and certain time and materials service agreements with capped fee structures, are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P40_S2	We use the percentage-of-completion method of accounting because it is the most accurate method to recognize revenue based on the nature and scope of these engineering service contracts; it is a better measure of periodic income results than other methods and it better matches revenue recognized with the costs incurred.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P40_S3	Percentage of completion is measured based primarily on input measures such as hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P40_S4	Significant judgment is required when estimating total hours and progress to completion on these arrangements which determines the amount of revenue we recognize as well as whether a loss is recognized if one is expected to be incurred for the remainder of the project.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P41_S0	Revisions to hour and cost estimates are incorporated in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P42_S0	We also enter into arrangements in which a customer purchases a combination of software licenses, engineering services and post-contract customer support and/or maintenance ( PCS ).
1054721_12_ITEM8_P42_S1	As a result, contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting, including how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements if there are multiple elements.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P43_S0	PCS may include rights to upgrades, when and if available, telephone support, updates and enhancements.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P44_S0	When vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) of fair value exists for all elements in a multiple element arrangement, revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each of the elements.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P44_S1	VSOE of fair value is established by the price charged when the same element is sold separately.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P44_S2	Accordingly, the judgments involved in assessing the fair values of various elements of an agreement can impact the recognition of revenue in each period.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P44_S3	Changes in the allocation of the sales price between deliverables might impact the timing of revenue recognition, but would not change the total revenue recognized on the contract.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P45_S0	When elements such as software and engineering services are contained in a single arrangement, or in related arrangements with the same customer, we allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value, provided that such element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P45_S1	In the absence of fair value for a delivered element, revenue is first allocated to the fair value of the undelivered elements and then allocated to the residual delivered elements.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P46_S0	value for an undelivered element, the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting, resulting in a delay of revenue recognition for the delivered elements until the undelivered elements are fulfilled.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P47_S0	When engineering services and royalties are contained in a single arrangement, we recognize revenue from engineering services as earned in accordance with the criteria above even though the effective rate per hour may be lower than typical because the customer is contractually obligated to pay royalties on their device shipments.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P47_S1	We recognize royalty revenue, classified as software revenue, when the royalty report from the customer is received or when such royalties are contractually guaranteed and the revenue recognition criteria are met, particularly that collectability is reasonably assured.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P48_S0	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) to address diversity in practice in interpreting the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P48_S1	The ASU specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the current year business combination(s) had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P48_S2	We prospectively adopted this ASU effective Q1 2011, with no impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P49_S0	In 2011, the FASB issued two ASUs which amend guidance for the presentation of comprehensive income.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P49_S1	The amended guidance requires an entity to present components of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement, referred to as the statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate, but consecutive statements.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P49_S2	The current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of stockholders equity will be eliminated.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P49_S3	Although the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income, there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under existing guidance.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P49_S4	These ASUs are effective for us in Q1 2012 and retrospective application will be required.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P49_S5	These ASUs will change our financial statement presentation of comprehensive income but will not impact our net income, financial position, or cash flows.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P50_S0	In 2011, the FASB issued an ASU which allows an entity the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair value of a reporting unit.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P50_S1	The ASU also expands upon the examples of events and circumstances that an entity should consider between annual impairment tests in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P50_S2	The ASU is effective for us in Q1 2012, with early adoption permitted.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P50_S3	We do not expect adoption to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P51_S0	Cash and Investments Cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, long-term investments and restricted cash consist of the following (in thousands): Gross unrealized gains and losses on our cash equivalents, and short-term investments were not material as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P52_S0	Fair Value Measurements We measure our cash equivalents, marketable securities, auction rate security ( ARS ), and the earn-out liability associated with our acquisition of MPC Data Limited ( MPC ) (see note 4) at fair value.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P53_S0	Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P53_S1	As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P53_S2	A three-tier fair value hierarchy is established as a basis for considering such assumptions and for inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:
1054721_12_ITEM8_P54_S0	Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P55_S0	Level 2: Directly or indirectly observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs used in models or other valuation methodologies.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P56_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P56_S1	The inputs require significant management judgment or estimation.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P57_S0	We classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities within Level 1 or Level 2.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P57_S1	This is because we value our cash equivalents and marketable securities using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P57_S2	We classify our investment in ARS within Level 3 because it is valued using valuation techniques based on multiple inputs.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P57_S3	We classify our earn-out liability associated with MPC within Level 3 as it is valued using valuation techniques using inputs such as management s estimation of future sales.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P57_S4	Some of the inputs to these models are unobservable in the market and are significant.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P58_S0	Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in thousands):
1054721_12_ITEM8_P59_S0	An impairment charge of $518,000 was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2011 for intangible assets measured using level 3 inputs and recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P59_S1	These intangible assets were associated with acquired technology (see Note 6).
1054721_12_ITEM8_P60_S0	4. Acquisition On September 11, 2011, we completed the acquisition of MPC Data Limited ( MPC ), a United Kingdom based provider of embedded software engineering services.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P61_S0	We acquired all outstanding shares of MPC preferred and common stock in exchange for total consideration of $7.1 million, which included an earn-out with an estimated fair value of $810,000 on the acquisition date.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P61_S1	The fair value of the earn-out will be re-measured to estimated fair value each reporting period based on specific revenue earned in designated regions of Europe through September 30, 2012 and is not capped.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P61_S2	The estimated fair value of the earn-out was $766,000 as of December 31, 2011.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P61_S3	If our estimate of applicable revenue varies from actuals by 10%, the impact on the earn-out would be $90,000.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P61_S4	We also acquired $1.5 million in cash and cash equivalents as part of the acquisition, for a net estimated total cash price of $5.5 million.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P61_S5	In connection with the business combination, we incurred merger-related costs, including legal, consulting, accounting and other costs, of $193,000 during 2011 which we recognized as expense.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P62_S0	The business combination was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date measured at their fair values, including intangible assets acquired consisting of trade names and trademarks, non-compete agreements, and customer relationships.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P62_S1	The acquisition of MPC was structured as a stock purchase and therefore the values assigned to the intangible assets and goodwill are not deductible for tax purposes.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P62_S2	Deferred tax liabilities of $233,000 were recognized as part of the transaction.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P62_S3	The excess of the acquisition consideration, including the estimated fair value of the earn-out, over the fair value of net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P62_S4	Our allocation of the acquisition consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is as follows (in thousands): Of the intangible assets acquired, customer relationships have a weighted-average useful life of 10 years, non-compete agreements have a weighted-average useful life of 2 years, and trade names and trademarks have a weighted-average useful life of 1 year.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P62_S5	We will assess the fair value of the earn-out associated with the acquisition each period using level 3 inputs represented by management s estimation of future applicable engineering service revenue attributable to MPC through September 30, 2012.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P62_S6	Any changes to the estimated fair value of the earn-out will be realized as other income (expense), net in the period which the changes occurred.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P62_S7	The unaudited pro forma results of operations are being furnished solely for informational purposes and are not intended to represent or be indicative of the consolidated results of operations that we would have reported had the MPC acquisition been completed as of the dates and for the periods presented, nor are they necessarily indicative of future results.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P63_S0	representing pro forma amortization of intangible assets.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P63_S1	Included in these pro forma results are revenue of $1.4 million and net income of $96,000 related to MPC since the date of acquisition.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P63_S2	The pro forma results were adjusted to assume the $193,000 of acquisition expenses directly related to MPC was incurred on January 1, 2010.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P63_S3	These pro forma results of operations do not give effect to any cost savings, revenue synergies, integration or restructuring costs which may result from the MPC operations.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P63_S4	The unaudited pro forma combined condensed results of operations are presented below as if the MPC acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2010 (amounts in 000 s, except per share amounts):
1054721_12_ITEM8_P64_S0	Equipment, Furniture and Leasehold Improvements Equipment, furniture, and leasehold improvements consist of the following (in thousands):
1054721_12_ITEM8_P65_S0	Depreciation and amortization expense of equipment, furniture and leasehold improvements was $502,000 in 2011 and $399,000 in 2010.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P66_S0	The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2011 were as follows (in thousands): Intangible assets relate to developed technology, trade names and trademarks, customer relationships, and non-compete agreements that we acquired from TestQuest in November 2008 and through the acquisition of MPC in September 2011.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P67_S0	In the fourth quarter of 2011, we recognized a $518,000 impairment charge as software cost of revenue related to the acquired technology from TestQuest in 2008.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P67_S1	The intangible asset associated with the acquired technology was deemed to be impaired as this technology is no longer used in any of our product offerings.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P68_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2011, we completed development of TQ10, the next generation of our automated testing software.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P68_S1	TQ10 will replace both legacy TestQuest products, Countdown and TQ Pro, in what we will offer to our customers and provide technical support for in the future.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P69_S0	Although TQ10 is similar in concept to Countdown and TQ Pro, TQ10 was developed on a new code base and architecture.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P69_S1	As no significant future cash flows are expected to be generated from these legacy technologies, we deemed the intangible asset associated with Countdown to be impaired and recognized a $518,000 impairment charge accordingly as software cost of revenue.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P69_S2	Information regarding our acquisition-related intangible assets is as follows (in thousands):
1054721_12_ITEM8_P70_S0	Amortization expense was $417,000 and $463,000 for 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P70_S1	As of December 31, 2011, expected amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets for each of the next five years and thereafter was as follows (in thousands):
1054721_12_ITEM8_P71_S0	The components of other income (expense), net are as follows (in thousands):
1054721_12_ITEM8_P72_S0	Income Taxes Income (loss) before income taxes consists of the following (in thousands):
1054721_12_ITEM8_P73_S0	Income tax benefit consists of the following (in thousands):
1054721_12_ITEM8_P74_S0	The components of net deferred tax assets consist of the following (in thousands):
1054721_12_ITEM8_P75_S0	Our net deferred tax assets are recorded as follows (in thousands):
1054721_12_ITEM8_P76_S0	The provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the applicable U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to pre-tax income, as a result of the following: Beginning in 2002 and through the third quarter of 2010, we maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as we were unable to determine that it was more likely than not that we would generate sufficient future taxable income for them to be realized.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P76_S1	In the fourth quarter of 2010, we determined that it was more likely than not that we would generate sufficient future taxable income to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets, and reduced our valuation allowance accordingly.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P76_S2	Upon review in 2011, it was determined that no additional valuation allowance release was necessary at this time.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P76_S3	At December 31, 2011, we had approximately $59.2 million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, and $2.6 million of tax credit carryforwards, which begin to expire in 2022.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P76_S4	Utilization of these carryforward may be subject to an annual limitation due to Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code which restricts the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use its carryforwards.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P77_S0	Under the applicable tax rules, an ownership change occurs if greater than five percent shareholders of an issuer s outstanding common stock, collectively, increase their ownership percentage by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P77_S1	We have performed analyses of possible ownership changes in the past, which included consideration of a third-party study, and do not believe that an ownership change of more than 50 percentage points has occurred.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P77_S2	We are no longer subject to U.S. federal tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2007, and with a few immaterial exceptions, we are also no longer subject to U.S. state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2007.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P78_S0	Our principal commitments consist of obligations outstanding under operating leases, which expire through 2018.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P78_S1	We have lease commitments for office space in Bellevue, Washington; Boston, Massachusetts; San Diego, California; Longmont, Colorado; Chanhassen, Minnesota; Dallas, Texas; Taipei, Taiwan; Beijing, China; Trowbridge, United Kingdom; Seoul, Korea; and Nishi-Shinjuku, Japan.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P78_S2	We also lease office space in Akron, Ohio on a month-to-month basis.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P78_S3	Under the terms of our corporate headquarters lease signed in February 2004, if we default under the lease, the landlord has the ability to demand payment for cash payments forgiven in 2004.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P78_S4	The amount of the forgiven payments for which the landlord can demand repayment was $640,000 at December 31, 2011.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P79_S0	Rent expense was $1.6 million in 2011 and $1.5 million in 2010.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P79_S1	As of December 31, 2011, we had $875,000 pledged as collateral for a bank letter of credit under the terms of our headquarters facility lease.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P79_S2	The pledged cash supporting the outstanding letter of credit is recorded as restricted cash.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P79_S3	Operating lease commitments at December 31, 2011 are as follows (in thousands):
1054721_12_ITEM8_P80_S0	We have a stock plan (the Stock Plan ) and an inducement stock plan for newly hired employees (the Inducement Plan ) (collectively the Plans ).
1054721_12_ITEM8_P80_S1	Under the Plans, stock options may be granted with a fixed exercise price that is equivalent to fair market value on the date of grant.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P80_S2	These options have a term of up to 10 years and vest over a predetermined period, generally four years.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P80_S3	Incentive stock options granted under the Stock Plan may only be granted to our employees.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P80_S4	The Plans also allow for awards of non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSAs and unrestricted stock awards, and RSUs.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P81_S0	The Stock Plan allows for an automatic annual increase in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Stock Plan.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P81_S1	Such automatic annual increase is in an amount equal to the lesser of: (i) four percent of our outstanding shares at the end of the previous fiscal year, (ii) an amount determined by our Board of Directors, or (iii) 375,000 shares.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P82_S0	The Inducement Plan was established in connection with the MPC acquisition.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P82_S1	Initially, 250,000 shares were allocated for award under the Inducement Plan.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P82_S2	The number of shares available for award may be modified by our Board of Directors, subject to SEC and NASDAQ limitations.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P82_S3	There were no grants under the Inducement Plan during 2011.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P83_S0	The estimated fair value of stock based awards is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the award, net of estimated forfeitures.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P84_S0	We estimate forfeitures of stock based awards based on historical experience and expected future activity.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P85_S0	The fair value of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P85_S1	The fair value of stock option awards are estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of each vesting tranche as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton ( BSM ) option-pricing model.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P85_S2	The BSM model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and option life.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P85_S3	If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P86_S0	The fair values of our equity awards, primarily stock option grants, were estimated with the following weighted average assumptions:
1054721_12_ITEM8_P87_S0	The following table summarizes stock option activity under the Stock Plan for 2010 and 2011:
1054721_12_ITEM8_P88_S0	At December 31, 2011, total compensation cost related to stock options granted to employees under the Plan but not yet recognized was $907,000, net of estimated forfeitures.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P88_S1	This cost will be amortized on the straight-line method over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.5 years.
1054721_12_ITEM8_P89_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the quoted price of our common stock for the number of options that were in-the-money at year end.

1054721_13_ITEM1_P6_S1	Our customers include world class original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ), original design manufacturers ( ODMs ) and enterprises, as well as silicon vendors ( SVs ) and peripheral vendors which purchase our software solutions for purposes of facilitating processor and peripheral sales to the aforementioned customer categories.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P6_S2	In the case of enterprises, our customers include those which develop, market and distribute smart devices on their own behalf as well as those that purchase devices from OEMs or ODMs and require additional device software or testing.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P6_S3	The software solutions we provide are utilized and deployed throughout various phases of our customers device life cycle, including design, development, customization, quality assurance and deployment.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	We were incorporated in the State of Washington in July 1994.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P7_S1	Our principal office is located at 110 110th Avenue NE, Suite 200, Bellevue, Washington 98004, and our telephone number is (425) 519-5900.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	The increasing opportunity for connectivity and exchange of data coupled with the rise of cloud storage and cloud computing infrastructure is driving new applications for smart, connected systems of all kinds.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	The smart, connected systems industry is characterized by a wide variety of software and hardware configurations and end-user applications, often designed to address a specific vertical market.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P9_S1	To accommodate these diverse characteristics in a cost-effective manner, OEMs and ODMs require operating systems that can support a diverse set of hardware requirements and connect to a wide variety of networks, systems, peripherals, content and applications.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P9_S2	The smart, connected systems marketplace is being influenced by the following factors:
1054721_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	Expectations for device functionality continue to grow.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	Security is an increasingly important concern as devices are now often able to access networks and store sensitive information locally such as email, spreadsheets and other documents.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	Increase in device complexity is being driven by rising user expectations of functionality, complex device interactions with wireless networks and updated versions of embedded operating systems and silicon processors, all of which are driving OEMs and ODMs to continually refresh and update their device designs.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P12_S1	Our customers include world class OEMs and ODMs, enterprises, mobile network operators, SVs and peripheral vendors which are developing smart devices or assisting others in doing so.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P12_S2	Representative customer engagements in 2012 included the following:
1054721_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	We continued in the development of a next generation infotainment offering called MyFord Touch which is a product of Ford Motor Company ( Ford ).
1054721_13_ITEM1_P13_S1	The MyFord Touch infotainment system is an in-car communications and entertainment system which enables drivers of Ford s car offerings to access a wide range of connected information and entertainment experiences including music and multi-media services, hands-free telephony, Internet-enabled applications, language services, news and navigation.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P13_S2	Our initial project with Ford on this platform was completed in the third quarter of 2010 where we provided them hardware design and implementation, platform level software development, application level software development, quality assurance services and systems integration services for the MyFord Touch.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P13_S3	Since we completed the initial project, we are now primarily focused on developing and integrating new user applications for the MyFord Touch, enhancing existing applications and customizing the MyFord Touch platform for additional vehicle models.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P13_S4	In 2012, we continued to work on the MyFord Touch project; however, rather than work directly for Ford, we were engaged by Microsoft who is the primary provider of services for the MyFord Touch programs.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	The Coca-Cola Company ( Coca-Cola ) continues to engage us to assist in the development of Freestyle Coke s next generation drink dispensing machine.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	The software we deliver to our customers as part of our smart device software solutions takes three forms.

1054721_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	Service revenue for the last two fiscal years was as follows (in thousands):
1054721_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	Service revenue related to the MyFord Touch program was $6.4 million, or 25% of service revenue, in 2012 and $9.7 million, or 34% of service revenue, in 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	Our strategy is to continue to enhance our position as a leading provider of device software solutions and related services, ultimately becoming the go-to solutions provider for our customers and potential customers around the globe.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P29_S1	To advance this strategy, we intend to continue to focus on the following areas:
1054721_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	We are expanding our geographies served around the globe.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P30_S1	Our acquisition of MPC Data Limited ( MPC ) in 2011 established our European engineering services delivery center as well as a platform for European growth of our other offerings.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P30_S2	We also opened our first development center in China, located in Beijing, as well as expanded our Taiwan development center during 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	We are working to expand the number of engineering service practice areas that we offer to our customers.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	We will continue to seek businesses that we can partner with or acquire that will further our strategic goals as we did with the MPC acquisition.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P32_S1	Relationship with Microsoft and Impact on our Smart Device Solutions Business We have a long-standing relationship with Microsoft and this relationship is critical to the continuing success of our business.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P32_S2	Our credentials as a Microsoft partner include:
1054721_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	We have been one of Microsoft s largest distributors of Windows Embedded operating systems (e.g. Windows Embedded Compact and Windows Embedded Standard) for over 13 years.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	We have been engaged by Microsoft on various service engagements.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	We work closely with Microsoft executives, developers, product managers and sales personnel.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P35_S1	We leverage these relationships in a variety of ways, including:
1054721_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	We receive rebates from Microsoft based upon the achievement of predefined sales objectives.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P36_S1	See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for more information regarding our relationship with Microsoft.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	Customers Customers of our software solutions and engineering services include leading OEMs, ODMs, SVs, peripheral vendors, and other enterprises seeking to leverage the software we provide them, be it our own proprietary software, third-party software or custom software developed via our engineering services, to develop high-quality, full-featured smart devices that meet the requirements of numerous end-markets.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P37_S1	Representative customers include Ford, Coca-Cola, Qualcomm Inc., Tyco Electronics Ltd., Honeywell International, Inc., Canon, Inc., Microsoft, Motorola Solutions, and Research In Motion Ltd.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	The MyFord Touch program, under which we provided services to Ford in 2011 and Microsoft in 2012, accounted for $6.4 million, or 6% of total revenue, in 2012, and $9.7 million, or 10% of total revenue, in 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P38_S1	No other customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue in 2011 and there were no customers that accounted for more than 10% of total revenue in 2012.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P39_S0	Revenue generated from the MyFord Touch program has been declining primarily due to completion of the main MyFord Touch project in August 2011 and a resulting decline in the number of our resources working on the program.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P40_S0	Sales and Marketing We market our software solutions and engineering services predominantly utilizing a direct sales model.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P40_S1	We have sales personnel throughout the United States and in various countries in Asia and Europe.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P41_S0	Historically, we have not made significant use of resellers, channel partners, representative agents or other indirect channels.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P41_S1	Key elements of our sales and marketing strategy include direct marketing, trade shows, event marketing, public relations, customer and strategic alliance partner co-marketing programs and a comprehensive website.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P41_S2	We rely significantly on lead referral and other marketing support programs from strategic partners.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P42_S0	Research and Development Our research and development personnel are responsible for the design, development and release of our proprietary software products.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P42_S1	Members of our research and development staff work closely with our sales and marketing departments, as well as with our customers and potential customers, to better understand market needs and requirements.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P42_S2	We perform our research and development primarily utilizing engineering staff located in and outside the United States.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P42_S3	Research and development expense was $3.6 million and $3.8 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P43_S0	Competition The market for device software and services is extremely competitive.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P43_S1	We face competition from the following:
1054721_13_ITEM1_P44_S0	Mobile and embedded test automation providers including Perfecto Mobile, mVerify, JAMO Solutions, SmartBear Software (AutomatedQA), TestPlant (eggPlant) and Keynote.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P45_S0	Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating system distributors such as Arrow Electronics, Inc., Avnet, Inc., Synnex Corporation in Taiwan; and MDS Technology Co., Ltd in Korea.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P46_S0	Some of our competitors focus on only one aspect of our business or offer complementary products which can be integrated with our products.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P46_S1	As we develop and bring to market new software products and service offerings, particularly offerings focused on specific industries and/or focused on devices utilizing non-Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems, we may begin competing with companies with which we have not previously competed.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P46_S2	Further, as we expand the geographic markets into which we sell our software solutions and related services, we may expect to increasingly compete with companies with which we have not previously competed.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P46_S3	It is also possible that new competitors will enter the market or that our competitors will form alliances, including alliances with Microsoft, that may enable them to rapidly increase their market share.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P46_S4	Microsoft has not agreed to any exclusive arrangement with us, nor has it agreed not to compete with us.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P46_S5	Microsoft may decide to bring more of the core embedded development services and expertise that we provide in-house, possibly resulting in reduced software and service revenue opportunities for us.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P47_S0	The barrier to entering the market as a provider of Microsoft-based smart device software and services is low.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P47_S1	In addition, Microsoft has created marketing programs to encourage systems integrators to work on Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating system software and services.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P47_S2	These systems integrators are given substantially the same access by Microsoft to the Microsoft technology as we are.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P47_S3	New competitors may have lower overhead than we do and may be able to undercut our pricing.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P47_S4	We expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter the connected device market, and as new products and technologies are introduced.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P48_S0	Our international operations outside of North America consisted principally of operations in Taipei Taiwan, Beijing China and Trowbridge England.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P48_S1	Our presence in Trowbridge England resulted from the acquisition of MPC Data Limited in September 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P48_S2	We have minor sales and sales support presences in other countries in Asia and Europe as well.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P48_S3	Because our OEM Distribution Agreement with Microsoft for the sale of Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems (e.g. Windows Embedded Compact) has been, until relatively recently, restricted to North America, including Mexico, the majority of our revenue continues to be generated from North America.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P49_S0	The increase in non-North American revenue in 2012 was attributable to higher service revenue in Europe driven by the September 2011 acquisition of MPC as well as an increase in service revenue and third party software sales in Asia.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P49_S1	See Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for more information regarding our international operations.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P49_S2	The following highlights the total number of employees by area:
1054721_13_ITEM1_P50_S0	As of December 31, 2012, we were also utilizing the services of 19 contractors, primarily for engineering services, compared to 46 at December 31, 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P50_S1	Of the total headcount of 260 at December 31, 2012, 145 were located in North America, 47 were located in Taiwan, 42 were located in the United Kingdom and 19 were located in China with the remainder located in other countries in Asia and Europe.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P51_S0	As conditions necessitate, engineering service employees perform research and development activities and vice versa.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P52_S0	We effected three headcount reductions during 2012 necessitated by business conditions.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P52_S1	The first occurred in the first quarter and primarily affected sales and engineering services.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P52_S2	The second occurred in the third quarter and affected research and product development and the last occurred in the fourth quarter and primarily affected sales and engineering services.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P52_S3	The fourth quarter headcount reduction was the largest of the three, impacting 20 full-time personnel in total.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P53_S0	In general, we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and through contractual arrangements.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P53_S1	However, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be effective to prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, or to prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to, or competitive with, those developed by us.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P53_S2	Additionally, because a significant portion of our revenue relates to the sale of third-party software products, we also rely on our partners, particularly Microsoft, to appropriately protect their own intellectual property.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P53_S3	We currently have eight issued patents and one pending patent in the United States, and we have a number of registered trademarks in various jurisdictions.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P53_S4	We will continue to pursue appropriate protections for our intellectual property.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P53_S5	See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for more information regarding our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P54_S0	We are a reporting company and file annual, quarterly and current reports and other information with the SEC.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P55_S0	100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P55_S1	You also may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P55_S2	The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information we file electronically with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov .
1054721_13_ITEM1_P55_S3	Our Internet website is located at www.bsquare.com.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P55_S4	We make available, free of charge, through the investor relations section of our website, under SEC Filings, all our filings, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.
1054721_13_ITEM1_P55_S5	The following table sets forth certain information with respect to our directors and executive officers as of January 31, 2013:
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and the trading price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Microsoft-Related Risk Factors Due to the fact that we have historically provided software and services to customers building devices utilizing Microsoft s Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, as well as the fact that a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, Microsoft has a significant direct and indirect influence on our business.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P1_S3	The following Microsoft-related risk factors may negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P1_S4	If we do not maintain our OEM Distribution Agreements with Microsoft or if Microsoft de-emphasizes or divests itself from these areas of its business, our revenue would decrease and our business would be adversely affected.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	the United States, Canada, the Caribbean (excluding Cuba), Mexico, the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	These ODAs are effective through June 30, 2013.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	We have also entered into other ODAs with Microsoft pursuant to which we are licensed to sell Microsoft Windows Mobile operating systems to customers in North America, South America, Central America, Japan, Taiwan, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P2_S3	The ODAs to sell Windows Mobile operating systems are effective through June 2014 with the exception of EMEA which expired on December 31, 2012 but which we expect to be renewed shortly.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P2_S4	We generated $67.0 million and $58.4 million of revenue in 2012 and 2011, respectively, through our sales of Microsoft operating systems and expect this revenue stream to continue in 2013 although our rights to distribute Windows Mobile operating systems in Korea ended on October 31, 2012.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P2_S5	We sold $4.5 million of Windows Mobile operating systems in Korea in 2012 and $4.6 million in 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	If any of the ODAs are terminated by Microsoft (which Microsoft can do unilaterally) or not renewed, or if Microsoft decides to no longer invest in or to divest itself from these areas of its business, our software revenue and resulting gross profit could decrease significantly and our operating results would be negatively impacted.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Future renewals, if any, could be on less favorable terms, which could also negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Microsoft can change pricing under the ODAs at any time and unless we are able to either pass through price increases to our customers or sign our customers to 12-month purchasing commitments, which lowers the price we pay to Microsoft, our revenue, gross profit and operating results would be negatively impacted.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Further, Microsoft currently offers a rebate program in conjunction with our ODA activities in which we earn money for achieving certain predefined objectives.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P3_S4	If Microsoft were to eliminate or negatively modify the rebate program, our gross profit and operating results would be negatively impacted.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P3_S5	We earned rebate credits from Microsoft of $888,000 and $746,000 in 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P3_S6	Microsoft has audited our records under the ODAs in the past and will likely audit our records again in the future and any negative audit results could result in additional charges and/or the termination of the ODAs.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	There are provisions in the ODAs that require us to maintain certain internal records and processes for auditing and other reasons.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Non-compliance with these and other requirements could result in the termination of the ODAs.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Microsoft has concluded audits of our records pertaining to the ODA in 2009 and 2006, neither of which had material findings.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	It is possible that future audits could result in charges due to any material findings that are found.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If we are invoiced by Microsoft for a pricing adjustments under OVRP arrangements and we are unable to pass through the charge to our customers, our operating results and cash flow would be negatively impacted.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	In conjunction with our activities under the ODAs with Microsoft, we enter into OEM Volume Royalty Program ( OVRP ) commitments with Microsoft.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Under these OVRPs, we are provided with volume pricing on a customer-by-customer basis assuming certain minimum unit volumes are met.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	The OVRP terms are 12 months.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P6_S3	In the event we don t meet the committed minimum unit volumes, we are obligated to pay the difference between the committed per-unit volume rate and the actual per-unit rate we achieved based upon actual units purchased.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P6_S4	The OVRP arrangements do not equate to a minimum purchase commitment but rather the arrangements are a volume pricing arrangement based upon actual volume purchased.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P6_S5	In substantially all instances, we have reciprocal agreements with our customers such that we will receive per-unit price adjustments, similar to the amounts we would subsequently owe to Microsoft if such OVRP volumes are not met.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P6_S6	While our history with OVRP arrangements has shown that very few result in a price adjustment and, for those that have, we have been able to pass through the price adjustment to our customer, in the event the customer is unwilling or unable to pay us, our operating results and cash flow would be negatively impacted.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	If we do not maintain our favorable relationship with Microsoft, we will have difficulty marketing and selling our software and services and may not receive developer releases of Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	As a result, our revenue and operating results could suffer.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P7_S2	We maintain a strategic marketing relationship with Microsoft.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P7_S3	If our relationship with Microsoft deteriorates for any reason, including an increased focus by us on customers building devices utilizing non-Microsoft operating systems, our efforts to market and sell our software and services to OEMs and others could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Microsoft has significant influence over the development plans and buying decisions of OEMs and others utilizing the various Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems for smart devices and these targeted platforms are a significant focus for us.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Microsoft provides customer referrals to us.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P7_S6	Moreover, Microsoft controls the marketing campaigns related to its operating systems.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P7_S7	Microsoft s marketing activities, including trade shows, direct mail campaigns and print advertising, are important to the continued promotion and market acceptance of Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems and, consequently, to our sale of Windows-based software and services.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P7_S8	We must maintain a favorable relationship with Microsoft to continue to participate in joint marketing activities with them, which includes participating in partner pavilions at trade shows, listing our services on Microsoft s website, and receiving customer referrals.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P7_S9	In the event that we are unable to continue our joint marketing efforts with Microsoft, or fail to receive referrals from them, we would be required to devote significant additional resources and incur additional expenses to market our software products and services directly to potential customers.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P7_S10	In addition, we depend on Microsoft for developer releases of new versions of, and upgrades to, its Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile software in order to facilitate timely development and delivery of our own software and services.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P7_S11	If we are unable to maintain our favorable relationship with Microsoft and no longer continue receiving such new versions and updates, our revenue could decline significantly, and/or our costs could increase significantly, thereby negatively impacting our operating results.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P7_S12	Unexpected delays or announcement of delays by Microsoft related to product releases of Windows Embedded, Windows 8 Embedded or Windows Embedded 8 Handheld operating systems could adversely affect our revenue and operating results.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P7_S13	Unexpected delays or announcement of delays in Microsoft s delivery schedule for new versions of the various operating systems for Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile devices could cause us to delay our product introductions or impede our ability to sell our products and services and/or to complete customer projects on a timely basis.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P7_S14	Such delays or announcements of delays by Microsoft could also cause our customers to delay or cancel their project development activities or product introductions, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P7_S15	If Microsoft adds features to its Windows operating systems or develops products that directly compete with products and services we provide, our revenue and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P7_S16	As the developer of various operating systems for Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile devices, Microsoft could add features which eliminate or reduce our customers need for our software and services, or Microsoft could develop standalone products and services that compete with the products and services we provide to our customers.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P7_S17	The ability of our customers, or potential customers, to obtain products and services directly from Microsoft that compete with our products and services could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P7_S18	Even if the standard features of future Microsoft operating system software were more limited than our offerings, a significant number of our customers, and potential customers, might elect to accept more limited functionality in lieu of purchasing additional software from us or delay the purchase of our products and services while they perform a comparison of Microsoft s competing offerings.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P7_S19	Moreover, the resulting competitive pressures could lead to price reductions for our offerings and reduce our revenue and gross profit accordingly and our operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	If the markets for Windows Embedded, Windows 8 for Embedded, Windows Phone 8 and Windows Embedded 8 Handheld operating systems fail to develop further, develop more slowly than expected, or decline, our business and operating results may be materially harmed.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Because a significant portion of our revenue to date has been generated by software and services targeted at customers and devices utilizing the various Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, if the markets for these systems or platforms fail to develop further, or develop more slowly than expected, or decline, our business and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Market acceptance of Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems will depend on many factors, including:
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Microsoft s development and support of various Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile markets.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	In Motion Limited ( RIM and other proprietary operating systems.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	In particular, in the market for rugged handheld devices, Windows Mobile faces intense competition from the Android operating systems.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	In the market for converged devices, Windows Embedded faces intense competition from the Android operating system.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The willingness of software developers to continue to develop and expand the applications that run on Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	To the extent that software developers write applications for competing operating systems that are more attractive to smart device users than those available on Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, this could cause potential customers to select competing operating systems.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	MyFord Touch-Related Risk Factors If we do not obtain additional work on the MyFord Touch program through our new statement of work with Microsoft or elsewhere in the future, our future revenue and gross profit would decrease and our operating results would be adversely affected.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We began working on the MyFord Touch infotainment project with Ford in the second quarter of 2008 and have been working on the program since then although the main program was completed in August 2010.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Since inception of the program through December 31, 2011, our contractual relationship was with Ford.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Effective January 1, 2012, our contractual relationship for the MyFord Touch program shifted from Ford to Microsoft, as Microsoft has become the primary vendor to Ford for this program.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Revenue from Ford comprised $6.4 million, or 6%, of our total revenue in 2012.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P12_S5	We expect this project work to continue in 2013 under our new statement of work with Microsoft but expect revenue from the MyFord Touch program to be lower, albeit still significant in 2013, than it was in 2012 due to the lower level of personnel resources utilized on the program.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Our new statement of work with Microsoft currently runs through June 30, 2013.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P12_S7	While we expect to be actively involved in future projects with Microsoft and Ford beyond June 30, 2013, if our role on MyFord Touch is scaled back or eliminated beyond that point our revenue and resulting gross profit would suffer and negatively impact our operating results.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	General Business-Related Risk Factors Our marketplace is extremely competitive, which may result in price reductions, lower gross profit margins and loss of market share.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	The market for our software products and related services is extremely competitive.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Increased competition may result in lower revenue, price reductions, lower gross profit and margin and loss of customers and market share, which could negatively impact our operating results.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Mobile and embedded test automation providers including Perfecto Mobile, mVerify, JAMO Solutions, SmartBear Software (AutomatedQA), TestPlant (eggPlant) and Keynote.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating system distributors such as Arrow Electronics, Inc., Avnet, Inc., Synnex Corporation in Taiwan; and MDS Technology Co., Ltd in Korea.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Some of our competitors focus on only one aspect of our business or offer complementary products which can be integrated with our products.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	As we develop and bring to market new software products and service offerings, particularly offerings focused on specific industries and/or focused on devices utilizing non-Windows Embedded operating systems, we may begin competing with companies with which we have not previously competed.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Further, as we expand the geographic markets into which we sell our software solutions and related services, we may expect to increasingly compete with companies with which we have not previously competed.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P16_S3	It is also possible that new competitors will enter the market or that our competitors will form alliances, including alliances with Microsoft, that may enable them to rapidly increase their market share.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Microsoft has not agreed to any exclusive arrangement with us, nor has it agreed not to compete with us.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P16_S5	Microsoft may decide to bring more of the core embedded development services and expertise that we provide in-house, possibly resulting in reduced software and service revenue opportunities for us.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The barrier to entering the market as a provider of Windows-based smart device software and services is low.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	In addition, Microsoft has created marketing programs to encourage systems integrators to work on Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating system software and services.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P17_S2	These systems integrators are given substantially the same access by Microsoft to the Windows technology as we are.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P17_S3	New competitors may have lower overhead than we do and may be able to undercut our pricing.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P17_S4	We expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter the smart device market, and as new products and technologies are introduced.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Our ability to maintain or grow our proprietary software revenue is contingent on our ability to bring to market competitive, unique offerings that keep pace with technological changes and needs.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P17_S6	If we are not successful in doing so, our business would be negatively impacted.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Proprietary software product revenue provides us with much higher gross profit margins than we typically receive from third-party software products and our engineering service offerings and provide other advantages as well.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Increasing the number and amount of proprietary products we sell is an important part of our growth strategy.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	to devise, develop and introduce new products.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or expand the number of proprietary products that we sell, and our failure to do so could negatively impact revenue and our operating results.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We may experience delays in our efforts to develop new products and services, and these delays could cause us to miss market opportunities which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The market for our software and services evolves rapidly.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	As a result, the life cycles of our products and services are difficult to estimate.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P20_S2	To be successful, we believe we must continue to enhance our current offerings and provide new software and service offerings with attractive features, prices and terms that appeal to our customers.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P20_S3	We have experienced delays in new software and service offering introductions in the past and may do so again in the future.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Our revenue and operating results may be negatively impacted if we delay releases of new products, product enhancements and/or new services offerings, or if we fail to accurately anticipate our customers needs or technical trends and are unable to introduce new products and service offerings into the market successfully.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P20_S5	In addition, our customers may defer or forego purchases of our products and/or services if we, Microsoft, our competitors or major hardware, systems or software vendors introduce or announce new products.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Our future success depends upon our customers ability to successfully sell their products incorporating our technology, and to continue buying our services.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P20_S7	Even if a customer selects us to provide software and services, the customer may not ultimately market and sell its product successfully.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P20_S8	A cancellation or change in plans by a customer, whether from lack of market acceptance of its products or otherwise, could cause us to lose revenue that we had anticipated and our revenue and operating results would suffer.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P20_S9	Also, our revenue and operating results could suffer if a significant customer reduces or delays orders during our sales cycle or chooses not to release products that contain our technology.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P20_S10	If the market for smart, connected systems evolves based on technologies that we do not support, our revenue may not grow as anticipated, if at all, and our business would be harmed.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The technologies used in smart, connected systems change very rapidly and it is often difficult to forsee and predict which application processors, operating systems, connectivity, testing and application development technologies will gain a foothold in device development.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	As a smaller company we can invest our resources in a limited number of technologies and as such must make forward investments in developing products and capabilities to support the technologies that we choose.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P21_S2	If we make investments in technologies that do not gain traction in device development, our profit potential is uncertain and our revenue may not develop as anticipated.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P21_S3	We are dependent upon the broad acceptance and adoption by businesses and consumers of a wide variety of device technologies, which will depend on many factors, including:
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The amount of discretionary funds companies and individuals have to spend for the latest technologies.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The success and profitability of our service offerings are contingent on our ability to differentiate these offerings adequately in the marketplace, which is, in turn, contingent on our ability to retain our engineering personnel and defend our billing rate structure against those of our competitors, including those using significant lower-cost offshore resources.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P22_S2	If we are unable to do so successfully, our business could be harmed.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P22_S3	We are a leader in providing engineering services to smart device customers.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our differentiation is contingent, in part, on our ability to attract and retain employees with this expertise, a significant portion of which are currently based in the United States.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	To the extent we are unable to retain critical engineering services talent and/or our competition is able to deliver the same services by using significant lower-cost offshore resources, our service revenue and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P23_S2	The success and profitability of our service engagements are contingent upon our ability to scope and bid engagements and deliver our services profitably.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P23_S3	If we are unable to do so, our service revenue service gross profit margin and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Various factors may cause the total cost of service projects to exceed the original estimate provided to the customer or the contractual maximum in the case of fixed price contracts, including specification changes, customer deliverable delays, inadequate scoping and inefficient service delivery.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P24_S1	If we are unable to adequately scope, bid and deliver on service engagements successfully, our service revenue, service gross margin and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P24_S2	In addition, depending on the cause of an overrun for a given customer and project, we may also decide to provide pricing concessions to that customer which could negatively impact our service revenue, service gross profit and operating results.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We periodically enter into engineering service agreements in which we have agreed to perform our engineering service work for lower up-front fees, or for no fees, in exchange for future royalties or per unit fees.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	There is no guarantee that these arrangements will produce the strategic or economic returns as anticipated.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P25_S2	We have entered into contracts that involve reducing or eliminating up-front engineering service fees in return for a per-device/chip royalty or fee that is earned as our customers ship their devices or chips, and we may enter into more such agreements in the future.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Because we are delaying revenue past the point where our services are performed, there is a risk that our customers may cancel their projects or that their devices or chips may not be successful in the market, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Cooperation and support from silicon vendors is critical for the success of our products and related services that are developed for their particular silicon architecture.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P25_S5	We have developed, and continue to develop, software and service offerings based on certain silicon architectures (e.g. the TI OMAP architecture).
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Due to the nature of the industry we serve and the products we develop, it is necessary for us to make certain assumptions regarding which silicon vendors will be successful in the various markets we serve and upon which we are making investments.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	It is therefore important that there is ongoing support from the SVs in the marketplace for these silicon architectures.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P26_S2	There can be no assurance that, TI, Qualcomm, Freescale, Intel or any of the other SVs, will continue to pursue and support the markets that we have been targeting.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P26_S3	If the SVs do not support our efforts going forward, our revenue and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P26_S4	The long sales cycle of our products and services makes our revenue susceptible to fluctuations.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P26_S5	Our sales cycle is typically three to nine months because the expense and complexity of the software and service offerings we sell generally require a lengthy customer approval process and may be subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control, including:
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The timing of customers competitive evaluation processes.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	In addition, to successfully sell our software and engineering service offerings, we must frequently educate our potential customers about the full benefits of our software and services, which can require significant time.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P27_S2	If our sales cycle further lengthens unexpectedly, it could adversely affect the timing of our revenue, which could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Erosion of the financial condition of our customers could adversely affect our business.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Our business could be adversely affected if the financial condition of our customers erodes because such erosion could reduce demand from those customers for our software and engineering services.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P28_S2	This could also cause them to terminate their relationships with us, and/or could increase the risk that such customers default on their payment obligations to us.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Additionally, while we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate, economic trends may cause more companies to default or cease operations, in which case our allowances may not cover actual losses, which could adversely affect our operating results.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Our business and operations would be adversely impacted in the event of a failure or interruption of our information technology infrastructure.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P28_S5	The proper functioning of our information technology infrastructure is critical to the efficient operation and management of our business.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P28_S6	Our technology infrastructure is vulnerable to cyber attacks, computer viruses, worms and other malicious software programs, physical and electronic break-ins, sabotage and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P28_S7	We believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology infrastructure and our operations from these information technology-related and other potential disruptions.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P28_S8	However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P28_S9	We may be subject to product liability claims that could result in significant costs.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P28_S10	Our software license and service agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims with the notable exception of the portion of the MyFord Touch project contracted with Ford.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P28_S11	It is possible, however, that these provisions may be ineffective under the laws of certain jurisdictions or that our customers may not agree to these limitations.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P28_S12	Although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date, the sale and support of our products and services may be subject to such claims in the future.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P28_S13	There is a risk that any such claims or liabilities may exceed, or fall outside, the scope of our insurance coverage, and we may be unable to retain adequate liability insurance in the future.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P28_S14	A product liability claim brought against us, whether successful or not, could negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P28_S15	Negative business conditions, changes in useful lives, and other factors may negatively affect the carrying value of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	In the fourth quarter of 2008, we purchased certain assets of TestQuest including acquired technology and other intangible assets with a total gross carrying value of $1.9 million, and which had a carrying value of $142,000 as of December 31, 2012.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P29_S1	During the fourth quarter of 2011, we assessed that the net carrying value of the remaining intangible assets associated with acquired technology from TestQuest was impaired due to slow sales of the product that incorporates this technology.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P29_S2	As such, in that quarter we recognized an impairment charge of $518,000 as software cost of revenue which negatively impacted our gross profit and operating results.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P29_S3	In the third quarter of 2011, we acquired MPC Data Limited including certain intangible assets with a carrying value of $1.2 million and goodwill of $3.7 million as of December 31, 2012.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Although we expect to generate cash from the intangible assets in the future, and do not foresee any impairment of our goodwill, it is possible that we may be required to reassess the carrying value of these assets in the future if certain negative business conditions occur such as negative results of our business associated with our intangible assets or a low stock price.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	charge that would negatively impact our operating results.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Further, business conditions and other factors may also require us to reassess the useful lives associated with intangible assets.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Past acquisitions have proven difficult to integrate, and recent or future acquisitions, if any, could disrupt our business, dilute shareholder value and negatively affect our operating results.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We have acquired the technologies, assets and/or operations of other companies in the past and may acquire or make investments in companies, products, services and technologies in the future as part of our growth strategy.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P31_S1	If we fail to properly evaluate, integrate and execute on our acquisitions and investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P31_S2	To successfully complete an acquisition, we must properly evaluate the technology, market and management team, accurately forecast the financial impact of the transaction, including accounting charges and transaction expenses, integrate and retain personnel, combine potentially different corporate cultures and effectively integrate products and research and development, sales, marketing and support operations.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P31_S3	If we fail to do any of these, we may suffer losses and impair relationships with our employees, customers and strategic partners.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Additionally, management may be distracted from day-to-day operations.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P31_S5	We also may be unable to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, which are especially critical in light of Sarbanes-Oxley and other corporate governance requirements, and significant demands may be placed on our management and our operations, information services and financial, legal and marketing resources.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P31_S6	Finally, acquired businesses sometimes result in unexpected liabilities and contingencies, which may involve compliance with foreign laws, payment of taxes, labor negotiations or other unknown costs and expenses, which could be significant.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We may not be able to raise additional capital if required to support our business.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P32_S1	If we need to raise additional operating capital, we may find that our access to equity and debt capital markets is limited or blocked entirely.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P32_S2	In the past, our stock has traded at low volumes and overall investor confidence in the stock market could falter.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P32_S3	This could make it difficult or impossible to sell additional shares on the public markets.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P32_S4	In addition, it may be difficult and costly to obtain debt financing and we may be unable to borrow additional funds at acceptable cost, or at all, should the need arise.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P32_S5	If we are unable to raise capital as necessary, it may adversely affect our ability to invest in products or fund operations, which would materially harm our business and negatively affect operating results.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Taxing jurisdictions in the United States are becoming more aggressive with tax legislation and tax collection, particularly states facing significant budget deficits, which could expose us to additional tax liability that we have not been subject to in the past.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We make sales in many jurisdictions across the United States, most of which we do not have nexus in and, therefore, are not subject to sales, franchise, income and other state and local taxes.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Particularly in light of state revenue deficits, taxing jurisdictions have become more aggressive in defining nexus, among other things, which could result in us achieving nexus, or potentially achieving nexus in significantly more tax jurisdictions.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P33_S3	If this occurs and unless we are able to pass through this cost to our customers, our tax expense will increase which will negatively affect our results of operations.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Further, because state and local tax laws are becoming increasingly complex, our cost to monitor our state and local tax compliance will increase which will negatively affect our results of operations.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P33_S5	Additionally, there can be no assurance that we do not currently have unknown tax exposure in a state or local tax jurisdiction because of recent tax law changes which we are unaware of and the resulting liability could be significant and would negatively affect our results of operations.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	There may be restrictions on the use of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards due to a tax law ownership change.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code restricts the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	approximately $57 million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, and $2.5 million of tax credit carryforwards.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Under the applicable tax rules, an ownership change occurs if greater than five percent shareholders of an issuer s outstanding common stock collectively increase their ownership percentage by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P37_S1	We have performed analyses of possible ownership changes which included consideration of a third-party study, and do not believe that an ownership change (as defined by this Section) has occurred.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P37_S2	However, if a tax law ownership change has occurred of which we are not aware, or if a tax law ownership change occurs in the future, we may have to adjust the valuation of our deferred tax assets, and could be at risk of having to pay income taxes notwithstanding the existence of our sizable carryforwards.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P37_S3	Further, to the extent that we have utilized our carryforwards from prior years, the existence of a previous tax law ownership change that we did not account for could result in liability for back taxes, interest, and penalties.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P37_S4	If we are unable to utilize our carryforwards and/or if we previously utilized carryforwards to which we were not entitled, it would negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P37_S5	Non-compliance with our lease agreement could have a material adverse impact on our financial position.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P37_S6	Under the terms of our corporate headquarters lease signed in February 2004, if we default under the lease, the landlord has the ability to demand cash payments forgiven in 2004.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P37_S7	The amount of the forgiven payments for which the landlord has the ability to demand repayment was $400,000 at December 31, 2012, and decreases on a straight-line basis over the length of our ten-year headquarters lease which expires in August 2014.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P37_S8	Any breach of or non-compliance with this lease agreement could negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P37_S9	Intellectual Property-Related Risk Factors Our software and service offerings could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which could expose us to additional costs and litigation and could adversely affect our ability to sell our products and services or cause shipment delays or stoppages.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P37_S10	It is difficult to determine whether our software and engineering services infringe third-party intellectual property rights, particularly in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which technologies often overlap and where there may be numerous patent applications pending, many of which are confidential when filed.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P37_S11	If we were to discover that one of our software or service offerings, or a product based on one of our reference designs, violated a third-party s proprietary rights, we may not be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, to continue offering that product or service.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P37_S12	Similarly, third parties may claim that our current or future software products and services infringe their proprietary rights, regardless of whether such claims have merit.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P37_S13	Any such claims could increase our costs and negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	In certain cases, we have been unable to obtain indemnification against claims that third-party technology incorporated into our software products and services infringe the proprietary rights of others.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P38_S1	However, any indemnification we do obtain may be limited in scope or amount.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Even if we receive broad third-party indemnification, these entities may not have the financial capability to indemnify us in the event of infringement.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P38_S3	In addition, in some circumstances we are required to indemnify our customers for claims made against them that are based on our software products or services.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P38_S4	There can be no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims related to the software products and services we provide, or arising from the incorporation by us of third-party technology, and claims for indemnification from our customers resulting from such claims, will not be asserted or prosecuted against us.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P38_S5	Some of our competitors have, or are affiliated, with companies with substantially greater resources than we have, and these competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than we could.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P38_S6	In addition, we expect that software developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the software industry grows, and as the functionality of products in different industry segments increasingly overlap.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P38_S7	Such claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources in addition to potential product redevelopment costs and delays.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	may be prohibited from developing or commercializing certain of our technologies and products, or delivering services based on the infringing technology, unless we obtain a license from the holder of the patent or other intellectual property rights.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P39_S1	There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain any such license on commercially favorable terms, or at all.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P39_S2	If such license is not obtained, we would be required to cease these related business operations, which could negatively impact our business, revenue and operating results.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P39_S3	If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may be able to use our technology or trademarks, which could weaken our competitive position, reduce our revenue and increase our costs.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P39_S4	If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, our competitive position could be weakened and our revenue and operating results adversely affected.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P39_S5	We rely primarily on confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions as well as a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, to protect our intellectual property.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P39_S6	These laws and procedures provide only limited protection.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P39_S7	It is possible that another party could obtain patents that block our use of some, or all, of our software and services.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P39_S8	If that occurred, we would need to obtain a license from the patent holder or design around those patents.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P39_S9	The patent holder may or may not choose to make a license available to us at all, or on acceptable terms.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P39_S10	Similarly, it may not be possible to design around a blocking patent.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P39_S11	In general, there can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws will be effective to prevent misappropriation of our technology, or to prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to or competitive with those developed by us.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We frequently license the source code of our software products and the source code results of our services to customers.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P40_S1	There can be no assurance that customers with access to our source code will comply with the license terms or that we will discover any violations of the license terms or, in the event of discovery of violations, that we will be able to successfully enforce the license terms and/or recover the economic value lost from such violations.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	To license some of our software products, we rely in part on shrinkwrap and clickwrap licenses that are not signed by the end user and, therefore, may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P41_S1	As with other software, our software products are susceptible to unauthorized copying and uses that may go undetected, and policing such unauthorized use is difficult.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P42_S0	A significant portion of our marks include the word BSQUARE.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Other companies use forms of BSQUARE in their marks alone, or in combination with other words, and we cannot prevent all such third-party uses.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We license certain trademark rights to third parties.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Such licensees may not abide by our compliance and quality control guidelines with respect to such trademark rights.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Any of these outcomes could negatively impact our brand, dilute its recognition in the marketplace, or confuse potential customers, all of which could harm our business.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The computer software market is characterized by frequent and substantial intellectual property litigation, which is often complex and expensive, and involves a significant diversion of resources and uncertainty of outcome.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property or to defend against a claim of infringement or invalidity.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Litigation could result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources and could negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Our software or hardware products or the third-party hardware or software integrated with our products or delivered as part of our service offerings may suffer from defects or errors that could impair our ability to sell our products and services.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P44_S4	Software and hardware components as complex as those needed for smart devices frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P44_S5	We have had to delay commercial release of certain versions of our products until problems were corrected and, in some cases, have provided product enhancements to correct errors in released products.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P44_S6	Some of our contracts require us to repair or replace products that fail to work.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P44_S7	To the extent that we repair or replace products our expenses may increase.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Moreover, to the extent that we provide increasingly comprehensive products and services, particularly those focused on hardware, and rely on third-party manufacturers and suppliers to manufacture these products, we will be dependent on the ability of third-party manufacturers to correct, identify and prevent manufacturing errors.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Errors that are discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance, diversion of development resources, damage to our reputation and increased service and warranty costs, all of which could negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P45_S2	If we are unable to license key software from third parties, our business could be harmed.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P45_S3	We sometimes integrate third-party software with our proprietary software and engineering service offerings or sell such third-party software offerings on a standalone basis (e.g. Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems under our ODA with Microsoft).
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P45_S4	If our relationships with these third-party software vendors were to deteriorate, or be eliminated in their entirety, we might be unable to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P45_S5	In the event that we are unable to obtain these third-party software offerings, we would be required to develop this technology internally, assuming it was economically or technically feasible, or seek similar software offerings from other third parties assuming there were competing offerings in the marketplace, which could delay or limit our ability to introduce enhancements or new products, or to continue to sell existing products and engineering services, thereby negatively impacting our revenue and operating results.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Governance-Related Risk Factors It might be difficult for a third-party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation, bylaws and Washington law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in the control of us or a change in our management, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Our Board of Directors has the authority under our amended and restated articles of incorporation to issue preferred stock with rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P46_S3	As a result, preferred stock could be issued quickly and easily with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make removal of our management more difficult.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P46_S4	In addition, our Board of Directors is divided into three classes.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P46_S5	The directors in each class serve for three-year terms, one class being elected each year by our shareholders.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P46_S6	This system of electing and removing directors may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company because it generally makes it more difficult for shareholders to replace a majority of our directors.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P46_S7	In addition, Chapter 19 of the Washington Business Corporation Act generally prohibits a target corporation from engaging in certain significant business transactions with a defined acquiring person for a period of five years after the acquisition, unless the transaction or acquisition of shares is approved by a majority of the members of the target corporation s Board of Directors prior to the time of acquisition.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P46_S8	This provision may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of our company.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P46_S9	The existence of these anti-takeover provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P47_S0	International Operations-Related Risk Factors Our international operations expose us to greater intellectual property, management, collections, regulatory and other risks.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Customers outside of North America generated 29% of our total revenue in 2012 and 23% in 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P47_S2	We have expanded rapidly, particularly during 2011, including establishing presences in Korea and China and our MPC acquisition in September 2011 which significantly increased our presence in Europe.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P47_S3	We currently have sizable operations outside of North America in Taiwan, China and the United Kingdom and also have a limited sales and/or support presence in Japan, South Korea and Germany.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P47_S4	Our international activities and operations, and our current expansion plans expose us to a number of risks, including the following:
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Complex and/or adverse tax laws and/or changes thereto.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The inherent risks of working in a certain highly regulated and/or controlled economies where relationships between company management and government officials is critical to timely processing of approvals required to conduct business.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P49_S1	These risks could have a material adverse effect on the financial and managerial resources required to operate our foreign offices, as well as on our future international revenue, which could negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P49_S2	As we increase the amount of software development conducted in non-U.S. locations, potential delays and quality issues may impact our ability to timely deliver our software and services, potentially impacting our revenue and profitability.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P49_S3	We conduct development activities in non-U.S. locations, primarily China, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom, to take advantage of the high-quality, low-cost software development resources found in those countries.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P49_S4	To date, we have limited experience in managing large scale software development outside the United States.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P49_S5	Expanding our international software development inherently increases the complexity of managing these programs and may result in delays in introducing new products to market, or delays in completing service projects for our customers, which in turn may adversely impact the revenue we recognize from related software products and services and could also adversely impact the profitability of service engagements employing offshore resources, thereby negatively affecting our operating results.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P49_S6	As our customers seek more cost-effective locations to develop and manufacture their products, particularly overseas locations, our ability to continue to sell these customers our software products and services could be limited, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P49_S7	Due to competitive and other pressures, some of our customers have moved, and others may seek to move, the development and manufacturing of their smart devices to overseas locations, which may limit our ability to sell these customers our software and services.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P49_S8	As an example, under our ODA with Microsoft, we are currently only able to sell Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems primarily in North America, the United Kingdom and Germany.
1054721_13_ITEM1A_P49_S9	If our customers, or potential customers, move their manufacturing overseas we may be restricted from reselling Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems to these customers or we would be less competitive, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our corporate headquarters are located in 43,400 square feet of leased space in a single location in Bellevue, Washington.
1054721_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	The underlying lease expires in 2014.
1054721_13_ITEM2_P0_S2	In North America, we also lease office space in San Diego, California; Boston, Massachusetts; and Akron, Ohio.
1054721_13_ITEM2_P0_S3	We lease office space overseas in Beijing, China, Seoul, Korea, Tokyo, Japan, Taipei, Taiwan, Munich, Germany and Trowbridge, United Kingdom.
1054721_13_ITEM2_P0_S4	Our facilities have sufficient capacity to support our current operational needs as well as short-term growth plans.
1054721_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol BSQR.
1054721_13_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table sets forth the high and low closing prices for our common stock for the periods indicated, as reported by the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
1054721_13_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of January 31, 2013, there were 132 holders of record of our common stock.
1054721_13_ITEM5_P1_S1	Because many shares of our common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of shareholders, we are unable to determine the total number of shareholders represented by these holders of record.
1054721_13_ITEM5_P1_S2	Dividends We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock.
1054721_13_ITEM5_P1_S3	We currently intend to retain any future earnings to fund future development and growth and, therefore, do not anticipate paying any consistent cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1054721_13_ITEM5_P1_S4	Our Board of Directors has, however, periodically considered implementing a share repurchase program and/or a special one-time cash dividend.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P0_S1	This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations may contain some statements and information which are not historical facts but are forward-looking statements.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P0_S2	For a discussion of these forward-looking statements, and of important factors that could cause results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this report, see Item 1 of Part I, Business Forward-Looking Statements, and Item 1A of Part I, Risk Factors.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	We provide software solutions and related engineering services to companies that develop smart, connected systems.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	A smart, connected system is a dedicated purpose computing device that typically has a display, runs an operating system (e.g., Microsoft Windows Embedded Compact) and is usually connected to a network or data cloud via a wired or wireless connection.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	Examples of smart, connected systems include set-top boxes, home gateways, point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, voting machines, gaming platforms, tablets, handheld data collection devices, personal media players, smart phones, in-vehicle telematics and entertainment devices.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P2_S2	We primarily focus on smart, connected systems that utilize various Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, specifically Windows Embedded Compact, Windows Embedded Standard 7 and 8, Windows Mobile , Windows Phone 8 and Windows Embedded 8 Handheld as well as devices running other popular operating systems such as Android, Linux, and QNX.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	We have been providing software solutions to the connected device marketplace since our inception.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	Our customers include world class original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ), original design manufacturers ( ODMs ) and enterprises, as well as silicon vendors ( SVs ) and peripheral vendors which purchase our software solutions for purposes of facilitating processor and peripheral sales to the aforementioned customer categories.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P3_S2	In the case of enterprises, our customers include those which develop, market and distribute smart devices on their own behalf as well as those that purchase devices from OEMs or ODMs and require additional device software or testing.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P3_S3	The software solutions we provide are utilized and deployed throughout various phases of our customers device life cycle, including design, development, customization, quality assurance and deployment.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	Critical Accounting Judgments Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from software and engineering service sales when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the selling price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	Contracts and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P4_S2	Shipping documents and time records are generally used to verify delivery.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P4_S3	We assess whether the selling price is fixed or determinable based on the contract and/or customer purchase order and payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P4_S4	We assess collectability based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer s payment history.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P4_S5	Periodically, we will begin work on engineering service engagements prior to having a signed contract and, in some cases, the contract is signed in a quarter after which service delivery costs are incurred.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P4_S6	We do not defer costs associated with such engagements before we have received a signed contract.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P4_S7	We recognize software revenue upon shipment provided that no significant obligations remain on our part, substantive acceptance conditions, if any, have been met and the other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	Service revenue from time and materials contracts, and training service agreements, is recognized as services are performed.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	Fixed-price service agreements, and certain time and materials service agreements with capped fee structures, are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	on the nature and scope of these engineering service contracts; we believe it is a better measure of periodic income results than other methods and better matches revenue recognized with the costs incurred.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	Percentage of completion is measured based primarily on input measures such as hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	Significant judgment is required when estimating total hours and progress to completion on these arrangements which determines the amount of revenue we recognize as well as whether a loss is recognized if one is expected to be incurred for the remainder of the project.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	Revisions to hour and cost estimates are incorporated in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	We also enter into arrangements in which a customer purchases a combination of software licenses, engineering services and post-contract customer support and/or maintenance ( PCS ).
1054721_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	As a result, contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting, including how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements if there are multiple elements.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	PCS may include rights to upgrades, when and if available, telephone support, updates and enhancements.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	When vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) of fair value exists for all elements in a multiple element arrangement, revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each of the elements.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	VSOE of fair value is established by the price charged when the same element is sold separately.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P11_S2	Accordingly, the judgments involved in assessing the fair values of various elements of an agreement can impact the recognition of revenue in each period.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P11_S3	Changes in the allocation of the sales price between deliverables might impact the timing of revenue recognition, but would not change the total revenue recognized on the contract.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	When elements such as software and engineering services are contained in a single arrangement, or in related arrangements with the same customer, we allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value, provided that such element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	In the absence of fair value for a delivered element, revenue is first allocated to the fair value of the undelivered elements and then allocated to the residual delivered elements.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P12_S2	In the absence of fair value for an undelivered element, the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting, resulting in a delay of revenue recognition for the delivered elements until the undelivered elements are fulfilled.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	When engineering services and royalties are contained in a single arrangement, we recognize revenue from engineering services as earned in accordance with the criteria above even though the effective rate per hour may be lower than typical because the customer is contractually obligated to pay royalties on their device shipments.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	We recognize royalty revenue, classified as software revenue, when the royalty report from the customer is received or when such royalties are contractually guaranteed and the other revenue recognition criteria are met, particularly that collectability is reasonably assured.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P13_S2	There are two items involving revenue recognition that require us to make more difficult and subjective judgments: the determination of VSOE of fair value in multiple element arrangements and the estimation of percentage of completion on fixed-price service contracts.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	Historically, we have entered into very few multiple-element arrangements other than those involving the sale of PCS related to our TestQuest automated testing tools.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	We establish VSOE of fair value for TestQuest PCS based on the price when PCS is sold separately.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	VSOE of TestQuest PCS has been well established in the past as these products have been sold on a stand-alone basis for a number of years even prior to our acquisition of TestQuest assets in November 2008.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	We measure our estimate of completion on fixed-price contracts, which in turn determines the amount of revenue we recognize, based primarily on actual hours incurred to date and our estimate of remaining hours necessary to complete the contract.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	The process of estimating the remaining hours on a contract involves detailed estimates of remaining hours by the engineers and project managers involved with the project, factoring in such variables as the remaining tasks, the complexity of the tasks, the contracted quality of the software to be provided, the customer s estimated delivery date, integration of third-party software and quality thereof and other factors.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	Every fixed-price contract requires various approvals within our company, including our Chief Executive Officer if significant.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	This approval process takes into consideration a number of factors including the complexity of engineering.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	Historically, our estimation processes related to fixed-price contracts have been accurate based on the information known at the time of the reporting of our results.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	As of December 31, 2012, we were delivering engineering services under 6 fixed-price service contracts.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	The percentage of completion calculations on these contracts represents management s best estimates based on the facts and circumstances as of the filing of this report.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P20_S2	If there are changes to the underlying facts and circumstances, revisions to the percentage-of-completion calculations will be recorded in the period the changes are noted.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P20_S3	If we were 10% under in our estimates of completion on every fixed-bid contract active on December 31, 2012, our revenue would be over-stated by $180,000 for 2012.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	Intangible Assets and Goodwill We evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	Our intangible assets were acquired through business acquisitions.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P21_S2	Our intangible assets consist of acquired technology, customer relationships, trade names and trademarks, and non-compete agreements.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P21_S3	Factors that could trigger an impairment analysis include significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	If this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired, we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	If this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining useful life, we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P22_S2	Any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P22_S3	During the fourth quarter of 2011, we recognized an impairment charge of $518,000 related to technology acquired from TestQuest in 2008.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	Our annual testing date is December 31.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P23_S2	We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P23_S3	If it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount, further testing of impairment is not performed.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	If it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, we perform a quantitative two-step impairment test.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	Our stock-based compensation expense for stock options is estimated at the grant date based on the stock award s fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton ( BSM ) option-pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	The BSM model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and option life.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P25_S2	If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	Restricted stock units ( RSUs ) and restricted stock awards ( RSAs ) are measured based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant as determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	To the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimates, stock-based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	Incentive Compensation We make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions regarding the likelihood of attainment, and the level thereof, of bonuses payable under our annual incentive compensation programs.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	We accrue bonuses and recognize the resulting expense when the bonus is judged to be reasonably likely to be earned as of year-end and is estimable.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P28_S2	The amount accrued, and expense recognized, is the estimated portion of the bonus earned on a year-to-date basis less any amounts previously accrued.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	results for the remainder of the year.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	Because we consider estimated future results in assessing the likelihood of attainment, significant judgment is required.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	If actual results differ materially from our estimates, the amount of bonus expense recorded in a particular quarter could be significantly over or under estimated.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the countries and other jurisdictions in which we operate.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	This process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P31_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P31_S3	Net operating losses and tax credits, to the extent not already utilized to offset taxable income or income taxes, also give rise to deferred tax assets.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P31_S4	We must then assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income, and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P31_S5	Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	We estimate the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	Our sales may be subject to other taxes, particularly withholding taxes, due to our sales to customers in countries other than the United States.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P32_S2	The tax regulations governing withholding taxes are complex, causing us to have to make assumptions about the appropriate tax treatment.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P32_S3	Further, we make sales in many jurisdictions across the United States, where tax regulations are varied and at times complex.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P32_S4	We must therefore continue to analyze our state tax exposure and determine what the appropriate tax treatments are, and make estimates for sales, franchise, income and other state taxes.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	The following table presents certain financial data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	Our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 Acquisition of MPC Data Limited On September 11, 2011 we completed the acquisition of MPC Data Limited ( MPC ), a United Kingdom-based provider of embedded software engineering services.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P35_S1	The acquisition is part of our overall growth strategy and is designed to capitalize on the growing market for smart, connected systems by expanding both the breadth of services offered and the geographies that we serve.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P35_S2	As the acquisition took place late in the third quarter of 2011, the impact on our results of operations for 2011 was relatively insignificant for the year in total.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P35_S3	Where applicable, the MPC-related impacts have been noted in the following commentary.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	Our revenue is generated from the sale of software, both our own proprietary software and third-party software that we resell, and the sale of engineering services.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	Total revenue was $101.4 million in 2012 and was $96.8 million in 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P36_S2	An increase in sales of Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems drove the increase, offset partially by a decline in service revenue.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P36_S3	Revenue from our customers outside of North America increased $7.4 million, or 33%, to $29.5 million in 2012, from $22.1 million in 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P36_S4	Revenue from our customers outside of North America represented 29% of our total revenue in 2012, compared to 23% in 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P36_S5	The increase in non-North American revenue in 2012 was attributable to higher service revenue in Europe driven by the September 2011 acquisition of MPC as well as an increase in service revenue and third party software sales in Asia.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	Software revenue Software revenue consists of sales of third-party software and revenue realized from our own proprietary software products, which include software license sales, royalties from our software products, sales of software development kits, support and maintenance revenue, and royalties from certain engineering service contracts.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	Software revenue for 2012 and 2011 was as follows (dollars in thousands):
1054721_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	The vast majority of our third-party software revenue is comprised of sales of Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	Third-party software sales increased $8.4 million, or 13%, in 2012 as compared to the prior year.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P38_S2	This increase was due to higher sales of both Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems which increased $8.6 million.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P38_S3	Sales of Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems increased $5.0 million or 11% in 2012 as compared to the prior year driven by expansion into the EMEA region as well as significant increases in sales to some of our existing customer base.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P38_S4	Sales of Microsoft Windows Mobile operating systems increased $3.6 million or 26% driven primarily by the addition of a new customer in North America.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P38_S5	Our rights to distribute Windows Mobile operating systems in Korea ended on October 31, 2012.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P38_S6	We sold $4.5 million of Windows Mobile operating systems in Korea in 2012 and $4.6 million in 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	Proprietary software revenue decreased $897,000, or 16%, in 2012 compared to 2011 due primarily to the fact that the sale of Qualcomm development platforms were classified as proprietary software revenue for the first three quarters of 2011, whereas in 2012 and for the fourth quarter of 2011, they were classified as third-party software sales.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	Proprietary software revenue in 2011 included $929,000 of Qualcomm development platform sales classified as proprietary software revenue.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P39_S2	Service revenue Service revenue for 2012 and 2011 was as follows (dollars in thousands):
1054721_13_ITEM7_P39_S3	Service revenue decreased $3.0 million, or 10%, in 2012 as compared to the prior year.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P39_S4	This decrease was due to a $6.7 million decline in North America service revenue offset in part by a $2.5 million increase in Europe service revenue resulting from the MPC acquisition in September 2011 and a $1.1 million increase in Asia service revenue driven by growth in Japan due to the signing of several significant OEM customers.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P39_S5	The decline in North America service revenue was due to a $3.3 million decline in MyFord Touch-related service revenue as described below while the remainder was attributable to two large customers in 2011 which contributed $3.2 million in service revenue compared to no similarly large projects in 2012.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	Microsoft Corporation ( Microsoft ) became our largest engineering services customer during the first quarter of 2012, replacing Ford Motor Company ( Ford ), as Microsoft replaced Ford as the invoiced customer on the MyFord Touch program.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P40_S1	We continue to work on the MyFord Touch, a project we began with Ford during the second quarter of 2008; however, we now conduct these services through an agreement with Microsoft.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P40_S2	During the initial project with Ford, we provided hardware design and implementation, platform level software development, application level software development, quality assurance services and systems integration services.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P40_S3	The project has transitioned since the initial project such that we are now primarily focused on developing and integrating new user applications for the MyFord Touch, enhancing existing applications and customizing the MyFord Touch platform for additional vehicle models.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	The MyFord Touch program contributed $6.4 million in service revenue in 2012 compared to $9.7 million in 2011 representing a decline of $3.3 million or 34%.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P41_S1	The decrease is attributable to a reduction in the number of engineers working on the MyFord Touch project as the amount of work on the increasingly mature platform has declined.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	Gross profit and gross margin Cost of revenue related to software revenue consists primarily of the cost of third-party software products payable to third-party vendors.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P42_S1	Cost of revenue related to service revenue consists primarily of salaries and benefits, contractor costs and re-billable expenses, related facilities and depreciation costs, and amortization of certain intangible assets related to acquisitions.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P42_S2	Gross profit on the sale of third-party software products was also positively affected by rebate credits of $888,000 in 2012 and $746,000 in 2011 from Microsoft which we earned through the achievement of defined objectives.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	The following table outlines software, services and total gross profit (dollars in thousands): Software gross profit and gross margin Software gross profit increased by $1.5 million, or 12%, in 2012, compared to 2011, while software gross margin was 19% in both years.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P43_S1	The gross profit increase was driven by higher sales of Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems which accounted for a $1.6 million increase in software gross profit.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P43_S2	Third-party software gross margin was 16% in 2012 compared to 15% in 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P43_S3	Proprietary software gross margin was 78% in 2012 compared to 65% in 2011 with the improvement attributable to a $518,000 impairment charge related to acquired TestQuest technology which negatively affected the fourth quarter of 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P43_S4	Service gross profit and gross margin Service gross profit decreased by $1.9 million, or 31%, in 2012 as compared to 2011, while service gross margin decreased by five percentage points to 17% in 2012, from 22% in 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P43_S5	The decline in service gross profit was largely driven by the decrease in engineering service revenue of $3.0 million.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P43_S6	Service costs decreased by $1.1 million or 5% in 2012 compared to 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P43_S7	While cost per available hour decreased by approximately 10% primarily as a result of mix of resources internationally, it was more than offset by a decline in utilization rate of 12% and a decline in realized rate per hour of 2%.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	During 2012, we made adjustments to reduce service related expenses to better align with our future service revenue expectations.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	Operating expenses Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, commissions and bonuses for our sales, marketing and administrative personnel and related facilities and depreciation costs, as well as professional services fees (e.g., consulting, legal and audit).
1054721_13_ITEM7_P45_S1	Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $2.4 million, or 14%, to $14.3 million in 2012, from $16.7 million in 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P45_S2	Sales expense declined $2.7 million in 2012 compared to 2011, while marketing and general and administrative expense increased slightly.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P45_S3	The decrease in sales expense was driven by a $1.6 million decline in headcount-related expenses, including incentive compensation and travel, due to reductions which occurred during 2012, a portion of which were backfilled in the fourth quarter of 2012 or may be backfilled in 2013.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P45_S4	Further, sales-related stock compensation expense decreased $975,000 in 2012 compared to 2011 due largely to the departure of our previous Vice President of Sales in 2012 which resulted in a significant forfeiture of unvested stock options in the third quarter of 2012.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P45_S5	Selling, general and administrative expenses represented 14% of our total revenue in 2012 compared to 17% of revenue in 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P45_S6	Research and development Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for software development and quality assurance personnel, contractor and consultant costs and related facilities and depreciation costs.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	The decline was driven by lower wage expense in the second half of 2012 associated primarily with reductions in headcount associated with our TestQuest development efforts.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P46_S1	Research and development expenses represented 4% of total revenue in both 2012 and 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	Other income, net Other income consists of gains and losses we may recognize on our investments, gains or losses on foreign exchange transactions, interest income on our cash, cash equivalents and investments and other items.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	Other income was $103,000 in 2012 compared to $422,000 in 2011, representing a decline of $319,000.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P47_S2	This decrease was primarily due to a $104,000 realized gain on the sale of an auction rate security ( ARS ) investment in 2011 and the settlement of a lawsuit with our former broker dealer of our ARS investments which resulted in a gain of $213,000 in 2011, compared to no such similar items in 2012.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P47_S3	Income tax Our income tax expense was $366,000 in 2012 compared to an income tax benefit of $166,000 in 2011, a change of $532,000.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P47_S4	The increase in expense was driven by the profitability of our United States parent company in 2012.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P47_S5	Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2012, we had $20.6 million of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash, compared to $19.0 million at December 31, 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P47_S6	The increase was driven by our net income and non-cash expenses offset in part by negative working capital changes.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P47_S7	Restricted cash is classified as long term and was $875,000 at both December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P47_S8	This cash is restricted under the terms of our headquarters operating lease which will continue to secure that obligation through its expiration in 2014.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P47_S9	Our working capital was $20.6 million at December 31, 2012, compared to $18.0 million at December 31, 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P47_S10	Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.5 million in 2012 driven by net income of $916,000 and non cash expenses of $2.2 million, offset in part by net negative working capital changes.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P47_S11	Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.1 million in 2011 driven by $3.1 million of non-cash expenses and a $518,000 impairment charge on our intangible assets associated with TestQuest acquired technology offset, in part, by net negative working capital changes.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P47_S12	Net cash used by investing activities was $1.2 million in 2012 driven primarily by capital expenditures.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P47_S13	Net cash used by investing activities was $3.6 million in 2011 driven by the acquisition of MPC for $4.8 million in cash, net of cash acquired and $785,000 of capital expenditures, offset in part by net maturities of short-term investments.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P47_S14	Financing activities generated cash of $205,000 in 2012 and $424,000 in 2011 as a result of employees exercise of stock options.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P47_S15	We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments will be sufficient to meet our needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P47_S16	Cash Commitments We have the following future or potential cash commitments:
1054721_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	Under the terms of our corporate headquarters lease signed in February 2004, the landlord has the ability to demand payment for cash payments forgiven in 2004 if we default under the lease.
1054721_13_ITEM7_P48_S1	The amount of the forgiven payments for which the landlord can demand repayment was $400,000 at December 31, 2012, and decreases on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the lease, which expires in 2014.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BSQUARE Corporation (the Corporation ) as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, shareholders equity and cash flows for the years then ended.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P0_S1	These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation s management.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P0_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P0_S3	We conducted our audits in accordance with the auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1054721_13_ITEM8_P0_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P0_S5	The Corporation is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P0_S6	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P0_S7	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P1_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P1_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P1_S2	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of BSQUARE Corporation as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1054721_13_ITEM8_P8_S2	In the case of enterprises, our customers include those which develop, market and distribute smart devices on their own behalf as well as those that purchase devices from OEMs or ODMs and require additional device software or testing.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P8_S3	The software solutions we provide are utilized and deployed throughout various phases of our customers device life cycle, including design, development, customization, quality assurance and deployment.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P9_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of BSQUARE Corporation and our wholly owned subsidiaries.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P9_S1	All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P10_S0	Use of Estimates Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P10_S1	Examples include provisions for bad debts and income taxes, estimates of progress on professional engineering service arrangements, bonus accruals, fair value of intangible assets and property and equipment, fair values of stock-based awards and the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities, among other estimates.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P10_S2	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P11_S0	Basic income or loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, and excludes any dilutive effects of common stock equivalent shares, such as options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and warrants.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P11_S1	Restricted stock awards ( RSAs ) are considered outstanding and included in the computation of basic income or loss per share when underlying restrictions expire and the awards are no longer forfeitable.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P11_S2	Restricted stock units ( RSUs ), which vest over a period of one to four years, are considered outstanding and included in the computation of basic income or loss per share only when vested.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P12_S0	Common stock equivalent shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is anti-dilutive.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P12_S1	Unvested but outstanding RSUs and RSAs which are forfeitable but outstanding are included in the diluted income per share calculation.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P13_S0	The following table presents a reconciliation of the number of shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted income (loss) per share (in thousands):
1054721_13_ITEM8_P14_S0	Had we not been in a net loss position in 2011, our weighted average shares used to calculate diluted income per share would have been 11,419,000, representing a dilutive effect of common stock equivalents of 825,000 shares.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P15_S0	We invest our excess cash primarily in highly liquid debt instruments of U.S. government agencies and municipalities, debt instruments issued by foreign government, corporate commercial paper, money market funds, and corporate debt securities.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P15_S1	We classify all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months as short-term investments.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P15_S2	Short-term investments consist entirely of marketable securities which are all classified as available-for-sale securities and are recorded at their estimated fair value.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P15_S3	We determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P15_S4	We may or may not hold securities with stated maturities greater than 12 months until maturity.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P15_S5	As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify securities with maturities beyond 12 months as short-term investments.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P15_S6	We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of stockholders equity, except for unrealized losses determined to be other than temporary which are recorded in other expense.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P16_S0	Restricted Cash Our restricted cash represents funds held at a financial institution as security for an outstanding letter of credit expiring in 2014 related to our corporate headquarters lease obligation.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P17_S0	Financial Instruments and Concentrations of Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts receivable.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P18_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We record accounts receivable at the invoiced amount net of an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P18_S1	We review customers which are past due to identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P18_S2	In determining the amount of the allowance, we make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P19_S0	Equipment, Furniture and Leasehold Improvements We account for equipment, furniture and leasehold improvements at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P19_S1	We compute depreciation of equipment and furniture using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three years.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P20_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful lives, ranging from 2 to 10 years.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P20_S1	Maintenance and repairs costs are expensed as incurred.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P21_S0	When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, gains or losses are included in the statement of operations.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P22_S0	When facts and circumstances indicate that the value of long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying value of the asset to projected undiscounted future cash flows.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P22_S1	Upon indication that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss as a charge against current operations based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P23_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets were recorded as a result of business acquisitions and are stated at estimated fair value at the time of acquisition less accumulated amortization.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P24_S0	We amortize our acquired intangible assets using the straight-line method using lives ranging from 1 to 10 years.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P25_S0	We review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P25_S1	We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P26_S0	If intangible assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P27_S0	Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P27_S1	We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P27_S2	If it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount, further testing of goodwill impairment is not performed.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P28_S0	If it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, we perform a quantitative two-step impairment test.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P29_S0	The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P29_S1	If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P30_S0	We record all fees payable and accrued liabilities related to the sale of third-party software, such as Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, as third-party software fees payable.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P31_S0	Research and Development Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P32_S0	Advertising Costs All costs of advertising, including cooperative marketing arrangements, are expensed as incurred.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P32_S1	Advertising expense was $733,000 in 2012 and $588,000 in 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P33_S0	The estimated fair value of stock based awards is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the award, net of estimated forfeitures.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P34_S0	historical experience and expected future activity.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P35_S0	The fair value of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P35_S1	The fair value of stock option awards are estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of each vesting tranche as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton ( BSM ) option-pricing model.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P35_S2	The BSM model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and option life.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P35_S3	If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P36_S0	Incentive Compensation We make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions regarding the likelihood of our attainment, and the level thereof, of bonuses payable under our annual incentive compensation programs.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P36_S1	We accrue bonuses and recognize the resulting expense when the bonus is judged to be reasonably likely to be earned as of year-end and is estimable.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P36_S2	The amount accrued, and expense recognized, is the estimated portion of the bonus earned on a year-to-date basis less any amounts previously accrued.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P36_S3	These estimates, judgments and assumptions are made quarterly based on available information and take into consideration our year-to-date actual results and expected results for the remainder of the year.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P36_S4	Because our attainment estimate factors estimated future results, significant judgment is required.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P36_S5	If actual results differ materially from our estimates, the amount of bonus expense recorded in a particular quarter could be significantly over or under estimated.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P37_S0	Comprehensive Income (Loss) Comprehensive income (loss) refers to net income (loss) and other revenue, expenses, gains and losses that, under generally accepted accounting principles, are recorded as an element of shareholders equity but are excluded from the calculation of net income (loss).
1054721_13_ITEM8_P38_S0	Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P38_S1	Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P39_S0	We compute income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred income taxes are provided for on the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P39_S1	Our deferred tax assets are measured using currently enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P39_S2	A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P40_S0	We recognize tax benefits from an uncertain position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based on its technical merits.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P40_S1	The tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P40_S2	Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are classified in the financial statements as income tax expense.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P41_S0	The functional currency of foreign subsidiaries is the local currency.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P41_S1	Accordingly, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P41_S2	Resulting translation adjustments are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, a separate component of shareholders equity.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P42_S0	The net gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are recorded in the period incurred and were not significant for any of the periods presented.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P43_S0	been rendered; the selling price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P44_S0	Contracts and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P44_S1	Shipping documents and time records are generally used to verify delivery.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P44_S2	We assess whether the selling price is fixed or determinable based on the contract and/or customer purchase order and payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P44_S3	We assess collectability based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer s payment history.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P44_S4	Periodically, we will begin work on engineering service engagements prior to having a signed contract and, in some cases, the contract is signed in a quarter after which service delivery costs are incurred.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P44_S5	We do not defer costs associated with such engagements before we have received a signed contract.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P44_S6	We recognize software revenue upon shipment provided that no significant obligations remain on our part, substantive acceptance conditions, if any, have been met and the other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P45_S0	Service revenue from time and materials contracts, and training service agreements, is recognized as services are performed.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P45_S1	Fixed-price service agreements, and certain time and materials service agreements with capped fee structures, are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P45_S2	We use the percentage-of-completion method of accounting because we believe it is the most accurate method to recognize revenue based on the nature and scope of these engineering service contracts; we believe it is a better measure of periodic income results than other methods and it better matches revenue recognized with the costs incurred.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P45_S3	Percentage of completion is measured based primarily on input measures such as hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P45_S4	Significant judgment is required when estimating total hours and progress to completion on these arrangements which determines the amount of revenue we recognize as well as whether a loss is recognized if one is expected to be incurred for the remainder of the project.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P46_S0	Revisions to hour and cost estimates are incorporated in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P47_S0	We also enter into arrangements in which a customer purchases a combination of software licenses, engineering services and post-contract customer support and/or maintenance ( PCS ).
1054721_13_ITEM8_P47_S1	As a result, judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting, including how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements if there are multiple elements.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P48_S0	PCS may include rights to upgrades, when and if available, telephone support, updates and enhancements.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P49_S0	When vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) of fair value exists for all elements in a multiple element arrangement, revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each of the elements.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P49_S1	VSOE of fair value is established by the price charged when the same element is sold separately.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P49_S2	Accordingly, the judgments involved in assessing the fair values of various elements of an agreement can impact the recognition of revenue in each period.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P49_S3	Changes in the allocation of the sales price between deliverables might impact the timing of revenue recognition, but would not change the total revenue recognized on the contract.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P50_S0	When elements such as software and engineering services are contained in a single arrangement, or in related arrangements with the same customer, we allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value, provided that such element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P50_S1	In the absence of fair value for a delivered element, revenue is first allocated to the fair value of the undelivered elements and then allocated to the residual delivered elements.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P50_S2	In the absence of fair value for an undelivered element, the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting, resulting in a delay of revenue recognition for the delivered elements until the undelivered elements are fulfilled.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P51_S0	When engineering services and royalties are contained in a single arrangement, we recognize revenue from engineering services as earned in accordance with the criteria above even though the effective rate per hour may be lower than typical because the customer is contractually obligated to pay royalties on their device shipments.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P51_S1	We recognize royalty revenue, classified as software revenue, when the royalty report from the customer is received or when such royalties are contractually guaranteed and the other revenue recognition criteria are met, particularly the criteria that collectability is reasonably assured.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P52_S0	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In July 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an accounting standard update that amends the accounting guidance on testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P52_S1	The amendments in this accounting standard update are intended to reduce complexity and costs by allowing an entity the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired to determine whether it should perform a quantitative impairment test.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P52_S2	The amendments also enhance the consistency of impairment testing guidance among long-lived asset categories by permitting an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to calculate the asset s fair value when testing an indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment, which is equivalent to the impairment testing requirements for other long-lived assets.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P52_S3	The amendments in this accounting standard update are effective for interim and annual impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P52_S4	The adoption is not expected to impact our financial position or results of operations.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P53_S0	Cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, long-term investments and restricted cash consist of the following (in thousands):
1054721_13_ITEM8_P54_S0	Gross unrealized gains and losses on our cash equivalents and short-term investments were not material as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P54_S1	Our restricted cash balance at December 31, 2012 and 2011 relates to a letter of credit which will continue to secure our corporate headquarters lease obligation to its expiration in 2014.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P55_S0	Fair Value Measurements We measure our cash equivalents, marketable securities, restricted cash and the earn-out liability associated with our acquisition of MPC Data Limited ( MPC ) (see note 4) at fair value.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P56_S0	Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P56_S1	As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P57_S0	fair value hierarchy is established as a basis for considering such assumptions and for inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:
1054721_13_ITEM8_P58_S0	Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P59_S0	Level 2: Directly or indirectly observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs used in models or other valuation methodologies.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P60_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P60_S1	The inputs require significant management judgment or estimation.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P61_S0	We classify our cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash within Level 1 or Level 2.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P61_S1	This is because we value these items using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs that are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including third-party pricing services, brokers and market transactions.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P61_S2	We review the pricing techniques and methodologies of the independent pricing service for Level 2 investments and believe that the policies adequately consider market activity, either based on specific transactions for the security valued or based on modeling of securities with similar credit quality, duration, yield and structure that were recently traded.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P61_S3	In 2011, we classified our acquisition consideration liability associated with MPC within Level 3 as it is valued using valuation techniques using inputs such as management s estimation of future sales.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P61_S4	Some of the inputs to these models are unobservable in the market and are significant.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P61_S5	The acquisition earn-out consideration payout of $631,000 occurred during the fourth quarter of 2012.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P61_S6	The reduction in the estimated fair value of the acquisition consideration of $135,000 in 2012 is recorded in other income in statement of operations.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P62_S0	Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in thousands):
1054721_13_ITEM8_P63_S0	An impairment charge of $518,000 was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2011 for intangible assets measured using level 3 inputs and recorded at fair value.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P63_S1	These intangible assets were associated with acquired technology (see Note 6).
1054721_13_ITEM8_P64_S0	4. Acquisition On September 11, 2011, we completed the acquisition of MPC, a United Kingdom based provider of embedded software engineering services.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P64_S1	We acquired all outstanding shares of MPC preferred and common stock in exchange for total consideration of $7.0 million, which included an earn-out with an estimated fair value of $810,000 on the acquisition date.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P64_S2	The actual amount of the payout was $631,000 which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2012.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P64_S3	We also acquired $1.5 million in cash and cash equivalents as part of the acquisition, for a net estimated total cash price at acquisition of $5.5 million.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P64_S4	In connection with the business combination, we incurred merger-related costs, including legal, consulting, accounting and other costs, of $193,000 during 2011 which we recognized as expense.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P65_S0	The business combination was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date measured at their fair values, including intangible assets acquired consisting of trade names and trademarks, non-compete agreements, and customer relationships.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P65_S1	The acquisition of MPC was structured as a stock purchase and therefore the values assigned to the intangible assets and goodwill are not deductible for tax purposes.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P65_S2	Deferred tax liabilities of $233,000 were recognized as part of the transaction.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P65_S3	The excess of the acquisition consideration, including the estimated fair value of the earn-out, over the fair value of net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P66_S0	allocation of the acquisition consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was as follows (in thousands):
1054721_13_ITEM8_P67_S0	Of the intangible assets acquired, customer relationships have a weighted-average useful life of 10 years, non-compete agreements have a weighted-average useful life of 2 years, and trade names and trademarks have a weighted-average useful life of 1 year.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P67_S1	The unaudited pro forma results of operations are being furnished solely for informational purposes and are not intended to represent or be indicative of the consolidated results of operations that we would have reported had the MPC acquisition been completed as of the dates and for the periods presented, nor are they necessarily indicative of future results.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P67_S2	The unaudited pro forma results of operations data are derived from our consolidated financial statements and MPC and include pro forma adjustments relating to the MPC acquisition that are of a recurring nature representing pro forma amortization of intangible assets.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P67_S3	Included in the 2011 pro forma results are revenue of $1.4 million and net income of $96,000 related to MPC since the date of acquisition.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P67_S4	The pro forma results were adjusted to assume all of acquisition expenses directly related to MPC were incurred on January 1, 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P67_S5	These pro forma results of operations do not give effect to any cost savings, revenue synergies, integration or restructuring costs.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P67_S6	The unaudited pro forma combined condensed results of operations are presented below as if the MPC acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2011 (in thousands, except per share amounts):
1054721_13_ITEM8_P68_S0	Equipment, furniture, and leasehold improvements consist of the following (in thousands):
1054721_13_ITEM8_P69_S0	Depreciation and amortization expense of equipment, furniture and leasehold improvements was $672,000 in 2012 and $502,000 in 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P70_S0	Goodwill and Intangible Assets There were no changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P71_S0	Intangible assets relate to developed technology, trade names and trademarks, customer relationships, and non-compete agreements that we acquired from TestQuest in November 2008 and through the acquisition of MPC in September 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P71_S1	In the fourth quarter of 2011, we recognized a $518,000 impairment charge as software cost of revenue related to the acquired technology from TestQuest in 2008.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P71_S2	The intangible asset associated with the acquired technology was deemed to be impaired as this technology is no longer used in any of our product offerings.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P71_S3	Information regarding our acquisition-related intangible assets is as follows (in thousands):
1054721_13_ITEM8_P72_S0	Amortization expense was $321,000 and $417,000 for 2012 and 2011, respectively.

1054721_13_ITEM8_P77_S0	Our net deferred tax assets are recorded as follows (in thousands):
1054721_13_ITEM8_P78_S0	The provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the applicable U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to pre-tax income, as a result of the following:
1054721_13_ITEM8_P79_S0	At December 31, 2012, we had approximately $57.0 million of federal and $12.1 million of state net operating loss carryforwards, which have begun to expire including $4.8 million of state losses in 2012.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P79_S1	Of the federal net operating loss carryforwards, $42.6 million will expire in 2022 and 2023.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P79_S2	We also have $2.5 million of tax credit carryforwards, which begin to expire in 2022.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P79_S3	Utilization of these carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation due to Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code which restricts the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use its carryforwards.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P80_S0	ownership change occurs if greater than five percent shareholders of an issuer s outstanding common stock, collectively, increase their ownership percentage by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P80_S1	We have performed analyses of possible ownership changes in the past, which included consideration of a third-party study, and do not believe that an ownership change of more than 50 percentage points has occurred.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P80_S2	We have evaluated all the material income tax positions taken on the Company s income tax filings to various tax authorities, and we determined that we did not have unrealized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions recorded at December 31, 2012 or 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P80_S3	Because of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, substantially all of our tax years remain open and subject to examination.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P81_S0	Our principal commitments consist of obligations outstanding under operating leases, which expire through 2018.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P81_S1	We have lease commitments for office space in Bellevue, Washington; San Diego, California; Taipei, Taiwan; Beijing, China; Seoul, Korea; Tokyo, Japan; Munich, Germany; and Trowbridge, United Kingdom.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P81_S2	We also lease office space in Akron, Ohio and Boston, Massachusetts on a month-to-month basis.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P82_S0	Under the terms of our corporate headquarters lease signed in February 2004, if we default under the lease, the landlord has the ability to demand payment for cash payments forgiven in 2004.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P82_S1	The amount of the forgiven payments for which the landlord can demand repayment was $400,000 at December 31, 2012.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P82_S2	Rent expense was $1.8 million in 2012 and $1.6 million in 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P82_S3	As of December 31, 2012, we had $875,000 pledged as collateral for a bank letter of credit under the terms of our headquarters facility lease.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P82_S4	The pledged cash supporting the outstanding letter of credit is recorded as restricted cash.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P82_S5	Operating lease commitments at December 31, 2012 are as follows (in thousands):
1054721_13_ITEM8_P83_S0	Volume Pricing Agreements In conjunction with our activities under the OEM Distribution Agreements ( ODAs ) with Microsoft, we enter into OEM Volume Royalty Pricing ( OVRP ) commitments with Microsoft.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P83_S1	Under these OVRPs, we are provided with volume pricing on a customer-by-customer basis assuming certain minimum unit volumes are met.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P83_S2	The OVRP terms are 12 months.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P83_S3	In the event we don t meet the committed minimum unit volumes, we are obligated to pay the difference between the committed per-unit volume rate and the actual per-unit rate we achieved based upon actual units purchased.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P83_S4	The OVRP arrangements do not equate to a minimum purchase commitment but rather, the arrangements are a volume pricing arrangement based upon actual volume purchased.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P84_S0	However, in the event a customer is unwilling or unable to pay us, we would be negatively impacted.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P84_S1	Based upon the credit-worthiness of our customers, our historical OVRP experience with our customers and OVRP arrangements in general, we do not believe we will incur any material liability in the current or future periods and therefore no provision or reserve has been recorded as of December 31, 2012 or 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P85_S0	Shareholders Equity Equity Compensation Plans We have a stock plan (the Stock Plan ) and an inducement stock plan for newly hired employees (the Inducement Plan ) (collectively the Plans ).
1054721_13_ITEM8_P85_S1	Under the Plans, stock options may be granted with a fixed exercise price that is equivalent to fair market value on the date of grant.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P85_S2	These options have a term of up to 10 years and vest over a predetermined period, generally four years.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P85_S3	Incentive stock options granted under the Stock Plan may only be granted to our employees.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P85_S4	The Plans also allow for awards of non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSAs and unrestricted stock awards, and RSUs.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P85_S5	The Inducement Plan was established in connection with the MPC acquisition and 250,000 shares have been allocated for award under the Inducement Plan.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P85_S6	The number of shares available for award may be modified by our Board of Directors, subject to SEC and NASDAQ limitations.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P85_S7	There were grants of options to purchase 211,450 shares of our common stock under the Inducement Plan during 2012.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P86_S0	The estimated fair value of stock-based awards is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the award, net of estimated forfeitures.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P87_S0	We estimate forfeitures of stock based awards based on historical experience and expected future activity.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P88_S0	The fair value of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P88_S1	The fair value of stock option awards are estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of each vesting tranche as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton ( BSM ) option-pricing model.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P88_S2	The BSM model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and option life.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P88_S3	If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P89_S0	The fair values of our equity awards, primarily stock option grants, were estimated with the following weighted average assumptions:
1054721_13_ITEM8_P90_S0	The impact on our results of operations of recording stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):
1054721_13_ITEM8_P91_S0	The following table summarizes stock option activity under the Plans for 2012 and 2011:
1054721_13_ITEM8_P92_S0	At December 31, 2012, total compensation cost related to stock options granted to employees under the Plans but not yet recognized was $352,000, net of estimated forfeitures.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P92_S1	This cost will be amortized on the straight-line method over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.5 years.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P93_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the quoted price of our common stock for the number of options that were in-the-money at year end.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P94_S0	We issue new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P94_S1	The following table summarizes certain information about stock options for 2012 and 2011:
1054721_13_ITEM8_P95_S0	The following table summarizes restricted stock award activity under the Stock Plan for 2012 and 2011:
1054721_13_ITEM8_P96_S0	The following table summarizes restricted stock unit activity under the Stock Plan for 2012 and 2011:
1054721_13_ITEM8_P97_S0	At December 31, 2012, total compensation cost related to restricted stock units granted under the Stock Plan but not yet recognized was $795,000 net of estimated forfeitures.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P97_S1	This cost will be amortized on the straight-line method over a period of approximately 2 years.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P97_S2	Common Stock Reserved for Future Issuance The following table summarizes our shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under the Plans at December 31, 2012 and 2011:
1054721_13_ITEM8_P98_S0	We have a Profit Sharing and Deferred Compensation Plan ( Profit Sharing Plan ) under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P98_S1	Substantially all full-time employees are eligible to participate in the Profit Sharing Plan.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P98_S2	We typically elect to match the participants contributions to the Profit Sharing Plan up to a certain amount.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P98_S3	Participants will receive their share of the value of their investments, and any applicable vested match, upon retirement or termination.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P98_S4	We made matching contributions of $346,000 in 2012 and $440,000 in 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P99_S0	Significant Risk Concentrations Significant Customer No customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue in 2012.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P100_S0	Ford Motor Company ( Ford ) accounted for $9.7 million, or 10% of total revenue, in 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P100_S1	Bluebird Soft, Inc. ( Bluebird ), a designer and manufacturer of handheld mobile devices, had an accounts receivable balance of $2.1 million, or 13% of total accounts receivable, as of December 31, 2012.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P100_S2	Ford had an accounts receivable balance of $1.6 million, or 12% of total accounts receivable, as of December 31, 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P100_S3	No other customer accounted for 10% or more of total accounts receivable at December 31, 2012 or 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P101_S0	We have OEM Distribution Agreements ( ODAs ) with Microsoft Corporation ( Microsoft ) which enable us to sell Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems to our customers in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean (excluding Cuba), Mexico, the European Union and the European Free Trade Association, which expire on June 30, 2013.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P101_S1	We also have ODAs with Microsoft which allow us to sell Microsoft Windows Mobile operating systems in the Americas, Japan, Taiwan, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P101_S2	Our current distribution agreements related to Windows Mobile expire in June 2014 with the exception of EMEA which expired on December 31, 2012 but which we expect to be renewed shortly.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P101_S3	Our rights to distribute Windows Mobile operating systems in Korea ended on October 31, 2012.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P101_S4	We sold $4.5 million of Windows Mobile operating systems in Korea in 2012 and $4.6 million in 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P101_S5	Software sales under these agreements constitute a significant portion of our software revenue and total revenue.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P101_S6	These agreements are typically renewed annually or semi-annually; however there is no automatic renewal provision in any of these agreements.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P101_S7	Further, these agreements can be terminated unilaterally by Microsoft at any time.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P102_S0	Microsoft currently offers a rebate program to sell Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems in which we earn money for achieving certain predefined objectives.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P102_S1	Under this rebate program we earned $888,000 in 2012 and $746,000 in 2011.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P102_S2	These rebates are accounted for as a reduction in software cost of revenue.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P103_S0	Information about Geographic Areas Our chief operating decision-makers (i.e., chief executive officer, and certain of his direct reports) review financial information presented on a consolidated basis, accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues by geographic region for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P103_S1	There are no segment managers who are held accountable by our chief operating decision-makers, or anyone else, for operations, operating results, and planning for levels or components below the consolidated unit level.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P103_S2	Accordingly, we consider ourselves to be in a single reporting segment and operating unit structure.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P104_S0	Revenues by geography are based on the billing address of the customer.
1054721_13_ITEM8_P104_S1	The following table sets forth revenue and long-lived assets by geographic area (in thousands):
1054721_13_ITEM8_P105_S0	Following is a summary of unaudited quarterly financial information for 2012 and 2011:
1054721_13_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1054721_13_ITEM9A_P0_S1	In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our CEO and CFO, as of December 31, 2012, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.
1054721_13_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based upon this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2012.
1054721_13_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
1054721_13_ITEM9A_P0_S4	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1054721_13_ITEM9A_P0_S5	Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act and includes those policies and procedures that: (a) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (b) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (c) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
1054721_13_ITEM9A_P0_S6	All internal controls, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
1054721_13_ITEM9A_P0_S7	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
1054721_13_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012.
1054721_13_ITEM9A_P1_S1	In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in Internal Control Integrated Framework .
1054721_13_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on its assessment, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2012, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.
1054721_13_ITEM9A_P1_S3	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our fourth quarter of 2012 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

1054721_14_ITEM1_P0_S0	this Item regarding compliance by our directors, executive officers and holders of ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is included in our definitive proxy statement for our 2014 annual meeting of shareholders to be filed with the SEC under the caption Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance and is incorporated herein by this reference.
1054721_14_ITEM1_P0_S1	The remaining information required by this Item is included in our definitive proxy statement for our 2014 annual meeting of shareholders to be filed with the SEC under the caption Corporate Governance and is incorporated herein by this reference.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and the trading price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Microsoft-Related Risk Factors Due to the fact that we provide software and services to customers building devices utilizing Microsoft s Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, as well as the fact that a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, Microsoft has a significant direct and indirect influence on our business.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P1_S3	The following Microsoft-related risk factors may negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	If we do not maintain our OEM Distribution Agreements with Microsoft or if Microsoft de-emphasizes or divests itself from these areas of its business, our revenue would decrease and our business would be adversely affected.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We have OEM Distribution Agreements ( ODA s) for Software Products for Embedded Systems with Microsoft, which enable us to sell various Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems to our customers in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean (excluding Cuba), Mexico, the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	These ODAs are effective through June 30, 2014.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We have also entered into other ODAs with Microsoft pursuant to which we are licensed to sell Microsoft Windows Mobile operating systems to customers in North America, South America, Central America, Japan, Taiwan, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P3_S3	The ODAs to sell Windows Mobile operating systems are effective through June 30, 2014.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P3_S4	We generated $64.0 million and $67.0 million of revenue in 2013 and 2012, respectively, through our sales of Microsoft operating systems and expect this revenue stream to continue in 2014.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Our rights to distribute Windows Mobile operating systems in Korea expired on October 31, 2012.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P3_S6	We sold $4.5 million of Windows Mobile operating systems in Korea in 2012.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	If any of the ODAs are terminated by Microsoft (which Microsoft can do unilaterally) or not renewed, or if Microsoft decides to no longer invest in or to divest itself from these areas of its business, our software revenue and resulting gross profit could decrease significantly and our operating results would be negatively impacted.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Future renewals, if any, could be on less favorable terms, which could also negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Microsoft can change pricing under the ODAs at any time and unless we are able to either pass through price increases to our customers or sign our customers to 12-month purchasing commitments, which lowers the price we pay to Microsoft, our revenue, gross profit and operating results would be negatively impacted.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Further, Microsoft currently offers a rebate program in conjunction with our ODA activities in which we earn money for achieving certain predefined objectives.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P4_S4	If Microsoft were to eliminate or negatively modify the rebate program, our gross profit and operating results would be negatively impacted.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P4_S5	We earned rebate credits from Microsoft of $1.2 million and $888,000 in 2013 and 2012, respectively, a portion of which is accounted for as a reduction in cost of sales and a portion as a reduction in marketing expense if and when qualified expenditures are made.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P4_S6	Microsoft has audited our records under the ODAs in the past and will likely audit our records again in the future and any negative audit results could result in additional charges and/or the termination of the ODAs.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	There are provisions in the ODAs that require us to maintain certain internal records and processes for auditing and other reasons.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Non-compliance with these and other requirements could result in the termination of the ODAs.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Microsoft has concluded audits of our records pertaining to the ODAs in 2009 and 2006, neither of which had material findings.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	It is possible that future audits could result in charges due to any material findings that are found.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	If we are invoiced by Microsoft for a pricing adjustments under OVRP arrangements and we are unable to pass through the charge to our customers, our operating results and cash flow would be negatively impacted.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	In conjunction with our activities under the ODAs with Microsoft, we enter into OEM Volume Royalty Program ( OVRP ) commitments with Microsoft.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Under these OVRPs, we are provided with volume pricing on a customer-by-customer basis assuming certain minimum unit volumes are met.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	The OVRP terms are 12 months.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P7_S3	In the event we don t meet the committed minimum unit volumes, we are obligated to pay the difference between the committed per-unit volume rate and the actual per-unit rate we achieved based upon actual units purchased.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P7_S4	The OVRP arrangements do not equate to a minimum purchase commitment but rather the arrangements are a volume pricing arrangement based upon actual volume purchased.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P7_S5	In substantially all instances, we have reciprocal agreements with our customers such that we will receive per-unit price adjustments, similar to the amounts we would subsequently owe to Microsoft if such OVRP volumes are not met.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	those that have, we have been able to pass through the price adjustment to our customer, in the event the customer is unwilling or unable to pay us, our operating results and cash flow would be negatively impacted.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	If we do not maintain our favorable relationship with Microsoft, we will have difficulty marketing and selling our software and services and may not receive developer releases of Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	As a result, our revenue and operating results could suffer.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P8_S3	We maintain a strategic marketing relationship with Microsoft.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P8_S4	If our relationship with Microsoft deteriorates for any reason, including an increased focus by us on customers building devices utilizing non-Microsoft operating systems, our efforts to market and sell our software and services to our customers could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Microsoft has significant influence over the development plans and buying decisions of customers utilizing the various Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Microsoft provides customer referrals to us.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Moreover, Microsoft controls the marketing campaigns related to its operating systems.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Microsoft s marketing activities, including trade shows, direct mail campaigns and print advertising, are important to the continued promotion and market acceptance of Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems and, consequently, to our sale of Windows-based software and services.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P9_S4	We must maintain a favorable relationship with Microsoft to continue to participate in joint marketing activities with them, which includes participating in partner pavilions at trade shows, listing our services on Microsoft s website, and receiving customer referrals.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P9_S5	In the event that we are unable to continue our joint marketing efforts with Microsoft, or fail to receive referrals from them, we would be required to devote significant additional resources and incur additional expenses to market our software products and services directly to potential customers.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P9_S6	In addition, we depend on Microsoft for developer releases of new versions of, and upgrades to, its Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile software in order to facilitate timely development and delivery of our own software and services.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P9_S7	If we are unable to maintain our favorable relationship with Microsoft and no longer continue receiving such new versions and updates, our revenue could decline significantly, and/or our costs could increase significantly, thereby negatively impacting our operating results.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P9_S8	Unexpected delays or announcement of delays by Microsoft related to product releases of Windows Embedded or Windows Mobile operating systems could adversely affect our revenue and operating results.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P9_S9	Unexpected delays or announcement of delays in Microsoft s delivery schedule for new versions of Windows Embedded or Windows Mobile operating systems could cause us to delay our product introductions or impede our ability to sell our products and services and/or to complete customer projects on a timely basis.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P9_S10	Such delays or announcements of delays by Microsoft could also cause our customers to delay or cancel their project development activities or product introductions, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P9_S11	If Microsoft adds features to its Windows operating systems or develops products that directly compete with products and services we provide, our revenue and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P9_S12	As the developer of Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, Microsoft could add features which eliminate or reduce our customers need for our software and services, or Microsoft could develop standalone products and services that compete with the products and services we provide to our customers.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P9_S13	The ability of our customers, or potential customers, to obtain products and services directly from Microsoft that compete with our products and services could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P9_S14	Even if the standard features of future Microsoft operating system software were more limited than our offerings, a significant number of our customers, and potential customers, might elect to accept more limited functionality in lieu of purchasing additional software from us or delay the purchase of our products and services while they perform a comparison of Microsoft s competing offerings.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P9_S15	Moreover, the resulting competitive pressures could lead to price reductions for our offerings and reduce our revenue and gross profit accordingly and our operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	If the markets for Windows Embedded and/or Windows Mobile operating systems fail to develop further, develop more slowly than expected, or decline, our business and operating results may be materially harmed.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Because a significant portion of our revenue to date has been generated by software and services targeted at customers and devices utilizing the various Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, if the markets for these systems or platforms fail to develop further, or develop more slowly than expected, or decline, our business and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Market acceptance of Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems will depend on many factors, including:
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Microsoft s development and support of various Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile markets.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	In Motion Limited ( RIM and other proprietary operating systems.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The willingness of software developers to continue to develop and expand the applications that run on Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	To the extent that software developers write applications for competing operating systems that are more attractive to users than those available on Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, this could cause potential customers to select competing operating systems.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	MyFord Touch-Related Risk Factors If we do not obtain additional work on the MyFord Touch program, our future revenue and gross profit would decrease and our operating results would be adversely affected.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We began working on the MyFord Touch infotainment project with Ford in the second quarter of 2008 and continue to work on the program.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Since inception of the program through December 31, 2011, our contractual relationship was with Ford.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Effective January 1, 2012, our contractual relationship for the MyFord Touch program shifted from Ford to Microsoft, as Microsoft has become the primary vendor to Ford for this program.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Revenue from the MyFord Touch program comprised $4.5 million, or 5%, of our total revenue, in 2013, and $6.4 million, or 6%, of our total revenue in 2012.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P14_S5	We currently expect this project work to continue in 2014 but expect revenue from the MyFord Touch program to be lower, albeit still significant in 2014, than it was in 2013 due to the lower level of personnel resources utilized on the program.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Our statement of work with Microsoft currently runs through June 30, 2014.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P14_S7	While we expect to be actively involved in future projects with Microsoft and Ford beyond June 30, 2014, if our role on MyFord Touch is scaled back or eliminated beyond that point our revenue and resulting gross profit would suffer and negatively impact our operating results.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	General Business-Related Risk Factors Our marketplace is extremely competitive, which may result in price reductions, lower gross profit margins and loss of market share.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The market for device software and services is extremely competitive.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We face competition from the following:
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Mobile and embedded test automation providers including Perfecto Mobile, mVerify, JAMO Solutions, SmartBear Software (AutomatedQA), TestPlant (eggPlant) and Keynote.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating system distributors such as Arrow Electronics, Inc.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We will encounter increasing competition in the growing Internet of Things market from a number of additional software and service providers as we expand our focus on this market in 2014 and beyond.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Some of our competitors focus on only one aspect of our business or offer complementary products which can be integrated with our products.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P19_S2	As we develop and bring to market new software products and service offerings, we may begin competing with companies with which we have not previously competed.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Further, as we expand the geographic markets into which we sell our software solutions and related services, or increase our penetration therein, we may expect to increasingly compete with companies with which we have not previously competed.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P19_S4	It is also possible that new competitors will enter the market or that our competitors will form alliances, including alliances with Microsoft, that may enable them to rapidly increase their market share.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Microsoft has not agreed to any exclusive arrangement with us, nor has it agreed not to compete with us.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P19_S6	Microsoft may decide to bring more of the core embedded development services and expertise that we provide in-house, possibly resulting in reduced software and service revenue opportunities for us.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The barrier to entering the market as a provider of Microsoft-based smart connected system software and services is low.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	In addition, Microsoft has created marketing programs to encourage systems integrators to work on Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating system software and services.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P20_S2	These systems integrators are given substantially the same access by Microsoft to the Microsoft technology as we are.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P20_S3	New competitors may have lower overhead than we do and may be able to undercut our pricing.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P20_S4	We expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter the connected device market, and as new products and technologies are introduced.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Expected operating efficiencies from our restructuring plans may not be realized as anticipated.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P20_S6	In the fourth quarter of 2013, we effected a restructuring that included a workforce reduction and the closure of our offices in Beijing, China and Munich, Germany.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P20_S7	The restructuring was intended to reduce expenses, both service and proprietary software cost of sales and all areas of operating expenses, by approximately $4 million annually and better align our organizational structure with our strategic focus.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	negative impact on sales and customer service as well as factors outside of our control such as changes in the economic environment.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We cannot be certain that the anticipated benefits will be realized under our restructuring plans, which could result in further restructuring efforts.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P21_S2	If our restructuring plans are not successful, our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Management turnover creates uncertainties and could harm our business.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P21_S4	We had significant changes in executive leadership during 2013 and more could occur.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Jerry Chase was appointed as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company in February 2014.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P21_S6	Mr. Chase joined our Board of Directors in July 2013 and had served as our interim Chief Executive Officer since September 23, 2013, after Brian Crowley stepped down as President and Chief Executive Officer and from the Board of Directors.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P21_S7	In October 2013, John Traynor, Senior Vice-President, Products left the company as part of the restructuring.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P21_S8	In addition, Mike Stipe, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Sales and Marketing departed in December 2013.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P21_S9	At that time, Mark Whiteside, Senior Vice President, Professional Services took on the additional role of Senior Vice President of US Solutions and International Sales.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Changes to strategic or operating goals, which can often times occur with the appointment of new executives, can create uncertainty, may negatively impact our ability to execute quickly and effectively, and may ultimately be unsuccessful.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	In addition, executive leadership transition periods are often difficult as the new executives gain detailed knowledge of our operations, and friction can result from changes in strategy and management style.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Management turnover inherently causes some loss of institutional knowledge, which can negatively affect strategy and execution.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Until we integrate new personnel, and unless they are able to succeed in their positions, we may be unable to successfully manage and grow our business, and our financial condition and profitability may suffer.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Further, to the extent we experience additional management turnover, competition for top management is high and it may take months to find a candidate that meets our requirements.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P23_S3	If we are unable to attract and retain qualified management personnel, our business could suffer.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Our ability to maintain or grow our proprietary software revenue is contingent on our ability to bring to market competitive, unique offerings that keep pace with technological changes and needs.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P23_S5	If we are not successful in doing so, our business would be negatively impacted.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Proprietary software product revenue provides us with much higher gross profit margins than we typically receive from third-party software products and our engineering service offerings and provide other advantages as well.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Increasing the number and amount of proprietary products we sell is an important part of our growth strategy.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Our ability to maintain and increase the revenue contribution from proprietary software products is contingent on our ability to enhance the features and functionality of our current proprietary products as well as to devise, develop and introduce new products.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P24_S3	There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or expand the number of proprietary products that we sell, and our failure to do so could negatively impact revenue and our operating results.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P24_S4	We may experience delays in our efforts to develop new products and services, and these delays could cause us to miss market opportunities which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The market for our software and services evolves rapidly.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P25_S1	As a result, the life cycles of our products and services are difficult to estimate.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P25_S2	To be successful, we believe we must continue to enhance our current offerings and provide new software and service offerings with attractive features, prices and terms that appeal to our customers.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P25_S3	We have experienced delays in new software and service offering introductions in the past and may do so again in the future.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Our revenue and operating results may be negatively impacted if we delay releases of new products, product enhancements and/or new services offerings, or if we fail to accurately anticipate our customers needs or technical trends and are unable to introduce new products and service offerings into the market successfully.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P25_S5	In addition, our customers may defer or forego purchases of our products and/or services if we, Microsoft, our competitors or major hardware, systems or software vendors introduce or announce new products.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our future success depends upon our customers ability to successfully sell their products incorporating our technology, and to continue buying our services.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Even if a customer selects us to provide software and services, the customer may not ultimately market and sell its product successfully.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P26_S2	A cancellation or change in plans by a customer, whether from lack of market acceptance of its products or otherwise, could cause us to lose revenue that we had anticipated and our revenue and operating results would suffer.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Also, our revenue and operating results could suffer if a significant customer reduces or delays orders during our sales cycle or chooses not to release products that contain our technology.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P26_S4	If the market for smart, connected systems evolves based on technologies that we do not support, our revenue may not grow as anticipated, if at all, and our business would be harmed.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The technologies used in smart, connected systems change very rapidly and it is often difficult to foresee and predict which application processors, operating systems, connectivity, testing and application development technologies will gain a foothold in device development.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	As a smaller company we can invest our resources in a limited number of technologies and as such must make forward investments in developing products and capabilities to support the technologies that we choose.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P27_S2	If we make investments in technologies that do not gain traction in device development, our profit potential is uncertain and our revenue may not develop as anticipated.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P27_S3	We are dependent upon the broad acceptance and adoption by businesses and consumers of a wide variety of device technologies, which will depend on many factors, including:
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The amount of discretionary funds companies and individuals have to spend for the latest technologies.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The success and profitability of our service offerings are contingent on our ability to differentiate these offerings adequately in the marketplace, which is, in turn, contingent on our ability to retain our engineering personnel and defend our billing rate structure against those of our competitors, including those using significant lower-cost offshore resources.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P28_S2	If we are unable to do so successfully, our business could be harmed.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P28_S3	We are a leader in providing engineering services to customers developing smart devices.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Our market differentiation is created through several factors, including our experience with a variety of smart connected system platforms and applications.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Our differentiation is contingent, in part, on our ability to attract and retain employees with this expertise, a significant portion of which are currently based in the United States.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P28_S6	To the extent we are unable to retain critical engineering services talent and/or our competition is able to deliver the same services by using significant lower-cost offshore resources, our service revenue and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P28_S7	The success and profitability of our service engagements are contingent upon our ability to scope and bid engagements and deliver our services profitably.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P28_S8	If we are unable to do so, our service revenue service gross profit margin and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Various factors may cause the total cost of service projects to exceed the original estimate provided to the customer or the contractual maximum in the case of fixed price contracts, including specification changes, customer deliverable delays, inadequate scoping and inefficient service delivery.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	If we are unable to adequately scope, bid and deliver on service engagements successfully, our service revenue, service gross margin and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P29_S2	In addition, depending on the cause of an overrun for a given customer and project, we may also decide to provide pricing concessions to that customer which could negatively impact our service revenue, service gross profit and operating results.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We have periodically entered into engineering service agreements in which we have agreed to perform our engineering service work for lower up-front fees, or for no fees, in exchange for future royalties or per unit fees.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P30_S1	There is no guarantee that these arrangements will produce the strategic or economic returns as anticipated.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P30_S2	We have entered into contracts that involve reducing or eliminating up-front engineering service fees in return for a per-device/chip royalty or fee that is earned as our customers ship their devices or chips, and we may enter into more such agreements in the future.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Because we are delaying revenue past the point where our services are performed, there is a risk that our customers may cancel their projects or that their devices or chips may not be successful in the market, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Cooperation and support from silicon vendors is critical for the success of our products and related services that are developed for their particular silicon architecture.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P30_S5	We have developed, and continue to develop, software and service offerings based on certain silicon architectures.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P30_S6	Due to the nature of the industry we serve and the products we develop, it is necessary for us to make certain assumptions regarding which silicon vendors will be successful in the various markets we serve and upon which we are making investments.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P30_S7	It is therefore important that there is ongoing support from the SVs in the marketplace for these silicon architectures.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P30_S8	There can be no assurance that TI, Qualcomm, Freescale, Intel or any of the other SVs will continue to pursue and support the markets that we have been targeting.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P30_S9	If the SVs do not support our efforts going forward, our revenue and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P30_S10	The long sales cycle of our products and services makes our revenue susceptible to fluctuations.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P30_S11	Our sales cycle is typically three to nine months because the expense and complexity of the software and service offerings we sell generally require a lengthy customer approval process and may be subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control, including:
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	The timing of customers competitive evaluation processes.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	In addition, to successfully sell our software and engineering service offerings, we must frequently educate our potential customers about the full benefits of our software and services, which can require significant time.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P31_S2	If our sales cycle further lengthens unexpectedly, it could adversely affect the timing of our revenue, which could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Erosion of the financial condition of our customers could adversely affect our business.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Our business could be adversely affected if the financial condition of our customers erodes because such erosion could reduce demand from those customers for our software and engineering services.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P31_S5	This could also cause them to terminate their relationships with us, and/or could increase the risk that such customers default on their payment obligations to us.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P31_S6	Additionally, while we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate, economic trends may cause more companies to default or cease operations, in which case our allowances may not cover actual losses, which could adversely affect our operating results.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P31_S7	Our business and operations would be adversely impacted in the event of a failure or interruption of our information technology infrastructure.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P31_S8	The proper functioning of our information technology infrastructure is critical to the efficient operation and management of our business.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	worms and other malicious software programs, physical and electronic break-ins, sabotage and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P32_S1	We believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology infrastructure and our operations from these information technology-related and other potential disruptions.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P32_S2	However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P32_S3	We may be subject to product liability claims that could result in significant costs.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P32_S4	Our software license and service agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P32_S5	It is possible, however, that these provisions may be ineffective under the laws of certain jurisdictions or that our customers may not agree to these limitations.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P32_S6	Although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date, the sale and support of our products and services may be subject to such claims in the future.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P32_S7	There is a risk that any such claims or liabilities may exceed, or fall outside, the scope of our insurance coverage, and we may be unable to retain adequate liability insurance in the future.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P32_S8	A product liability claim brought against us, whether successful or not, could negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P32_S9	Negative business conditions, changes in useful lives, and other factors may negatively affect the carrying value of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P32_S10	In the third quarter of 2011, we acquired MPC Data, Ltd. including certain intangible assets with a carrying value of $758,000 and goodwill of $3.7 million as of December 31, 2013.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P32_S11	Although we expect to generate cash from the intangible assets in the future, and do not foresee any impairment of our goodwill, it is possible that we may be required to reassess the carrying value of these assets in the future if certain negative business conditions occur such as negative results of our business associated with our intangible assets or a low stock price.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P32_S12	Any reduction in the carrying value of these intangible assets or goodwill would result in an impairment charge that would negatively impact our operating results.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P32_S13	Further, business conditions and other factors may also require us to reassess the useful lives associated with intangible assets.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P32_S14	Past acquisitions have proven difficult to integrate, and recent or future acquisitions, if any, could disrupt our business, dilute shareholder value and negatively affect our operating results.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We have acquired the technologies, assets and/or operations of other companies in the past and may acquire or make investments in companies, products, services and technologies in the future as part of our growth strategy.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P33_S1	If we fail to properly evaluate, integrate and execute on our acquisitions and investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P33_S2	To successfully complete an acquisition, we must properly evaluate the technology, market and management team, accurately forecast the financial impact of the transaction, including accounting charges and transaction expenses, integrate and retain personnel, combine potentially different corporate cultures and effectively integrate products and research and development, sales, marketing and support operations.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P33_S3	If we fail to do any of these, we may suffer losses and impair relationships with our employees, customers and strategic partners.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Additionally, management may be distracted from day-to-day operations.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P33_S5	We also may be unable to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, which are especially critical in light of Sarbanes-Oxley and other corporate governance requirements, and significant demands may be placed on our management and our operations, information services and financial, legal and marketing resources.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P33_S6	Finally, acquired businesses sometimes result in unexpected liabilities and contingencies, which may involve compliance with foreign laws, payment of taxes, labor negotiations or other unknown costs and expenses, which could be significant.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We may not be able to raise additional capital if required to support our business.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P34_S1	If we need to raise additional operating capital, we may find that our access to equity and debt capital markets is limited or blocked entirely.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P34_S2	In the past, our stock has traded at low volumes and overall investor confidence in the stock market could falter.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P34_S3	This could make it difficult or impossible to sell additional shares on the public markets.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P34_S4	In addition, it may be difficult and costly to obtain debt financing and we may be unable to borrow additional funds at acceptable cost, or at all, should the need arise.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P34_S5	If we are unable to raise capital as necessary, it may adversely affect our ability to invest in products or fund operations, which would materially harm our business and negatively affect operating results.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Taxing jurisdictions in the United States are becoming more aggressive with tax legislation and tax collection, particularly states facing significant budget deficits, which could expose us to additional tax liability that we have not been subject to in the past.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We make sales in many jurisdictions across the United States, most of which we do not have nexus in and, therefore, are not subject to sales, franchise, income and other state and local taxes.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Particularly in light of state revenue deficits, taxing jurisdictions have become more aggressive in defining nexus, among other things, which could result in us achieving nexus, or potentially achieving nexus in significantly more tax jurisdictions.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P35_S3	If this occurs and unless we are able to pass through this cost to our customers, our tax expense will increase which will negatively affect our results of operations.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P35_S4	Further, because state and local tax laws are becoming increasingly complex, our cost to monitor our state and local tax compliance will increase which will negatively affect our results of operations.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P35_S5	Additionally, there can be no assurance that we do not currently have unknown tax exposure in a state or local tax jurisdiction because of recent tax law changes which we are unaware of and the resulting liability could be significant and would negatively affect our results of operations.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	There may be restrictions on the use of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards due to a tax law ownership change.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code restricts the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P37_S1	At December 31, 2013, we had approximately $55.6 million of federal and $9.3 million of state net operating loss carryforwards, and $2.7 million of tax credit carryforwards.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Under the applicable tax rules, an ownership change occurs if greater than five percent shareholders of an issuer s outstanding common stock collectively increase their ownership percentage by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P38_S1	We have performed analyses of possible ownership changes which included consideration of a third-party study, and do not believe that an ownership change (as defined by this Section) has occurred.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P38_S2	However, if a tax law ownership change has occurred of which we are not aware, or if a tax law ownership change occurs in the future, we may have to adjust the valuation of our deferred tax assets, and could be at risk of having to pay income taxes notwithstanding the existence of our sizable carryforwards.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Further, to the extent that we have utilized our carryforwards from prior years, the existence of a previous tax law ownership change that we did not account for could result in liability for back taxes, interest, and penalties.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P38_S4	If we are unable to utilize our carryforwards and/or if we previously utilized carryforwards to which we were not entitled, it would negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P38_S5	Intellectual Property-Related Risk Factors Our software and service offerings could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which could expose us to additional costs and litigation and could adversely affect our ability to sell our products and services or cause shipment delays or stoppages.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P38_S6	It is difficult to determine whether our software and engineering services infringe third-party intellectual property rights, particularly in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which technologies often overlap and where there may be numerous patent applications pending, many of which are confidential when filed.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	were to discover that one of our software or service offerings, or a product based on one of our reference designs, violated a third-party s proprietary rights, we may not be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, to continue offering that product or service.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Similarly, third parties may claim that our current or future software products and services infringe their proprietary rights, regardless of whether such claims have merit.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Any such claims could increase our costs and negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	In certain cases, we have been unable to obtain indemnification against claims that third-party technology incorporated into our software products and services infringe the proprietary rights of others.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P40_S1	However, any indemnification we do obtain may be limited in scope or amount.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Even if we receive broad third-party indemnification, these entities may not have the financial capability to indemnify us in the event of infringement.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P40_S3	In addition, in some circumstances we are required to indemnify our customers for claims made against them that are based on our software products or services.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P40_S4	There can be no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims related to the software products and services we provide, or arising from the incorporation by us of third-party technology, and claims for indemnification from our customers resulting from such claims, will not be asserted or prosecuted against us.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P40_S5	Some of our competitors have, or are affiliated, with companies with substantially greater resources than we have, and these competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than we could.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P40_S6	In addition, we expect that software developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the software industry grows, and as the functionality of products in different industry segments increasingly overlap.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P40_S7	Such claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources in addition to potential product redevelopment costs and delays.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P40_S8	Furthermore, if we were unsuccessful in resolving a patent or other intellectual property infringement action claim against us, we may be prohibited from developing or commercializing certain of our technologies and products, or delivering services based on the infringing technology, unless we obtain a license from the holder of the patent or other intellectual property rights.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P40_S9	There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain any such license on commercially favorable terms, or at all.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P40_S10	If such license is not obtained, we would be required to cease these related business operations, which could negatively impact our business, revenue and operating results.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P40_S11	If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may be able to use our technology or trademarks, which could weaken our competitive position, reduce our revenue and increase our costs.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P40_S12	If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, our competitive position could be weakened and our revenue and operating results adversely affected.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P40_S13	We rely primarily on confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions as well as a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, to protect our intellectual property.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P40_S14	These laws and procedures provide only limited protection.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P40_S15	It is possible that another party could obtain patents that block our use of some, or all, of our software and services.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P40_S16	If that occurred, we would need to obtain a license from the patent holder or design around those patents.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P40_S17	The patent holder may or may not choose to make a license available to us at all, or on acceptable terms.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P40_S18	Similarly, it may not be possible to design around a blocking patent.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P40_S19	In general, there can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws will be effective to prevent misappropriation of our technology, or to prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to or competitive with those developed by us.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We frequently license the source code of our software products and the source code results of our services to customers.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P41_S1	There can be no assurance that customers with access to our source code will comply with the license terms or that we will discover any violations of the license terms or, in the event of discovery of violations, that we will be able to successfully enforce the license terms and/or recover the economic value lost from such violations.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	To license some of our software products, we rely in part on shrinkwrap and clickwrap licenses that are not signed by the end user and, therefore, may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P42_S1	As with other software, our software products are susceptible to unauthorized copying and uses that may go undetected, and policing such unauthorized use is difficult.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P43_S0	A significant portion of our marks include the word BSQUARE.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P44_S0	words, and we cannot prevent all such third-party uses.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P44_S1	We license certain trademark rights to third parties.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Such licensees may not abide by our compliance and quality control guidelines with respect to such trademark rights.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Any of these outcomes could negatively impact our brand, dilute its recognition in the marketplace, or confuse potential customers, all of which could harm our business.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The computer software market is characterized by frequent and substantial intellectual property litigation, which is often complex and expensive, and involves a significant diversion of resources and uncertainty of outcome.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property or to defend against a claim of infringement or invalidity.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Litigation could result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources and could negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Our software or hardware products or the third-party hardware or software integrated with our products or delivered as part of our service offerings may suffer from defects or errors that could impair our ability to sell our products and services.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P45_S4	Software and hardware components as complex as those needed for smart connected systems frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P45_S5	We have had to delay commercial release of certain versions of our products until problems were corrected and, in some cases, have provided product enhancements to correct errors in released products.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P45_S6	Some of our contracts require us to repair or replace products that fail to work.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P45_S7	To the extent that we repair or replace products our expenses may increase.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P45_S8	In addition, it is possible that by the time defects are fixed, the market opportunity may decline which may result in lost revenue.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P45_S9	Moreover, to the extent that we provide increasingly comprehensive products and services, particularly those focused on hardware, and rely on third-party manufacturers and suppliers to manufacture these products, we will be dependent on the ability of third-party manufacturers to correct, identify and prevent manufacturing errors.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P45_S10	Errors that are discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance, diversion of development resources, damage to our reputation and increased service and warranty costs, all of which could negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P45_S11	If we are unable to license key software from third parties, our business could be harmed.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P45_S12	We sometimes integrate third-party software with our proprietary software and engineering service offerings or sell such third-party software offerings on a standalone basis (e.g. Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems under our ODA with Microsoft).
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P45_S13	If our relationships with these third-party software vendors were to deteriorate, or be eliminated in their entirety, we might be unable to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P45_S14	In the event that we are unable to obtain these third-party software offerings, we would be required to develop this technology internally, assuming it was economically or technically feasible, or seek similar software offerings from other third parties assuming there were competing offerings in the marketplace, which could delay or limit our ability to introduce enhancements or new products, or to continue to sell existing products and engineering services, thereby negatively impacting our revenue and operating results.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Governance-Related Risk Factors It might be difficult for a third-party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation, bylaws and Washington law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in the control of us or a change in our management, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Our Board of Directors has the authority under our amended and restated articles of incorporation to issue preferred stock with rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P46_S3	As a result, preferred stock could be issued quickly and easily with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make removal of our management more difficult.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P46_S4	In addition, our Board of Directors is divided into three classes.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P46_S5	The directors in each class serve for three-year terms, one class being elected each year by our shareholders.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P47_S0	offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company because it generally makes it more difficult for shareholders to replace a majority of our directors.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P47_S1	In addition, Chapter 19 of the Washington Business Corporation Act generally prohibits a target corporation from engaging in certain significant business transactions with a defined acquiring person for a period of five years after the acquisition, unless the transaction or acquisition of shares is approved by a majority of the members of the target corporation s Board of Directors prior to the time of acquisition.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P47_S2	This provision may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of our company.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P47_S3	The existence of these anti-takeover provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P48_S0	International Operations-Related Risk Factors Our international operations expose us to greater intellectual property, management, collections, regulatory and other risks.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Customers outside of North America generated 13% of our total revenue in 2013 and 20% in 2012.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P48_S2	We currently have sizable operations outside of North America in Taiwan and the United Kingdom and also have a minor sales and support presence in Japan.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P48_S3	In 2013, we closed our operations in Korea, China and Germany.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P48_S4	Our international activities and operations expose us to a number of risks, including the following:
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Complex and/or adverse tax laws and/or changes thereto.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P50_S0	The inherent risks of working in a certain highly regulated and/or controlled economies where relationships between company management and government officials is critical to timely processing of approvals required to conduct business.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P50_S1	These risks could have a material adverse effect on the financial and managerial resources required to operate our foreign offices, as well as on our future international revenue, which could negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P50_S2	As our customers seek more cost-effective locations to develop and manufacture their products, particularly overseas locations, our ability to continue to sell these customers our software products and services could be limited, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P51_S0	ability to sell these customers our software and services.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P51_S1	As an example, under our ODA with Microsoft, we are currently only able to sell Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems to our customers in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean (excluding Cuba), Mexico, the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
1054721_14_ITEM1A_P51_S2	If our customers, or potential customers, move their manufacturing overseas we may be restricted from reselling Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems to these customers or we would be less competitive, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	which extended the lease term to May 2020 and reduced the leased square footage to 24,000 square feet effective upon completion of leasehold improvements that are expected to be completed in early 2014.
1054721_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	In North America, we also lease office space in San Diego, California; Boston, Massachusetts; and Akron, Ohio.
1054721_14_ITEM2_P0_S2	We lease office space overseas in Tokyo, Japan, Taipei, Taiwan; and Trowbridge, United Kingdom.
1054721_14_ITEM2_P0_S3	Our facilities have sufficient capacity to support our current operational needs as well as short-term growth plans.
1054721_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol BSQR.
1054721_14_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table sets forth the high and low closing prices for our common stock for the periods indicated, as reported by the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
1054721_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of January 31, 2014, there were 127 holders of record of our common stock.
1054721_14_ITEM5_P1_S1	Because many shares of our common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of shareholders, we are unable to determine the total number of shareholders represented by these holders of record.
1054721_14_ITEM5_P1_S2	Dividends We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock.
1054721_14_ITEM5_P1_S3	We currently intend to retain any future earnings to fund future development and growth and, therefore, do not anticipate paying any consistent cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1054721_14_ITEM5_P1_S4	Our Board of Directors has, however, periodically considered implementing a share repurchase program and/or a special one-time cash dividend.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations may contain some statements and information which are not historical facts but are forward-looking statements.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P0_S2	For a discussion of these forward-looking statements, and of important factors that could cause results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this report, see Item 1 of Part I, Business Forward-Looking Statements, and Item 1A of Part I, Risk Factors.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	We provide software solutions and related engineering services to companies that develop smart, connected systems.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	A smart, connected system is a dedicated purpose computing device that typically has a display, runs an operating system (e.g., Microsoft Windows Embedded Compact) and is usually connected to a network or data cloud via a wired or wireless connection.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	Examples of smart, connected systems include set-top boxes, home gateways, point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, voting machines, gaming platforms, tablets, handheld data collection devices, personal media players, smart phones, vending machines, in-vehicle telematics and entertainment devices.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P2_S2	We primarily focus on smart, connected systems that utilize Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems as well as devices running other popular operating systems such as Android, Linux, and QNX.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P2_S3	We have been providing software solutions for smart, connected systems since our inception.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P2_S4	Our customers include world class OEMs, ODMs and Enterprises, as well as SVs and peripheral vendors which purchase our software solutions for purposes of facilitating processor and peripheral sales.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P2_S5	In the case of Enterprises, our customers include those which develop, market and distribute smart, connected systems on their own behalf as well as those that purchase systems from OEMs or ODMs and require additional software, integration and/or testing.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P2_S6	The software solutions we provide are utilized and deployed throughout various phases of our customers device life cycle, including design, development, customization, quality assurance and deployment.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	Critical Accounting Judgments Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from software and engineering service sales when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the selling price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	Contracts and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P3_S2	Shipping documents and time records are generally used to verify delivery.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P3_S3	We assess whether the selling price is fixed or determinable based on the contract and/or customer purchase order and payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P3_S4	We assess collectability based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer s payment history.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P3_S5	Periodically, we will begin work on engineering service engagements prior to having a signed contract and, in some cases, the contract is signed in a quarter after which service delivery costs are incurred.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P3_S6	We do not defer costs associated with such engagements before we have received a signed contract.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P3_S7	We recognize software revenue upon shipment provided that no significant obligations remain on our part, substantive acceptance conditions, if any, have been met and the other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	Service revenue from time and materials contracts, and training service agreements, is recognized as services are performed.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	Fixed-price service agreements, and certain time and materials service agreements with capped fee structures, are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method assuming reasonable estimates of completion can be made.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P4_S2	We use the percentage-of-completion method of accounting because we believe it is the most accurate method to recognize revenue based on the nature and scope of these engineering service contracts; we believe it is a better measure of periodic income results than other methods and better matches revenue recognized with the costs incurred.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	input measures such as hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	Significant judgment is required when estimating total hours and progress to completion on these arrangements which determines the amount of revenue we recognize as well as whether a loss is recognized if one is expected to be incurred for the remainder of the project.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	Revisions to hour and cost estimates are incorporated in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	We also enter into arrangements in which a customer purchases a combination of software licenses, engineering services and post-contract customer support and/or maintenance ( PCS ).
1054721_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	As a result, contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting, including how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements if there are multiple elements.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	PCS may include rights to upgrades, when and if available, telephone support, updates and enhancements.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	When vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) of fair value exists for all elements in a multiple element arrangement, revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each of the elements.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	VSOE of fair value is established by the price charged when the same element is sold separately.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P9_S2	Accordingly, the judgments involved in assessing the fair values of various elements of an agreement can impact the recognition of revenue in each period.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P9_S3	Changes in the allocation of the sales price between deliverables might impact the timing of revenue recognition, but would not change the total revenue recognized on the contract.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	When elements such as software and engineering services are contained in a single arrangement, or in related arrangements with the same customer, we allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value, provided that such element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	In the absence of fair value for a delivered element, revenue is first allocated to the fair value of the undelivered elements and then allocated to the residual delivered elements.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P10_S2	In the absence of fair value for an undelivered element, the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting, resulting in a delay of revenue recognition for the delivered elements until the undelivered elements are fulfilled.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	When engineering services and royalties are contained in a single arrangement, we recognize revenue from engineering services as earned in accordance with the criteria above even though the effective rate per hour may be lower than typical because the customer is contractually obligated to pay royalties on their device shipments.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	We recognize royalty revenue, classified as software revenue, when the royalty report from the customer is received or when such royalties are contractually guaranteed and the other revenue recognition criteria are met, particularly that collectability is reasonably assured.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	There are two items involving revenue recognition that require us to make more difficult and subjective judgments: the determination of VSOE of fair value in multiple element arrangements and the estimation of percentage of completion on fixed-price service contracts.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	Historically, we have entered into very few multiple-element arrangements other than those involving the sale of PCS related to our TestQuest automated testing tools.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	We establish VSOE of fair value for TestQuest PCS based on the price when PCS is sold separately.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	VSOE of TestQuest PCS has been well established in the past as these products have been sold on a stand-alone basis for a number of years even prior to our acquisition of TestQuest assets in November 2008.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	We measure our estimate of completion on fixed-price contracts, which in turn determines the amount of revenue we recognize, based primarily on actual hours incurred to date and our estimate of remaining hours necessary to complete the contract.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	The process of estimating the remaining hours on a contract involves detailed estimates of remaining hours by the engineers and project managers involved with the project, factoring in such variables as the remaining tasks, the complexity of the tasks, the contracted quality of the software to be provided, the customer s estimated delivery date, integration of third-party software and quality thereof and other factors.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	Every fixed-price contract requires various approvals within our company, including our Chief Executive Officer if significant.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	This approval process takes into consideration a number of factors including the complexity of engineering.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	Historically, our estimation processes related to fixed-price contracts have been accurate based on the information known at the time of the reporting of our results.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	However, percentage-of-completion estimates require significant judgment.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	As of December 31, 2013, we were delivering engineering services under eight fixed-price service contracts.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	The percentage of completion calculations on these contracts represents management s best estimates based on the facts and circumstances as of the filing of this report.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	there are changes to the underlying facts and circumstances, revisions to the percentage-of-completion calculations will be recorded in the period the changes are noted.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	If we were 10% under in our estimates of completion on every fixed-bid contract active on December 31, 2013, our revenue would be over-stated by $280,000 for 2013.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	We evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	Our intangible assets were acquired through business acquisitions.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	Our intangible assets consist of customer relationships and non-compete agreements.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P21_S2	Factors that could trigger an impairment analysis include significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	If this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired, we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	If this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining useful life, we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P22_S2	Any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P22_S3	We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P22_S4	Our annual testing date is December 31.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P22_S5	We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P22_S6	If it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount, further testing of impairment is not performed.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	If it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, we perform a quantitative two-step impairment test.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	Our stock-based compensation expense for stock options is estimated at the grant date based on the stock award s fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton ( BSM ) option-pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	The BSM model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and option life.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P24_S2	If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	Restricted stock units ( RSUs ) and restricted stock awards ( RSAs ) are measured based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant as determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience and expected future activity.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	To the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimates, stock-based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	Incentive Compensation We make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions regarding the likelihood of attainment, and the level thereof, of bonuses payable under our annual incentive compensation programs.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	We accrue bonuses and recognize the resulting expense when the bonus is judged to be reasonably likely to be earned as of year-end and is estimable.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P27_S2	The amount accrued, and expense recognized, is the estimated portion of the bonus earned on a year-to-date basis less any amounts previously accrued.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P27_S3	These estimates, judgments and assumptions are made quarterly based on available information and take into consideration our year-to-date actual results and expected results for the remainder of the year.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P27_S4	Because we consider estimated future results in assessing the likelihood of attainment, significant judgment is required.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P27_S5	If actual results differ materially from our estimates, the amount of bonus expense recorded in a particular quarter could be significantly over or under estimated.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the countries and other jurisdictions in which we operate.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	This process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P28_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P28_S3	Net operating losses and tax credits, to the extent not already utilized to offset taxable income or income taxes, also give rise to deferred tax assets.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P28_S4	We must then assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income, and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P28_S5	Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	We estimate the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P29_S1	Our sales may be subject to other taxes, particularly withholding taxes, due to our sales to customers in countries other than the United States.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P29_S2	The tax regulations governing withholding taxes are complex, causing us to have to make assumptions about the appropriate tax treatment.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P29_S3	Further, we make sales in many jurisdictions across the United States, where tax regulations are varied and complex.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P29_S4	We must therefore continue to analyze our state tax exposure and determine what the appropriate tax treatments are, and make estimates for sales, franchise, income and other state taxes.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	The following table presents certain financial data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	Our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	Our revenue is generated from the sale of software, both our own proprietary software and third-party software that we resell, and the sale of engineering services.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P32_S1	Total revenue decreased $9.3 million, or 9%, to $92.1 million in 2013 from $101.4 million in 2012.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P32_S2	This decrease was driven by lower sales of third party Windows Mobile operating systems and a decline in proprietary software and service revenue, partially offset by an increase in sales of the third party Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems and Adobe Flash revenue.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P32_S3	Revenue from our customers outside of North America decreased $7.7 million, or 39%, to $11.7 million in 2013, from $19.8 million in 2012.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P32_S4	Revenue from our customers outside of North America represented 13% of our total revenue in 2013, compared to 20% in 2012.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P32_S5	The decrease in non-North American revenue in 2013 was primarily attributable to lower sales of Windows Mobile operating systems, lower service revenue and lower proprietary software sales in Asia.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P32_S6	Specifically, a portion of the Windows Mobile operating systems sales decline resulted from the expiration of our Korea distribution rights on October 31, 2012, as prior sales in Korea contributed $4.5 million of Windows Mobile operating systems revenue in 2012.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	Software revenue Software revenue consists of sales of third-party software and revenue realized from our own proprietary software products, which include software license sales, royalties from our software products, support and maintenance revenue, and royalties from certain engineering service contracts.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P33_S1	Software revenue for 2013 and 2012 was as follows (dollars in thousands):
1054721_14_ITEM7_P33_S2	The vast majority of our third-party software revenue is comprised of sales of Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P33_S3	Third-party software revenue decreased $239,000, or 0.3%, in 2013 compared to the prior year.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P33_S4	Proprietary software revenue decreased $2.2 million, or 47%, in 2013 compared to 2012 driven by a significant one-time HTML5 sale in Japan in 2012, a decline in Handset Certification Platform revenue from our customers in China who did not renew their subscription contracts, a decline in Testquest licensing revenue and lower support revenue.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P33_S5	Service revenue Service revenue for 2013 and 2012 was as follows (dollars in thousands):
1054721_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	Service revenue decreased $6.9 million, or 27%, in 2013 as compared to the prior year.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	This decrease was due to a $3.8 million decline in North America service revenue driven primarily by a $1.9 million decrease associated with the MyFord Touch Program and net decreases from other North America customers.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P34_S2	We also experienced a $1.8 million decline in Japan and a $1.0 million decline in EMEA due to decreases in activity from large customers.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	Microsoft Corporation ( Microsoft ) became our largest engineering services customer during the first quarter of 2012, replacing Ford Motor Company ( Ford ), as Microsoft replaced Ford as the invoiced customer on the MyFord Touch program.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	We continue to work on the MyFord Touch, a project we began with Ford during the second quarter of 2008; however, we now conduct these services through an agreement with Microsoft.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P35_S2	During the initial project with Ford, we provided hardware design and implementation, platform level software development, application level software development, quality assurance services and systems integration services.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P35_S3	The project has transitioned since the initial project such that we are now primarily focused on developing and integrating new user applications for the MyFord Touch, enhancing existing applications and customizing the MyFord Touch platform for additional vehicle models.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	The MyFord Touch program contributed $4.5 million in service revenue in 2013 compared to $6.4 million in 2012 representing a decline of $1.9 million or 30%.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	The decrease is attributable to a reduction in the number of engineers working on the MyFord Touch project as the amount of work on the increasingly mature platform has declined.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	Gross profit and gross margin Cost of software revenue consists primarily of the cost of third-party software products payable to third-party vendors and support costs associated with our proprietary software products.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P37_S1	Cost of service revenue consists primarily of salaries and benefits, contractor costs and re-billable expenses, related facilities and depreciation costs, and amortization of certain intangible assets related to acquisitions.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P37_S2	Gross profit on the sale of third-party software products is also positively affected by rebate credits we receive from Microsoft for the sale of Windows Embedded operating systems earned through the achievement of defined objectives.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P37_S3	Prior to the third quarter of 2013, the earned rebate amount was treated as a reduction in software cost of sales in the quarter earned.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P37_S4	Beginning in the third quarter of 2013, as a result of program modifications, we began treating a portion of the rebate as marketing development funds which are accounted for as a reduction in marketing expense if and when qualified program expenditures are made.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P37_S5	Under this rebate program, we earned $744,000 of rebate credits in 2013 and $888,000 in 2012, which were treated as a reduction in cost of sales.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P37_S6	Additionally, during 2013 we earned $409,000 in rebate credits which will be accounted for as a reduction in marketing expense if and when qualified expenditures are made.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	The following table outlines software, services and total gross profit (dollars in thousands):
1054721_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	Software gross profit and gross margin Software gross profit decreased by $1.8 million, or 12%, in 2013, compared to 2012, while software gross margin decreased by one percentage point.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	The decreases in gross profit and gross margin were primarily the result of the decline in high-margin proprietary software revenue.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	Third-party software gross margin was 16% in both 2013 and 2012.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	Proprietary software gross margin was 66% in 2013, compared to 78% in 2012 driven by the revenue decline compared to a relatively fixed cost of sales base.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P40_S2	Service gross profit and gross margin Service gross profit decreased $2.3 million, or 52%, in 2013 compared to 2012 driven by a $6.9 million decline in service revenue without a commensurate decline in service cost of sales.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P40_S3	Service gross margin was 11% in 2013, a six percentage point decrease from 17% in 2012.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P40_S4	The margin decline was driven by a 5% increase in our cost per billable hour due to lower utilization and fixed cost increases and a decline in our realized rate per hour of 2%.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P40_S5	During the fourth quarter of 2013, we made adjustments to reduce service related expenses to better align our costs with our future service revenue expectations which included the closure of our Beijing China delivery center.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	Operating expenses Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, commissions and bonuses for our sales, marketing and administrative personnel and related facilities and depreciation costs, as well as professional services fees (e.g., consulting, legal and audit).
1054721_14_ITEM7_P41_S1	Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $1.1 million, or 8%, to $15.4 million in 2013, from $14.3 million in 2012.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P41_S2	The increase was driven by severance and related costs associated with the departure of our former Chief Executive Officer in September 2013 and the departure of our former Senior Vice President of Worldwide Sales and Marketing in December 2013.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P41_S3	Additionally, the increase was driven by higher sales travel and entertainment costs and legal expenses.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P41_S4	Selling, general and administrative expenses represented 17% of our total revenue in 2013 compared to 14% of revenue in 2012.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P41_S5	Research and development Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for software development and quality assurance personnel, contractor and consultant costs and related facilities and depreciation costs.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P41_S6	Research and development expenses decreased $843,000, or 23%, to $2.8 million in 2013, from $3.6 million in 2012.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P41_S7	The decline was driven by lower wage and other expenses associated primarily with two separate cost reduction efforts one in the third quarter of 2012 and another in the fourth quarter of 2013.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P41_S8	Research and development expenses represented 3% of total revenue in 2013 and 4% in 2012.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	Other income, net Other income consists of interest income on our cash and investments, gains and losses we may recognize on our investments, gains or losses on foreign exchange transactions and other items.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	Other income was $40,000 in 2013 compared to $103,000 in 2012, representing a decline of $63,000 which was driven by a one-time reduction to earn-out consideration in 2012 related to the September 2011 acquisition of MPC Data, Ltd.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P42_S2	Income taxes Income tax expense was $2.2 million in 2013, compared to $366,000 in the year-ago period, a change of $1.8 million.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	In the third quarter of 2013, we determined that it was not more likely than not that we would generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize our US deferred tax assets.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	As a result, we increased our deferred tax asset valuation allowance by $2.2 million.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P43_S2	Deferred tax assets relative to our foreign jurisdictions were not affected.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	The factors we considered in recording a full valuation allowance on our US deferred tax assets included, among other things, our recent history of losses.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	Restructuring During the fourth quarter of 2013, we effected a restructuring that included a workforce reduction and the closure of our offices in Beijing, China and Munich, Germany.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P44_S2	The workforce reduction impacted approximately 20% of our worldwide workforce.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P44_S3	The restructuring was intended to better align our organizational structure with our strategic focus.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P44_S4	The staff reductions and office closures were substantially completed by the end of the fourth quarter of 2013 with some activities, including legal entity closures, continuing into 2014.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P44_S5	The results of this restructuring and associated asset impairment were recorded within loss from operations on our Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) .
1054721_14_ITEM7_P44_S6	See Note 12: Restructuring in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2013, we had $21.1 million of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash, compared to $20.6 million at December 31, 2012.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	Of these amounts, $13.5 million and $9.9 million were classified as cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively, Restricted cash is classified as long term and was $250,000 at December 31, 2013 and $875,000 at December 31, 2012.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P45_S2	This cash is restricted under the terms of our headquarters operating lease which will continue to secure that obligation through its expiration in 2020.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P45_S3	Our working capital was $19.8 million at December 31, 2013, compared to $20.6 million at December 31, 2012.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P45_S4	Net cash provided by operating activities was $619,000 in 2013, driven by positive net working capital changes of $2.1 million and non-cash expenses of $3.8 million, which were offset substantially by our net loss of $5.3 million.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P45_S5	Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.5 million in 2012 driven by net income of $916,000 and non-cash expenses of $2.2 million, offset in part by net negative working capital changes.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P45_S6	Investing activities provided cash of $3.0 million in 2013, due primarily to net proceeds of short-term investments of $2.5 million and a $625,000 reduction in restricted cash under the terms of our corporate headquarters lease amendment executed in August 2013.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P45_S7	Net cash used by investing activities was $1.2 million in 2012 driven by $391,000 in capital expenditures and payment of contingent acquisition consideration related to MPC of $631,000.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P45_S8	Financing activities generated $51,000 in 2013 and $205,000 in 2012, as a result of the exercise of employee stock options.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments will be sufficient to meet our needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	Cash Commitments We have the following future or potential cash commitments:
1054721_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	In conjunction with our activities under our ODAs with Microsoft, we enter OVRP commitments with Microsoft.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	Under these OVRPs, we are provided with volume pricing on a customer-by-customer basis assuming certain minimum unit volumes are met.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P47_S2	The OVRP terms are 12 months.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	committed per-unit volume rate and the actual per-unit rate we achieved based upon actual units purchased.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	The OVRP arrangements do not equate to a minimum purchase commitment but rather, the arrangements are a volume pricing arrangement based upon actual volume purchased.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P48_S2	In substantially all instances, we have reciprocal agreements with our customers such that we will receive per-unit price adjustments, similar to the amounts we would subsequently owe to Microsoft if such OVRP volumes are not met.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P48_S3	However, in the event a customer is unwilling or unable to pay us, we would be negatively impacted.
1054721_14_ITEM7_P48_S4	Based upon the credit-worthiness of our customers, our historical OVRP experience with our customers and OVRP arrangements in general, we do not believe we will incur any material liability in the current or future periods.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BSQUARE Corporation (the Corporation ) as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), shareholders equity and cash flows for the years then ended.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P0_S1	These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation s management.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P0_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P0_S3	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1054721_14_ITEM8_P0_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P0_S5	The Corporation is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P0_S6	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P0_S7	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P1_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P1_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P1_S2	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of BSQUARE Corporation as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1054721_14_ITEM8_P6_S0	Description of Business and Accounting Policies Description of Business BSQUARE Corporation ( BSQUARE ) was incorporated in Washington State in July 1994.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P7_S0	We provide software solutions and related engineering services to companies that develop smart, connected systems.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P8_S0	A smart, connected system is a dedicated purpose computing device that typically has a display, runs an operating system (e.g., Microsoft Windows CE) and is usually connected to a network or data cloud via a wired or wireless connection.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P8_S1	Examples of smart, connected systems include set-top boxes, home gateways, point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, voting machines, gaming platforms, tablets, handheld data collection devices, personal media players, smart phones, vending machines and in-vehicle telematics and entertainment devices.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P8_S2	We focus on smart, connected systems that utilize Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems as well as devices running other popular operating systems such as Android, Linux, and QNX.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P8_S3	We have been providing software solutions for smart, connected systems since our inception.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P8_S4	Our customers include world class original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ), original design manufacturers ( ODMs ) and corporate enterprises ( Enterprises ), as well as silicon vendors ( SVs ) and peripheral vendors which purchase our software solutions for purposes of facilitating processor and peripheral sales.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P8_S5	In the case of Enterprises, our customers include those which develop, market and distribute smart, connected systems on their own behalf as well as those that purchase systems from OEMs or ODMs and require additional software, integration and/or testing.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P8_S6	The software solutions we provide are utilized and deployed throughout various phases of our customers device life cycle, including design, development, customization, quality assurance and deployment.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P9_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of BSQUARE Corporation and our wholly owned subsidiaries.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P9_S1	All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P10_S0	Use of Estimates Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P10_S1	Examples include provisions for bad debts and income taxes, estimates of progress on professional engineering service arrangements, bonus accruals, fair value of intangible assets and property and equipment, fair values of stock-based awards and the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities, among other estimates.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P10_S2	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P11_S0	Basic income or loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, and excludes any dilutive effects of common stock equivalent shares, such as options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and warrants.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P11_S1	Restricted stock awards ( RSAs ) are considered outstanding and included in the computation of basic income or loss per share when underlying restrictions expire and the awards are no longer forfeitable.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P11_S2	Restricted stock units ( RSUs ) are considered outstanding and included in the computation of basic income or loss per share only when vested.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P11_S3	Diluted income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P11_S4	Common stock equivalent shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is anti-dilutive.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P11_S5	Unvested but outstanding RSUs and RSAs (which are forfeitable) are included in the diluted income per share calculation.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P12_S0	In a period where we are in a net loss position, the diluted loss per share is computed using the basic share count.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P13_S0	The following table presents a reconciliation of the number of shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted income (loss) per share (in thousands): Common stock equivalent shares of 990,831 and 1,034,183 were excluded from the computations of basic and diluted income per share for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, because their effect was anti-dilutive.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P14_S0	Unvested but outstanding RSUs and RSAs which are forfeitable are included in the diluted income per share calculation.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P15_S0	In a period where we are in a net loss position, the diluted loss per share is computed using the basic share count.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P16_S0	We invest our excess cash primarily in highly liquid debt instruments of U.S. government agencies and municipalities, debt instruments issued by foreign government, corporate commercial paper, money market funds, and corporate debt securities.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P16_S1	We classify all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months as short-term investments.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P16_S2	Short-term investments consist entirely of marketable securities which are all classified as available-for-sale securities and are recorded at their estimated fair value.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P16_S3	We determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P16_S4	We may or may not hold securities with stated maturities greater than 12 months until maturity.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P16_S5	As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify securities with maturities beyond 12 months as short-term investments.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P16_S6	We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of stockholders equity, except for unrealized losses determined to be other than temporary which are recorded in other expense.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P17_S0	Restricted Cash Our restricted cash represents funds held at a financial institution as security for an outstanding letter of credit expiring in 2020 related to our corporate headquarters lease obligation.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P18_S0	Financial Instruments and Concentrations of Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts receivable.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P18_S1	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We record accounts receivable at the invoiced amount net of an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P18_S2	We review customers which are past due to identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P18_S3	In determining the amount of the allowance, we make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P19_S0	Equipment, Furniture and Leasehold Improvements We account for equipment, furniture and leasehold improvements at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P19_S1	We compute depreciation of equipment and furniture using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three years.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P20_S0	straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful lives, ranging from two to ten years.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P20_S1	Maintenance and repairs costs are expensed as incurred.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P21_S0	When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, gains or losses are included in the statement of operations.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P22_S0	When facts and circumstances indicate that the value of long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying value of the asset to projected undiscounted future cash flows.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P22_S1	Upon indication that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss as a charge against current operations based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P23_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets were recorded as a result of business acquisitions and are stated at estimated fair value at the time of acquisition less accumulated amortization.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P24_S0	We amortize our acquired intangible assets using the straight-line method using lives ranging from one to ten years.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P25_S0	We review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P25_S1	We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P26_S0	If intangible assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P26_S1	Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P26_S2	We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P26_S3	If it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount, no further testing is performed.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P27_S0	If it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, we perform a quantitative two-step impairment test.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P28_S0	The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P28_S1	If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P29_S0	We record all fees payable and accrued liabilities related to the sale of third-party software, such as Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, as third-party software fees payable.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P30_S0	Research and Development Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P30_S1	Advertising Costs All costs of advertising, including cooperative marketing arrangements, are expensed as incurred.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P30_S2	Advertising expense was $501,000 in 2013 and $733,000 in 2012.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P31_S0	The estimated fair value of stock based awards is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the award, net of estimated forfeitures.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P32_S0	We estimate forfeitures of stock based awards based on historical experience and expected future activity.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P32_S1	The fair value of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P32_S2	The fair value of stock option awards are estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of each vesting tranche as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton ( BSM ) option-pricing model.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P33_S0	requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and option life.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P33_S1	If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P34_S0	Incentive Compensation We make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions regarding the likelihood of our attainment, and the level thereof, of bonuses payable under our annual incentive compensation programs.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P34_S1	We accrue bonuses and recognize the resulting expense when the bonus is judged to be reasonably likely to be earned as of year-end and is estimable.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P34_S2	The amount accrued, and expense recognized, is the estimated portion of the bonus earned on a year-to-date basis less any amounts previously accrued.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P34_S3	These estimates, judgments and assumptions are made quarterly based on available information and take into consideration our year-to-date actual results and expected results for the remainder of the year.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P34_S4	Because our attainment estimate factors estimated future results, significant judgment is required.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P34_S5	If actual results differ materially from our estimates, the amount of bonus expense recorded in a particular quarter could be significantly over or under estimated.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P35_S0	Comprehensive Income (Loss) Comprehensive income (loss) refers to net income (loss) and other revenue, expenses, gains and losses that, under generally accepted accounting principles, are recorded as an element of shareholders equity but are excluded from the calculation of net income (loss).
1054721_14_ITEM8_P36_S0	Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P36_S1	Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P37_S0	We compute income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred income taxes are provided for on the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P37_S1	Our deferred tax amounts are measured using currently enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P37_S2	A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P38_S0	We recognize tax benefits from an uncertain position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based on its technical merits.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P38_S1	The tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P38_S2	Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are classified in the financial statements as income tax expense.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P39_S0	The functional currency of foreign subsidiaries is their local currency.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P39_S1	Accordingly, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P39_S2	Resulting translation adjustments are included in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss , a separate component of shareholders equity.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P40_S0	The net gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are recorded in the period incurred and were not significant for any of the periods presented.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P41_S0	We recognize revenue from software and engineering service sales when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the selling price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P41_S1	Contracts and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P42_S0	and time records are generally used to verify delivery.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P43_S0	We assess whether the selling price is fixed or determinable based on the contract and/or customer purchase order and payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P43_S1	We assess collectability based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer s payment history.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P43_S2	Periodically, we will begin work on engineering service engagements prior to having a signed contract and, in some cases, the contract is signed in a quarter after which service delivery costs are incurred.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P43_S3	We do not defer costs associated with such engagements before we have received a signed contract.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P43_S4	We recognize software revenue upon shipment provided that no significant obligations remain on our part, substantive acceptance conditions, if any, have been met and the other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P44_S0	Service revenue from time and materials contracts, and training service agreements, is recognized as services are performed.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P44_S1	Fixed-price service agreements, and certain time and materials service agreements with capped fee structures, are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method assuming reasonable estimates of completion can be made.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P45_S0	We use the percentage-of-completion method of accounting because we believe it is the most accurate method to recognize revenue based on the nature and scope of these engineering service contracts; we believe it is a better measure of periodic income results than other methods and it better matches revenue recognized with the costs incurred.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P45_S1	Percentage of completion is measured based primarily on input measures such as hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P45_S2	Significant judgment is required when estimating total hours and progress to completion on these arrangements which determines the amount of revenue we recognize as well as whether a loss is recognized if one is expected to be incurred for the remainder of the project.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P46_S0	Revisions to hour and cost estimates are incorporated in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P47_S0	We also enter into arrangements in which a customer purchases a combination of software licenses, engineering services and post-contract customer support and/or maintenance ( PCS ).
1054721_14_ITEM8_P47_S1	As a result, judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting, including how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements if there are multiple elements.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P48_S0	PCS may include rights to upgrades, when and if available, telephone support, updates and enhancements.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P49_S0	When vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) of fair value exists for all elements in a multiple element arrangement, revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each of the elements.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P49_S1	VSOE of fair value is established by the price charged when the same element is sold separately.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P49_S2	Accordingly, the judgments involved in assessing the fair values of various elements of an agreement can impact the recognition of revenue in each period.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P49_S3	Changes in the allocation of the sales price between deliverables might impact the timing of revenue recognition, but would not change the total revenue recognized on the contract.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P50_S0	When elements such as software and engineering services are contained in a single arrangement, or in related arrangements with the same customer, we allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value, provided that such element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P50_S1	In the absence of fair value for a delivered element, revenue is first allocated to the fair value of the undelivered elements and then allocated to the residual delivered elements.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P50_S2	In the absence of fair value for an undelivered element, the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting, resulting in a delay of revenue recognition for the delivered elements until the undelivered elements are fulfilled.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P51_S0	When engineering services and royalties are contained in a single arrangement, we recognize revenue from engineering services as earned in accordance with the criteria above even though the effective rate per hour may be lower than typical because the customer is contractually obligated to pay royalties on their device shipments.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P51_S1	We recognize royalty revenue, classified as software revenue, when the royalty report from the customer is received or when such royalties are contractually guaranteed and the other revenue recognition criteria are met, particularly the criteria that collectability is reasonably assured.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P52_S0	Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists to bring conformity in the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P53_S0	ASU 2013-11 became effective for us on January 1, 2014.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P53_S1	We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or notes to the consolidated financial statements.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P54_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P54_S1	Under ASU 2013-02, an entity is required to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ( AOCI ) by component.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P54_S2	In addition, an entity is required to present, either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of AOCI by the respective line items of net income, but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety in the same reporting period.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P54_S3	For amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures that provide additional details about those amounts.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P55_S0	ASU 2013-02 does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the financial statements.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P55_S1	Our adoption of ASU 2013-02 effective January 1, 2013 did not have any effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P56_S0	Cash and Investments Cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash consist of the following (in thousands):
1054721_14_ITEM8_P57_S0	Gross unrealized gains and losses on our cash equivalents and short-term investments were not material as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P57_S1	Our restricted cash balance at December 31, 2013 and 2012 relates to a letter of credit which secures our corporate headquarters lease.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P58_S0	Fair Value Measurements We measure our cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash at fair value.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P58_S1	Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P58_S2	As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P58_S3	A three-tier fair value hierarchy is established as a basis for considering such assumptions and for inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:
1054721_14_ITEM8_P59_S0	Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P60_S0	Level 2: Directly or indirectly observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs used in models or other valuation methodologies.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P61_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P61_S1	The inputs require significant management judgment or estimation.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P62_S0	We classify our cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash within Level 1 or Level 2.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P62_S1	This is because we value these items using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs that are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including third-party pricing services, brokers and market transactions.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P62_S2	We review the pricing techniques and methodologies of the independent pricing service for Level 2 investments and believe that the policies adequately consider market activity, either based on specific transactions for the security valued or based on modeling of securities with similar credit quality, duration, yield and structure that were recently traded.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P63_S0	Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in thousands):
1054721_14_ITEM8_P64_S0	Equipment, Furniture and Leasehold Improvements Equipment, furniture, and leasehold improvements consist of the following (in thousands): Depreciation and amortization expense of equipment, furniture and leasehold improvements was $495,000 in 2013 and $672,000 in 2012.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P64_S1	In 2013, we wrote off approximately $1.4 million of fully depreciated assets.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P65_S0	Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill was recorded in connection with the September 2011 acquisition of MPC Data, Ltd. ( MPC ), a United Kingdom based provider of software engineering services.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P65_S1	The excess of the acquisition consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P66_S0	Bsquare operates as a single reporting unit, and MPC falls within that reporting unit.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P66_S1	There was no change in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P67_S0	Intangible assets relate to customer relationships and non-compete agreements that we acquired from TestQuest Inc. in November 2008 and from the acquisition of MPC in September 2011.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P67_S1	Information regarding our intangible assets is as follows (in thousands):
1054721_14_ITEM8_P68_S0	Amortization expense was $206,000 and $321,000 for 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P68_S1	As of December 31, 2013, expected amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets for each of the next five years and thereafter is as follows (in thousands):
1054721_14_ITEM8_P69_S0	Other Income, Net The components of other income, net are as follows (in thousands):
1054721_14_ITEM8_P70_S0	Income Taxes Income (loss) before income taxes consists of the following (in thousands): Income tax expense consists of the following (in thousands):
1054721_14_ITEM8_P71_S0	The components of net deferred tax assets consist of the following (in thousands):
1054721_14_ITEM8_P72_S0	Our net deferred tax assets are recorded as follows (in thousands):
1054721_14_ITEM8_P73_S0	As of December 31, 2013, our deferred tax assets were primarily the result of U.S. NOL and tax credit carryforwards.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P73_S1	A valuation allowance of $27.7 million and $24.1 million was recorded against our gross deferred tax asset balance as of December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P73_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded an increase in valuation allowance of $3.6 million on the basis of management s reassessment of the amount of its deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P73_S3	As of each reporting date, our management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could impact management s view with regard to future realization of deferred tax assets.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P73_S4	In the third quarter of 2013, we determined that is was not more likely than not that we would generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize the portion of our net US deferred tax assets, which had been previously recognized, and we increased our valuation allowance in the U.S. by $2.2 million.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P73_S5	Deferred tax assets relative to our foreign tax jurisdictions were not affected.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P74_S0	The provision for income taxes differs from the amount of expected income tax expense (benefit) determined by applying the applicable U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to pre-tax income (loss), as a result of the following: At December 31, 2013, we had approximately $55.6 million of federal and $9.3 million of state net operating loss carryforwards, which have begun to expire, including $3.3 million of state losses in 2013.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P74_S1	Of the federal net operating loss carryforwards, an aggregate of $42.5 million will expire in 2022 and 2023.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P74_S2	We also have $2.7 million of tax credit carryforwards, which begin to expire in 2018.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P74_S3	Utilization of these carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation due to Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code which restricts the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use its carryforwards.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P75_S0	Under the applicable tax rules, an ownership change occurs if holders of more than five percent of an issuer s outstanding common stock, collectively, increase their ownership percentage by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P75_S1	We performed analyses of possible ownership changes, which included consideration of a third party study completed in 2012, and do not believe that an ownership change of more than 50 percentage points has occurred.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P75_S2	While the study has not been updated in 2013, we do not believe there have been any further impacts on the results of that analysis in 2013.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P75_S3	We have evaluated all the material income tax positions taken on our income tax filings to various tax authorities, and we determined that we did not have unrealized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions recorded at December 31, 2013 or 2012.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P75_S4	Because of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, substantially all of our tax years remain open and subject to examination.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P76_S0	Our commitments include obligations outstanding under operating leases, which expire through 2020.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P76_S1	We have lease commitments for office space in Bellevue, Washington; San Diego, California; Boston, Massachusetts; Taipei, Taiwan; Tokyo, Japan; and Trowbridge, UK.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P76_S2	We also lease office space on a month-to-month basis in Akron, Ohio.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P76_S3	In August 2013, we amended the lease agreement for our Bellevue, Washington headquarters and extended the term of the original lease that was scheduled to expire in August 2014 to May 2020.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P76_S4	Rent expense was $1.6 million in 2013 and $1.8 million in 2012.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P77_S0	As of December 31, 2013, we had $250,000 pledged as collateral for a bank letter of credit under the terms of our headquarters facility lease.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P77_S1	The pledged cash supporting the outstanding letter of credit is recorded as restricted cash.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P78_S0	In conjunction with our activities under the OEM Distribution Agreements ( ODAs ) with Microsoft Corporation ( Microsoft ), we enter into OEM Volume Royalty Pricing ( OVRP ) commitments with Microsoft.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P78_S1	Under these OVRPs, we are provided with volume pricing on a customer-by-customer basis assuming certain minimum unit volumes are met.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P78_S2	The OVRP terms are 12 months.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P78_S3	In the event we don t meet the committed minimum unit volumes, we are obligated to pay the difference between the committed per-unit volume rate and the actual per-unit rate we achieved based upon actual units purchased.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P78_S4	The OVRP arrangements do not equate to a minimum purchase commitment but rather, the arrangements are a volume pricing arrangement based upon actual volume purchased.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P78_S5	In substantially all instances, we have reciprocal agreements with our customers such that we will receive per-unit price adjustments, similar to the amounts we would subsequently owe to Microsoft if such OVRP volumes are not met.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P78_S6	However, in the event a customer is unwilling or unable to pay us, we would be negatively impacted.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P78_S7	Based upon the credit-worthiness of our customers, our historical OVRP experience with our customers and OVRP arrangements in general, we do not believe we will incur any material liability in the current or future periods relating to existing agreements.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P79_S0	Shareholders Equity Equity Compensation Plans We have a stock plan (the Stock Plan ) and an inducement stock plan for newly hired employees (the Inducement Plan ) (collectively the Plans ).
1054721_14_ITEM8_P79_S1	Under the Plans, stock options may be granted with a fixed exercise price that is equivalent to fair market value on the date of grant.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P79_S2	These options have a term of up to 10 years and vest over a predetermined period, generally four years.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P79_S3	Incentive stock options granted under the Stock Plan may only be granted to our employees.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P79_S4	The Plans also allow for awards of non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSAs and unrestricted stock awards, and RSUs.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P80_S0	The estimated fair value of stock-based awards is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the award, net of estimated forfeitures.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P81_S0	We estimate forfeitures of stock based awards based on historical experience and expected future activity.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P82_S0	The fair value of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P82_S1	The fair value of stock option awards are estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of each vesting tranche as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton ( BSM ) option-pricing model.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P82_S2	The BSM model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and option life.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P82_S3	If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P83_S0	The fair values of our equity awards, primarily stock option grants, were estimated with the following weighted average assumptions:
1054721_14_ITEM8_P84_S0	The following table summarizes stock option activity under the Plans for 2013 and 2012:
1054721_14_ITEM8_P85_S0	At December 31, 2013, total compensation cost related to stock options granted to employees under the Plans but not yet recognized was $296,340, net of estimated forfeitures.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P85_S1	This cost will be amortized on the straight-line method over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.3 years.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P86_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the quoted price of our common stock for the number of options that were in-the-money at year end.
1054721_14_ITEM8_P87_S0	We issue new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options.

1054721_14_ITEM9A_P0_S1	In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our CEO and CFO, as of December 31, 2013, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.

1054721_14_ITEM9A_P0_S4	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

1054721_15_ITEM1_P34_S1	To advance this strategy, we intend to focus on the following:
1054721_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	Building our offerings and capabilities in the rapidly growing Internet of Things market.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	Seeking additional software products, such as DataV and MobileV, in which to invest.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	Relationship with Microsoft and Impact on our Smart Connected Solutions Business We have a long-standing relationship with Microsoft and this relationship is critical to the continuing success of our business.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P37_S1	Our credentials as a Microsoft partner include:
1054721_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	We have been engaged by Microsoft on various engineering service engagements.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P39_S0	We work closely with Microsoft executives, developers, product managers and sales personnel.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P39_S1	We leverage these relationships in a variety of ways, including:
1054721_15_ITEM1_P40_S0	We receive rebates from Microsoft based upon the achievement of predefined sales objectives.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for more information regarding our relationship with Microsoft.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	Customers Customers purchasing third-party software and our software solutions and engineering services include leading OEMs, ODMs, Enterprises, SVs and peripheral vendors seeking to leverage the software we provide them, be it our own proprietary software, third-party software or custom software developed via our engineering services, to develop high-quality, smart connected systems that meet the requirements of numerous end-markets.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P42_S1	Representative customers include Coca-Cola, Future Electronics, Elo Touch Solutions, Honeywell International, Inc., IGT, Microsoft, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Panasonic, Elektrobit, Bally and several industrial handset companies.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	Sales and Marketing We market our software solutions and engineering services utilizing a direct sales model.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P43_S1	We have sales personnel throughout the United States and in Taiwan, the United Kingdom and Japan.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	Historically, we have not made significant use of resellers, channel partners, representative agents or other indirect channels.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P44_S1	Key elements of our sales and marketing strategy include direct marketing, content marketing, trade shows, event marketing, public relations, analyst relations, social media properties, customer and strategic alliance partner co-marketing programs and a comprehensive website.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P44_S2	We rely significantly on lead referral and other marketing support programs from strategic partners.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P45_S0	Research and Development Our research and development personnel are responsible for the design, development and release of our proprietary software products.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P45_S1	Members of our research and development staff work closely with our sales and marketing departments, as well as with our customers and potential customers, to better understand market needs and requirements.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P45_S2	We perform our research and development primarily utilizing engineering staff located in the United States.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P45_S3	Research and development expense was $1.7 million and $2.8 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P45_S4	The decrease was driven largely by our cost reduction efforts in the fourth quarter of 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	Competition The market for smart connected systems software and services is extremely competitive.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P46_S1	We face competition from the following:
1054721_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	Mobile and embedded test automation providers including Perfecto Mobile, mVerify, JAMO Solutions, SmartBear Software (AutomatedQA), TestPlant (eggPlant) and Keynote.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	We will encounter increasing competition in the growing Internet of Things market from a number of additional software and service providers as we expand our focus on this market in 2015 and beyond.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P49_S0	Some of our competitors focus on only one aspect of our business or offer complementary products which can be integrated with our products.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P49_S1	As we develop and bring to market new software products and service offerings, we may begin competing with companies with which we have not previously competed.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P49_S2	Further, as we expand the geographic markets into which we sell our software solutions and related services, or increase our penetration therein, we may expect to increasingly compete with companies with which we have not previously competed.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P49_S3	It is also possible that new competitors will enter the market or that our competitors will form alliances, including alliances with Microsoft, that may enable them to rapidly increase their market share.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P49_S4	Microsoft has not agreed to any exclusive arrangement with us, nor has it agreed not to compete with us.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P49_S5	Microsoft may decide to bring more of the core embedded development services and expertise that we provide in-house, possibly resulting in reduced software and service revenue opportunities for us.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P50_S0	The barrier to entering the market as a provider of Microsoft-based smart connected systems software and services is low.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P50_S1	In addition, Microsoft has created marketing programs to encourage systems integrators to work on Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating system software and services.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P50_S2	These systems integrators are given substantially the same access by Microsoft to the Microsoft technology as we are.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P50_S3	New competitors may have lower overhead than we do and may be able to undercut our pricing.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P50_S4	We expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter the connected device market, and as new products and technologies are introduced.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P51_S0	Our international operations outside of North America consist principally of operations in Taipei, Taiwan and Trowbridge, England.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P51_S1	We have a sales and sales support office in Tokyo, Japan.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P51_S2	Because our OEM Distribution Agreement with Microsoft for the sale of Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems (e.g. Windows Embedded Compact) has been, until relatively recently, restricted to North America, including Mexico, the majority of our revenue continues to be generated from North America.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P51_S3	In 2014, revenue generated from customers located outside of North America was 10% of total revenue, compared to 13% in 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P51_S4	The decrease in non-North American revenue in 2014 was primarily attributable to lower sales of Windows Mobile operating systems, lower service revenue and lower proprietary software sales in Asia.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P51_S5	See Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for more information regarding our international operations.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P52_S0	The following indicates the total headcount by area:
1054721_15_ITEM1_P53_S0	Of the total headcount of 197 at December 31, 2014, 112 were located in North America, 47 in Taiwan, 36 in the United Kingdom and 2 in Japan.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P54_S0	As conditions necessitate, engineering service employees perform research and development activities and vice versa.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P55_S0	In October 2013, we effected a headcount reduction that impacted approximately 20% of our worldwide workforce.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P56_S0	In general, we strive to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and through contractual arrangements.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P56_S1	However, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be effective to prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, or to prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to, or competitive with, those developed by us.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P56_S2	Additionally, because a significant portion of our revenue relates to the sale of third-party software products, we also rely on our partners, particularly Microsoft, to appropriately protect their own intellectual property.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P56_S3	As of December 31, 2014 we have eight issued United States ( US ) patents and one pending US patent application.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P56_S4	We also have a number of registered trademarks in various jurisdictions.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P56_S5	We will continue to pursue appropriate protections for our intellectual property.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P56_S6	See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for more information regarding our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P57_S0	We electronically file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P57_S1	We make available on our website at www.bsquare.com, free of charge, copies of these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing such reports with, or furnishing them to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1054721_15_ITEM1_P57_S2	The following table sets forth certain information with respect to our directors and executive officers as of January 31, 2015:
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	As discussed under Item 1 of Part I, Business Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, our actual results could differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and the trading price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Microsoft-Related Risk Factors Due to the fact that we provide software and services to customers building devices utilizing Microsoft s Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, as well as the fact that a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, Microsoft has a significant direct and indirect influence on our business.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P1_S3	The following Microsoft-related risk factors may negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P1_S4	If we do not maintain our OEM Distribution Agreements with Microsoft or if Microsoft de-emphasizes or divests itself from these areas of its business, our revenue would decrease and our business would be adversely affected.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We have OEM Distribution Agreements ( ODAs ) for Software Products for Embedded Systems with Microsoft, which enable us to sell various Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems to our customers in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean (excluding Cuba), Mexico, the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	These ODAs are effective through June 30, 2016.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	We have also entered into other ODAs with Microsoft pursuant to which we are licensed to sell Microsoft Windows Mobile operating systems to customers in North America, South America, Central America (excluding Cuba), Japan, Taiwan, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P2_S3	The ODAs to sell Windows Mobile operating systems are effective through June 30, 2015.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P2_S4	We generated $70.2 million and $64.0 million of revenue in 2014 and 2013, respectively, through our sales of Microsoft operating systems and expect this revenue stream to continue in 2015.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P2_S5	If any of the ODAs are terminated by Microsoft (which Microsoft can do unilaterally) or not renewed, or if Microsoft decides to no longer invest in or to divest itself from these areas of its business, our software revenue and resulting gross profit could decrease significantly and our operating results would be negatively impacted.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Future renewals, if any, could be on less favorable terms, which could also negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P2_S7	Microsoft can change pricing under the ODAs at any time, and unless we are able to either pass through price increases to our customers or sign our customers to 12-month purchasing commitments, which lowers the price we pay to Microsoft, our revenue, gross profit and operating results would be negatively impacted.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P2_S8	Further, Microsoft currently offers a rebate program in conjunction with our ODA activities in which we earn money for achieving certain predefined objectives.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P2_S9	If Microsoft were to eliminate or negatively modify the rebate program, our gross profit and operating results would be negatively impacted.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P2_S10	We qualified for rebate credits from Microsoft of $1.0 million and $1.2 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, a portion of which is accounted for as a reduction in cost of sales and a portion as a reduction in marketing expense if and when qualified expenditures are made.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P2_S11	Microsoft has audited our records under the ODAs in the past and will likely audit our records again in the future and any negative audit results could result in additional charges and/or the termination of the ODAs.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	There are provisions in the ODAs that require us to maintain certain internal records and processes for auditing and other reasons.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Non-compliance with these and other requirements could result in the termination of the ODAs.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Microsoft has concluded audits of our records pertaining to the ODAs in 2009 and 2006, neither of which had material findings.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	It is possible that future audits could result in charges due to any material findings that are found.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The provisions also include terms that may make us contractually liable for payment of royalties to Microsoft in the event that certificates of authenticity are lost, damaged or stolen.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	If we are invoiced by Microsoft for a pricing adjustments under OVRP arrangements and we are unable to pass through the charge to our customers, our operating results and cash flow would be negatively impacted.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	In conjunction with our activities under the ODAs with Microsoft, we enter into OEM Volume Royalty Program ( OVRP ) commitments with Microsoft.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Under these OVRPs, we are provided with volume pricing on a customer-by-customer basis assuming certain minimum unit volumes are met.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	The OVRP terms are 12 months.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P6_S3	In the event we don t meet the committed minimum unit volumes, we are obligated to pay the difference between the committed per-unit volume rate and the actual per-unit rate we achieved based upon actual units purchased.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P6_S4	The OVRP arrangements do not equate to a minimum purchase commitment but rather the arrangements are a volume pricing arrangement based upon actual volume purchased.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P6_S5	In substantially all instances, we have reciprocal agreements with our customers such that we will receive per-unit price adjustments, similar to the amounts we would subsequently owe to Microsoft if such OVRP volumes are not met.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P6_S6	While our history with OVRP arrangements has shown that very few result in a price adjustment and, for those that have, we have been able to pass through the price adjustment to our customer, in the event the customer is unwilling or unable to pay us, our operating results and cash flow would be negatively impacted.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	If we do not maintain our favorable relationship with Microsoft, we will have difficulty marketing and selling our software and services and may not receive developer releases of Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	As a result, our revenue and operating results could suffer.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	We maintain a strategic marketing relationship with Microsoft.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P7_S3	If our relationship with Microsoft deteriorates for any reason, such as an increased focus by us on customers building devices utilizing non-Microsoft operating systems, our efforts to market and sell our software and services to our customers could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Microsoft has significant influence over the development plans and buying decisions of customers utilizing the various Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Microsoft provides customer referrals to us.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Moreover, Microsoft controls the marketing campaigns related to its operating systems.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Microsoft s marketing activities are important to the continued promotion and market acceptance of Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems and, consequently, to our sale of Windows-based software and services.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P8_S4	We must maintain a favorable relationship with Microsoft to continue to participate in joint marketing activities with them, which includes participating in partner pavilions at trade shows, listing our services on Microsoft s website, and receiving customer referrals.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P8_S5	If we are unable to continue our joint marketing efforts with Microsoft, or fail to receive referrals from them, we would be required to devote significant additional resources and incur additional expenses to market our software products and services directly to potential customers.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P8_S6	In addition, we depend on Microsoft for developer releases of new versions of, and upgrades to, its Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile software in order to facilitate timely development and delivery of our own software and services.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P8_S7	If we are unable to maintain our favorable relationship with Microsoft and no longer continue receiving such new versions and updates, our revenue could decline significantly, and/or our costs could increase significantly, thereby negatively impacting our operating results.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P8_S8	Unexpected delays or announcement of delays by Microsoft related to product releases of Windows Embedded or Windows Mobile operating systems could adversely affect our revenue and operating results.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P8_S9	Unexpected delays or announcement of delays in Microsoft s delivery schedule for new versions of Windows Embedded or Windows Mobile operating systems could cause us to delay our product introductions or impede our ability to sell our products and services and/or to complete customer projects on a timely basis.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P8_S10	Such delays or announcements of delays by Microsoft could also cause our customers to delay or cancel their project development activities or product introductions, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P8_S11	If Microsoft adds features to its Windows operating systems or develops products that directly compete with products and services we provide, our revenue and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P8_S12	As the developer of Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, Microsoft could add features which eliminate or reduce our customers need for our software and services, or Microsoft could develop standalone products and services that compete with the products and services we provide to our customers.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P8_S13	The ability of our customers, or potential customers, to obtain products and services directly from Microsoft that compete with our products and services could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P8_S14	Even if the standard features of future Microsoft operating system software were more limited than our offerings, a significant number of our customers, and potential customers, might elect to accept more limited functionality in lieu of purchasing additional software from us or delay the purchase of our products and services while they perform a comparison of Microsoft s competing offerings.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P8_S15	Moreover, the resulting competitive pressures could lead to price reductions for our offerings and reduce our revenue and gross profit accordingly and our operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P8_S16	Our business and results of operations would be adversely impacted if Microsoft decided to provide some, or all, of its Windows Embedded or Windows Mobile operating systems which we currently resell, free of charge to customers.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Microsoft has recently announced programs to offer certain consumer Windows phone and tablet-based operating systems to customers free of charge, subject to certain limitations.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	While we do not distribute these operating systems today under our ODA with Microsoft, if Microsoft were to pursue a similar strategy and offer operating systems that we do currently distribute free of charge, our business and results of operations would be adversely impacted.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Microsoft will be introducing the Windows 10 operating system software in the near future, and Microsoft s pricing and support for this new operating system could directly impact our revenue and margins.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P9_S3	In January 2015, Microsoft announced a new operating system, Windows 10, but has not indicated when the software will be available to customers.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Microsoft indicated that Windows 10 will be delivered as a service which may alter the traditional business model used to sell Microsoft licenses as a software product.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P9_S5	As a reseller of Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, changes Microsoft s business model may adversely impact our revenue and gross profit and our operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	If the markets for Windows Embedded and/or Windows Mobile operating systems decline, our business and operating results may be materially harmed.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Because a significant portion of our revenue to date has been generated by software and services targeted at customers and devices utilizing the various Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, if the markets for these systems or platforms decline, our business and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Market acceptance of Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems will depend on many factors, including:
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Microsoft s development and support of various Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile markets.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	In Motion Limited ( RIM and other proprietary operating systems.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The willingness of software developers to continue to develop and expand the applications running on Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	To the extent that software developers write applications for competing operating systems that are more attractive to users than those available on Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, this could cause potential customers to select competing operating systems.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	MyFord Touch-Related Risk Factors If we do not obtain additional work on the MyFord Touch program, our future revenue and gross profit would decrease and our operating results would be adversely affected.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We began working on the MyFord Touch infotainment project with Ford in the second quarter of 2008 and continue to work on the program.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Since inception of the program through December 31, 2011, our contractual relationship was with Ford.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Effective January 1, 2012, our contractual relationship for the MyFord Touch program shifted from Ford to Microsoft, as Microsoft has become the primary vendor to Ford for this program.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P14_S4	In 2014 the relationship added Elektrobit Automotive.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P14_S5	In December 2014, Ford introduced Sync 3, the next generation MyFord Touch program that is scheduled to be deployed on cars in 2016 and will be based on QNX software from Blackberry instead of software from Microsoft.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Revenue from the MyFord Touch program comprised $2.8 million, or 3%, of our total revenue in 2014, and $4.5 million, or 5%, of our total revenue in 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P14_S7	We currently expect this project work to continue in 2015 but expect revenue from the MyFord Touch program to be lower, albeit still significant in 2015, than it was in 2013 due to the lower level of personnel resources utilized on the program.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P14_S8	Our statements of work with Microsoft and Ford currently run through June 30, 2015, and with Elektrobit through December 31, 2015.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P14_S9	While we expect to be actively involved in current generation MyFord Touch projects with Microsoft, Ford and Elektrobit through 2015 and beyond, we expect our role on MyFord Touch will be scaled back or eliminated because of the transition to QNX software for the next generation Sync 3 and our revenue and resulting gross profit will decline accordingly.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	General Business-Related Risk Factors Our marketplace is extremely competitive, which may result in price reductions, lower gross profit margins and loss of market share.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The market for device software and services is extremely competitive.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We face competition from the following:
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Mobile and embedded test automation providers including Perfecto Mobile, mVerify, JAMO Solutions, SmartBear Software (AutomatedQA), TestPlant (eggPlant) and Keynote.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating system distributors such as Arrow Electronics, Inc.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We will encounter increasing competition in the growing Internet of Things market from a number of additional software and service providers as we expand our focus on this market in 2015 and beyond.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Some of our competitors focus on only one aspect of our business or offer complementary products which can be integrated with our products.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	As we develop and bring to market new software products and service offerings, we may begin competing with companies with which we have not previously competed.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Further, as we expand the geographic markets into which we sell our software solutions and related services, or increase our penetration therein, we may expect to increasingly compete with companies with which we have not previously competed.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P20_S3	It is also possible that new competitors will enter the market or that our competitors will form alliances, including alliances with Microsoft, that may enable them to rapidly increase their market share.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Microsoft has not agreed to any exclusive arrangement with us, nor has it agreed not to compete with us.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Microsoft may decide to bring more of the core embedded development services and expertise that we provide in-house, possibly resulting in reduced software and service revenue opportunities for us.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The barrier to entering the market as a provider of Microsoft-based smart connected system software and services is low.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	In addition, Microsoft has created marketing programs to encourage systems integrators to work on Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating system software and services.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P21_S2	These systems integrators are given substantially the same access by Microsoft to the Microsoft technology as we are.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P21_S3	New competitors may have lower overhead than we do and may be able to undercut our pricing.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P21_S4	We expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter the connected device market, and as new products and technologies are introduced.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Management turnover creates uncertainties and could harm our business.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P21_S6	We had significant changes in executive leadership during 2013 and 2014 and more could occur.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P21_S7	Jerry D. Chase was appointed as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company in February 2014.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P21_S8	Mr. Chase joined our Board of Directors in July 2013 and had served as our interim Chief Executive Officer since September 23, 2013, after Brian Crowley stepped down as President and Chief Executive Officer and from the Board of Directors.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P21_S9	In October 2013, John Traynor, Senior Vice President, Products left the company as part of our restructuring.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P21_S10	In addition, Mike Stipe, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Sales and Marketing departed in December 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P21_S11	Mark D. Whiteside has taken on the role of Vice President, Solutions and Scott B. Caldwell has taken on the role as Vice President, Worldwide OEM Sales.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P21_S12	Scott Mahan resigned as Chief Financial Officer in August 2014 and was replaced by Martin L. Heimbigner in November 2014.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Changes to strategic or operating goals, which can often times occur with the appointment of new executives, can create uncertainty, may negatively impact our ability to execute quickly and effectively, and may ultimately be unsuccessful.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	In addition, executive leadership transition periods are often difficult as the new executives gain detailed knowledge of our operations, and friction can result from changes in strategy and management style.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Management turnover inherently causes some loss of institutional knowledge, which can negatively affect strategy and execution.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Until we integrate new personnel, and unless they are able to succeed in their positions, we may be unable to successfully manage and grow our business, and our financial condition and profitability may suffer.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Further, to the extent we experience additional management turnover, competition for top management is high and it may take months to find a candidate that meets our requirements.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P23_S3	If we are unable to attract and retain qualified management personnel, our business could suffer.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Our ability to maintain or grow our proprietary software revenue is contingent on our ability to bring to market competitive, unique offerings that keep pace with technological changes and needs.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P23_S5	If we are not successful in doing so, our business would be negatively impacted.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Proprietary software product revenue provides us with much higher gross profit margins than we typically receive from third-party software products and our engineering service offerings and provide other advantages as well.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Increasing the number and amount of proprietary products we sell is an important part of our growth strategy.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Our ability to maintain and increase the revenue contribution from proprietary software products is contingent on our ability to enhance the features and functionality of our current proprietary products as well as to devise, develop and introduce new products.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P24_S3	There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or expand the number of proprietary products that we sell, and our failure to do so could negatively impact revenue and our operating results.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We may experience delays in our efforts to develop new products and services, and these delays could cause us to miss market opportunities which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The market for our software and services evolves rapidly.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	As a result, the life cycles of our products and services are difficult to estimate.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P26_S2	To be successful, we believe we must continue to enhance our current offerings and provide new software and service offerings with attractive features, prices and terms that appeal to our customers.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P26_S3	We have experienced delays in new software and service offering introductions in the past and may do so again in the future.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Our revenue and operating results may be negatively impacted if we delay releases of new products, product enhancements and/or new services offerings, or if we fail to accurately anticipate our customers needs or technical trends and are unable to introduce new products and service offerings into the market successfully.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P26_S5	In addition, our customers may defer or forego purchases of our products and/or services if we, Microsoft, our competitors or major hardware, systems or software vendors introduce or announce new products.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P26_S6	Our future success depends upon our customers ability to successfully sell their products incorporating our technology, and to continue buying our services.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P26_S7	Even if a customer selects us to provide software and services, the customer may not ultimately market and sell its product successfully.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P26_S8	A cancellation or change in plans by a customer, whether from lack of market acceptance of its products or otherwise, could cause us to lose revenue that we had anticipated and our revenue and operating results would suffer.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P26_S9	Also, our revenue and operating results could suffer if a significant customer reduces or delays orders during our sales cycle or chooses not to release products that contain our technology.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P26_S10	If the market for smart, connected systems evolves based on technologies that we do not support, our revenue may not grow as anticipated, if at all, and our business would be harmed.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The technologies used in smart, connected systems change very rapidly and it is often difficult to foresee and predict which application processors, operating systems, connectivity, testing and application development technologies will gain a foothold in device development.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	As a smaller company we can invest our resources in a limited number of technologies and as such must make forward investments in developing products and capabilities to support the technologies that we choose.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P27_S2	If we make investments in technologies that do not gain traction in device development, our profit potential is uncertain and our revenue may not develop as anticipated.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P27_S3	We are dependent upon the broad acceptance and adoption by businesses and consumers of a wide variety of device technologies, which will depend on many factors, including:
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The amount of discretionary funds companies and individuals have to spend for the latest technologies.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	DataV, our new proprietary actionable data solution for the Internet of Things ( IoT) market may not gain traction with potential customers .
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	During 2014 we were developing our DataV proprietary software product, which is an actionable data solution for the Internet of Things (IoT) market.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	As a new product, DataV may gain customer traction in 2015 more slowly than anticipated and our profit potential from this new product is uncertain.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P30_S2	We expect to continue to make investments in the development of DataV, and this will increase our operating expenses.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P30_S3	We cannot assure you that there will be sufficient, or any, corresponding increases in revenue generated by sales of DataV, or if it will achieve customer adoption quickly, or at all.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P30_S4	MobileV, our new software product designed to address the needs of OEMs who are developing highly ruggedized and durable mobile computing products may not gain traction with potential customers.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P30_S5	During 2014, we began selling MobileV a complete hardware and software reference solution based on Intel architecture and Microsoft Windows Embedded 8.1 that combines board reference designs from Aava Mobile, along with our proprietary software to address the needs of OEMs who are developing highly ruggedized and durable mobile computing products.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P30_S6	Our sales of this new product may gain customer traction more slowly than anticipated, or not at all, and our profit potential from this new product is uncertain.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P30_S7	The success and profitability of our service offerings are contingent on our ability to differentiate these offerings adequately in the marketplace, which is, in turn, contingent on our ability to retain our engineering personnel and defend our billing rate structure against those of our competitors, including those using significant lower-cost offshore resources.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P30_S8	If we are unable to do so successfully, our business could be harmed.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P30_S9	We are a leader in providing engineering services to customers developing smart devices.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P30_S10	Our market differentiation is created through several factors, including our experience with a variety of smart connected system platforms and applications.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	differentiation is contingent, in part, on our ability to attract and retain employees with this expertise, a significant portion of which are currently based in the United States.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P31_S1	To the extent we are unable to retain critical engineering services talent and/or our competition is able to deliver the same services by using significant lower-cost offshore resources, our service revenue and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P31_S2	The success and profitability of our service engagements are contingent upon our ability to scope and bid engagements and deliver our services profitably.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P31_S3	If we are unable to do so, our service revenue service gross profit margin and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Various factors may cause the total cost of service projects to exceed the original estimate provided to the customer or the contractual maximum in the case of fixed price contracts, including specification changes, customer deliverable delays, inadequate scoping and inefficient service delivery.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P32_S1	If we are unable to adequately scope, bid and deliver on service engagements successfully, our service revenue, service gross margin and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P32_S2	In addition, depending on the cause of an overrun for a given customer and project, we may also decide to provide pricing concessions to that customer which could negatively impact our service revenue, service gross profit and operating results.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We periodically enter into engineering service agreements in which we agree to perform our engineering service work for lower up-front fees, or for no fees, in exchange for future royalties or per unit fees.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P33_S1	There is no guarantee that these arrangements will produce the strategic or economic returns as anticipated.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We have entered into contracts that involve reducing or eliminating up-front engineering service fees in return for a per-device/chip royalty or fee that is earned as devices or chips are shipped by our customers, and we may enter into more such agreements in the future.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Because we are delaying revenue past the point where our services are performed, there is a risk that our customers may cancel their projects or that their devices or chips may not be successful in the market, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Cooperation and support from silicon vendors is critical for the success of our products and related services that are developed for their particular silicon architecture.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P34_S3	We have developed, and continue to develop, software and service offerings based on certain silicon architectures.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Due to the nature of the industry we serve and the products we develop, it is necessary for us to make certain assumptions regarding which silicon vendors will be successful in the various markets we serve and upon which we are making investments.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P34_S5	It is therefore important that there is ongoing support from the SVs in the marketplace for these silicon architectures.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P34_S6	There can be no assurance that TI, Qualcomm, Freescale, Intel or any of the other SVs will continue to pursue and support the markets that we have been targeting.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P34_S7	If the SVs do not support our efforts going forward, our revenue and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P34_S8	The long sales cycle of our products and services makes our revenue susceptible to fluctuations.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P34_S9	Our sales cycle is can run three to twelve months because the expense and complexity of the software and service offerings we sell generally require a lengthy customer approval process and may be subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control, including:
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The timing of customers competitive evaluation processes.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	In addition, to successfully sell our software and engineering service offerings, we must frequently educate our potential customers about the full benefits of our software and services, which can require significant time.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P36_S1	If our sales cycle further lengthens unexpectedly, it could adversely affect the timing of our revenue, which could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Erosion of the financial condition of our customers could adversely affect our business.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Our business could be adversely affected if the financial condition of our customers erodes because such erosion could reduce demand from those customers for our software and engineering services.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P36_S4	This could also cause them to terminate their relationships with us, and/or could increase the risk that such customers default on their payment obligations to us.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P36_S5	Additionally, while we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate, economic trends may cause more companies to default or cease operations, in which case our allowances may not cover actual losses, which could adversely affect our operating results.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Our business and operations would be adversely impacted in the event of a failure or interruption of our information technology infrastructure.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P37_S1	The proper functioning of our information technology infrastructure is critical to the efficient operation and management of our business.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Our technology infrastructure is vulnerable to cyber-attacks, computer viruses, worms and other malicious software programs, physical and electronic break-ins, sabotage and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P37_S3	We believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology infrastructure and our operations from these information technology-related and other potential disruptions.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P37_S4	However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P37_S5	We may be subject to product liability claims that could result in significant costs.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P37_S6	Our software license and service agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P37_S7	It is possible, however, that these provisions may be ineffective under the laws of certain jurisdictions or that our customers may not agree to these limitations.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P37_S8	Although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date, the sale and support of our products and services may be subject to such claims in the future.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P37_S9	There is a risk that any such claims or liabilities may exceed, or fall outside, the scope of our insurance coverage, and we may be unable to retain adequate liability insurance in the future.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P37_S10	A product liability claim brought against us, whether successful or not, could negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P37_S11	Our business and results of operations would be adversely impacted in the event that we incur business losses that are not covered by or exceed our existing business insurance coverage.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P37_S12	We are insured against certain business risks and liabilities under our corporate insurance policies.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P37_S13	However to the extent that we incur losses in connection with our business that are not covered by our existing insurance policies or that exceed our existing policy coverage, our business and results of operations would be adversely impacted.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P37_S14	Negative business conditions, changes in useful lives, and other factors may negatively affect the carrying value of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P37_S15	In the third quarter of 2011, we acquired MPC Data, Ltd. including certain intangible assets with a carrying value of $660,000 and goodwill of $3.7 million as of December 31, 2014.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P37_S16	Although we expect to generate cash from the intangible assets in the future, and do not foresee any impairment of our goodwill, it is possible that we may be required to reassess the carrying value of these assets in the future if certain negative business conditions occur such as negative results of our business associated with our intangible assets or a low stock price.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P37_S17	Any reduction in the carrying value of these intangible assets or goodwill would result in an impairment charge that would negatively impact our operating results.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P37_S18	Further, business conditions and other factors may also require us to reassess the useful lives associated with intangible assets.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P37_S19	Past acquisitions have proven difficult to integrate, and recent or future acquisitions, if any, could disrupt our business, dilute shareholder value and negatively affect our operating results.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We have acquired the technologies, assets and/or operations of other companies in the past and may acquire or make investments in companies, products, services and technologies in the future as part of our growth strategy.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P38_S1	If we fail to properly evaluate, integrate and execute on our acquisitions and investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P38_S2	To successfully complete an acquisition, we must properly evaluate the technology, market and management team, accurately forecast the financial impact of the transaction, including accounting charges and transaction expenses, integrate and retain personnel, combine potentially different corporate cultures and effectively integrate products and research and development, sales, marketing and support operations.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P38_S3	If we fail to do any of these, we may suffer losses and impair relationships with our employees, customers and strategic partners.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Additionally, management may be distracted from day-to-day operations.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P38_S5	We also may be unable to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, which are especially critical in light of requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other corporate governance requirements, and significant demands may be placed on our management and our operations, information services and financial, legal and marketing resources.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P38_S6	Finally, acquired businesses sometimes result in unexpected liabilities and contingencies, which may involve compliance with foreign laws, payment of taxes, labor negotiations or other unknown costs and expenses, which could be significant.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We may not be able to raise additional capital if required to support our business.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P39_S1	If we need to raise additional operating capital, we may find that our access to equity and debt capital markets is limited or blocked entirely.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P39_S2	In the past, our stock has traded at low volumes and overall investor confidence in the stock market could falter.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	could make it difficult or impossible to sell additional shares on the public markets.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P40_S1	In addition, it may be difficult and costly to obtain debt financing and we may be unable to borrow additional funds at acceptable cost, or at all, should the need arise.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P40_S2	If we are unable to raise capital as necessary, it may adversely affect our ability to invest in products or fund operations, which would materially harm our business and negatively affect operating results.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Taxing jurisdictions in the United States are becoming more aggressive with tax legislation and tax collection, particularly states facing significant budget deficits, which could expose us to additional tax liability that we have not been subject to in the past.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P41_S1	We make sales in many jurisdictions across the United States, most of which we do not have nexus in and, therefore, are not subject to sales, franchise, income and other state and local taxes.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Particularly in light of state revenue deficits, taxing jurisdictions have become more aggressive in defining nexus, among other things, which could result in us achieving nexus, or potentially achieving nexus in significantly more tax jurisdictions.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P41_S3	If this occurs and unless we are able to pass through this cost to our customers, our tax expense will increase which will negatively affect our results of operations.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Further, because state and local tax laws are becoming increasingly complex, our cost to monitor our state and local tax compliance will increase which will negatively affect our results of operations.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P41_S5	Additionally, there can be no assurance that we do not currently have unknown tax exposure in a state or local tax jurisdiction because of recent tax law changes which we are unaware of and the resulting liability could be significant and would negatively affect our results of operations.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	There may be restrictions on the use of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards due to a tax law ownership change.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code restricts the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P43_S1	At December 31, 2014, we had approximately $59.7 million of federal and $3.4 million of state net operating loss carryforwards and $2.7 million of tax credit carryforwards.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Under the applicable tax rules, an ownership change occurs if greater than five percent shareholders of an issuer s outstanding common stock collectively increase their ownership percentage by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P44_S1	We have performed analyses of possible ownership changes which included consideration of a third-party study, and do not believe that an ownership change as defined by Section 382 has occurred.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P44_S2	However, if a tax law ownership change has occurred of which we are not aware, or if a tax law ownership change occurs in the future, we may have to adjust the valuation of our deferred tax assets, and could be at risk of having to pay income taxes notwithstanding the existence of our sizable carryforwards.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Further, to the extent that we have utilized our carryforwards from prior years, the existence of a previous tax law ownership change that we did not account for could result in liability for back taxes, interest, and penalties.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P44_S4	If we are unable to utilize our carryforwards and/or if we previously utilized carryforwards to which we were not entitled, it would negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P44_S5	Intellectual Property-Related Risk Factors Our software and service offerings could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which could expose us to additional costs and litigation and could adversely affect our ability to sell our products and services or cause shipment delays or stoppages.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P44_S6	It is difficult to determine whether our software and engineering services infringe third-party intellectual property rights, particularly in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which technologies often overlap and where there may be numerous patent applications pending, many of which are confidential when filed.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P44_S7	If we were to discover that one of our software or service offerings, or a product based on one of our reference designs, violated a third-party s proprietary rights, we may not be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, to continue offering that product or service.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P44_S8	Similarly, third parties may claim that our current or future software products and services infringe their proprietary rights, regardless of whether such claims have merit.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P44_S9	Any such claims could increase our costs and negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	In certain cases, we have been unable to obtain indemnification against claims that third-party technology incorporated into our software products and services infringe the proprietary rights of others.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P45_S1	However, any indemnification we do obtain may be limited in scope or amount.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Even if we receive broad third-party indemnification, these entities may not have the financial capability to indemnify us in the event of infringement.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P45_S3	In addition, in some circumstances we are required to indemnify our customers for claims made against them that are based on our software products or services.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P45_S4	There can be no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims related to the software products and services we provide, or arising from the incorporation by us of third-party technology, and claims for indemnification from our customers resulting from such claims, will not be asserted or prosecuted against us.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P45_S5	Some of our competitors have, or are affiliated, with companies with substantially greater resources than we have, and these competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than we could.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P45_S6	In addition, we expect that software developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the software industry grows, and as the functionality of products in different industry segments increasingly overlap.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P45_S7	Such claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources in addition to potential product redevelopment costs and delays.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	delivering services based on the infringing technology, unless we obtain a license from the holder of the patent or other intellectual property rights.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P46_S1	There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain any such license on commercially favorable terms, or at all.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P46_S2	If such license is not obtained, we would be required to cease these related business operations, which could negatively impact our business, revenue and operating results.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P46_S3	If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may be able to use our technology or trademarks, which could weaken our competitive position, reduce our revenue and increase our costs.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P46_S4	If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, our competitive position could be weakened and our revenue and operating results adversely affected.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P46_S5	We rely primarily on confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions as well as a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, to protect our intellectual property.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P46_S6	These laws and procedures provide only limited protection.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P46_S7	It is possible that another party could obtain patents that block our use of some, or all, of our software and services.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P46_S8	If that occurred, we would need to obtain a license from the patent holder or design around those patents.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P46_S9	The patent holder may or may not choose to make a license available to us at all, or on acceptable terms.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P46_S10	Similarly, it may not be possible to design around a blocking patent.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P46_S11	In general, there can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws will be effective to prevent misappropriation of our technology, or to prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to or competitive with those developed by us.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We frequently license the source code of our software products and the source code results of our services to customers.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P47_S1	There can be no assurance that customers with access to our source code will comply with the license terms or that we will discover any violations of the license terms or, in the event of discovery of violations, that we will be able to successfully enforce the license terms and/or recover the economic value lost from such violations.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P48_S0	To license some of our software products, we rely in part on shrink-wrap and click wrap licenses that are not signed by the end user and, therefore, may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P48_S1	As with other software, our software products are susceptible to unauthorized copying and uses that may go undetected, and policing such unauthorized use is difficult.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P49_S0	A significant portion of our marks include the word BSQUARE.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Other companies use forms of BSQUARE in their marks alone, or in combination with other words, and we cannot prevent all such third-party uses.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We license certain trademark rights to third parties.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Such licensees may not abide by our compliance and quality control guidelines with respect to such trademark rights.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Any of these outcomes could negatively impact our brand, dilute its recognition in the marketplace, or confuse potential customers, all of which could harm our business.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P51_S0	The computer software market is characterized by frequent and substantial intellectual property litigation, which is often complex and expensive, and involves a significant diversion of resources and uncertainty of outcome.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property or to defend against a claim of infringement or invalidity.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Litigation could result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources and could negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Our software or hardware products or the third-party hardware or software integrated with our products or delivered as part of our service offerings may suffer from defects or errors that could impair our ability to sell our products and services.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P51_S4	Software and hardware components as complex as those needed for smart connected systems frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P51_S5	We have had to delay commercial release of certain versions of our products until problems were corrected and, in some cases, have provided product enhancements to correct errors in released products.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P51_S6	Some of our contracts require us to repair or replace products that fail to work.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P51_S7	To the extent that we repair or replace products our expenses may increase.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P51_S8	In addition, it is possible that by the time defects are fixed, the market opportunity may decline which may result in lost revenue.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P51_S9	Moreover, to the extent that we provide increasingly comprehensive products and services, particularly those focused on hardware, and rely on third-party manufacturers and suppliers to manufacture these products, we will be dependent on the ability of third-party manufacturers to correct, identify and prevent manufacturing errors.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P51_S10	Errors that are discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance, diversion of development resources, damage to our reputation and increased service and warranty costs, all of which could negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P51_S11	If we are unable to license key software from third parties, our business could be harmed.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P51_S12	We sometimes integrate third-party software with our proprietary software and engineering service offerings or sell such third-party software offerings on a standalone basis (e.g. Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems under our ODA with Microsoft).
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P51_S13	If our relationships with these third-party software vendors were to deteriorate, or be eliminated in their entirety, we might be unable to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P51_S14	In the event that we are unable to obtain these third-party software offerings, we would be required to develop this technology internally, assuming it was economically or technically feasible, or seek similar software offerings from other third parties assuming there were competing offerings in the marketplace, which could delay or limit our ability to introduce enhancements or new products, or to continue to sell existing products and engineering services, thereby negatively impacting our revenue and operating results.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Governance-Related Risk Factors It might be difficult for a third-party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation, bylaws and Washington law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in the control of us or a change in our management, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Our Board of Directors has the authority under our amended and restated articles of incorporation to issue preferred stock with rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P52_S3	As a result, preferred stock could be issued quickly and easily with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make removal of our management more difficult.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P52_S4	In addition, our Board of Directors is divided into three classes.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P52_S5	The directors in each class serve for three-year terms, one class being elected each year by our shareholders.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P52_S6	This system of electing and removing directors may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company because it generally makes it more difficult for shareholders to replace a majority of our directors.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P52_S7	In addition, Chapter 19 of the Washington Business Corporation Act generally prohibits a target corporation from engaging in certain significant business transactions with a defined acquiring person for a period of five years after the acquisition, unless the transaction or acquisition of shares is approved by a majority of the members of the target corporation s Board of Directors prior to the time of acquisition.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P52_S8	This provision may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of our company.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P52_S9	The existence of these anti-takeover provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P53_S0	International Operations-Related Risk Factors Our international operations expose us to greater intellectual property, management, collections, regulatory and other risks.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Customers outside of North America generated 10% of our total revenue in 2014 and 13% in 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P53_S2	We currently have sizable operations outside of North America in Taiwan and the United Kingdom and also have a minor sales and support presence in Japan.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P53_S3	In 2013, we closed our operations in Korea, China and Germany.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P53_S4	Our international activities and operations expose us to a number of risks, including the following:
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Complex and/or adverse tax laws and/or changes thereto.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P55_S0	The inherent risks of working in a certain highly regulated and/or controlled economies where relationships between company management and government officials is critical to timely processing of approvals required to conduct business.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P56_S0	These risks could have a material adverse effect on the financial and managerial resources required to operate our foreign offices, as well as on our future international revenue, which could negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P56_S1	As our customers seek more cost-effective locations to develop and manufacture their products, particularly overseas locations, our ability to continue to sell these customers our software products and services could be limited, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Due to competitive and other pressures, some of our customers have moved, and others may seek to move, the development and manufacturing of their smart, connected systems to overseas locations, which may limit our ability to sell these customers our software and services.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P56_S3	As an example, under our ODA with Microsoft, we are currently only able to sell Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems to our customers in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean (excluding Cuba), Mexico, the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
1054721_15_ITEM1A_P56_S4	If our customers, or potential customers, move their manufacturing overseas we may be less competitive, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	As of December 31, 2014, our corporate headquarters are located in 24,061 square feet of leased space in a single location in Bellevue, Washington.
1054721_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	The lease term ends in May 2020.
1054721_15_ITEM2_P0_S2	In North America, we also lease office space in San Diego, California; Boston, Massachusetts; and Akron, Ohio.
1054721_15_ITEM2_P0_S3	We lease office space overseas in Tokyo, Japan; Taipei, Taiwan; and Trowbridge, United Kingdom.
1054721_15_ITEM2_P0_S4	Our facilities have sufficient capacity to support our current operational needs as well as short-term growth plans.
1054721_15_ITEM5_P0_S0	Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.
1054721_15_ITEM5_P1_S0	Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol BSQR.
1054721_15_ITEM5_P1_S1	The following table sets forth the high and low closing prices for our common stock for the periods indicated, as reported by the NASDAQ Global Market.
1054721_15_ITEM5_P2_S0	Holders As of January 31, 2015, there were 123 holders of record of our common stock.
1054721_15_ITEM5_P2_S1	Because many shares of our common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of shareholders, we are unable to determine the total number of shareholders represented by these holders of record.
1054721_15_ITEM5_P2_S2	Dividends We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock.
1054721_15_ITEM5_P2_S3	We currently intend to retain any future earnings to fund future development and growth and, therefore, do not anticipate paying any consistent cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1054721_15_ITEM5_P2_S4	Our Board of Directors has, however, periodically considered implementing a share repurchase program and/or a special one-time cash dividend.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations may contain some statements and information which are not historical facts but are forward-looking statements.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P1_S2	Business Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, and Item 1A of Part I, Risk Factors.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	We provide software solutions and related engineering services to companies that develop smart, connected systems.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	A smart, connected system is a dedicated purpose computing device that typically has a display, runs an operating system (e.g., Microsoft Windows Embedded Compact) and is usually connected to a network or data cloud via a wired or wireless connection.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	Examples of smart, connected systems include set-top boxes, home gateways, point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, voting machines, gaming platforms, tablets, handheld data collection devices, personal media players, smart phones, smart vending machines, in-vehicle telematics and entertainment devices.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P3_S2	We primarily focus on smart, connected systems that utilize Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems as well as devices running other popular operating systems such as Android, Linux and QNX.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P3_S3	We have been providing software solutions for smart, connected systems since our inception.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P3_S4	Our customers include world class OEMs, ODMs and Enterprises, as well as SVs and peripheral vendors which purchase our software solutions for purposes of facilitating processor and peripheral sales.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P3_S5	In the case of Enterprises, our customers include those which develop, market and distribute smart, connected systems on their own behalf as well as those that purchase systems from OEMs or ODMs and require additional software, integration and/or testing.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P3_S6	The software solutions we provide are utilized and deployed throughout various phases of our customers device life cycle, including design, development, customization, quality assurance and deployment.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P3_S7	Building on the traditional focus of our business noted above, increasingly we intend to focus on developing and offering our own products such as DataV to address the emerging IoT market.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P3_S8	Similarly, we intend to focus on increasing the amount of our own intellectual property and know-how including in our MobileV product, a complete hardware and software reference solution for OEMs building durable and rugged handhelds and industrial tablets.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	Critical Accounting Judgments Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from software and engineering service sales when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the selling price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	Contracts and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P4_S2	Shipping documents and time records are generally used to verify delivery.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P4_S3	We assess whether the selling price is fixed or determinable based on the contract and/or customer purchase order and payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P4_S4	We assess collectability based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer s payment history.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P4_S5	Periodically, we will begin work on engineering service engagements prior to having a signed contract and, in some cases, the contract is signed in a quarter after which service delivery costs are incurred.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P4_S6	We do not defer costs associated with such engagements before we have received a signed contract.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P4_S7	We recognize software revenue upon shipment provided that no significant obligations remain on our part, substantive acceptance conditions, if any, have been met and the other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	Service revenue from time and materials contracts, and training service agreements, is recognized as services are performed.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	Fixed-price service agreements, and certain time and materials service agreements with capped fee structures, are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method assuming reasonable estimates of completion can be made.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P5_S2	We use the percentage-of-completion method of accounting because we believe it is the most accurate method to recognize revenue based on the nature and scope of these engineering service contracts; we believe it is a better measure of periodic income results than other methods and better matches revenue recognized with the costs incurred.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P5_S3	Percentage of completion is measured based primarily on input measures such as hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P5_S4	Significant judgment is required when estimating total hours and progress to completion on these arrangements which determines the amount of revenue we recognize as well as whether a loss is recognized if one is expected to be incurred for the remainder of the project.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	Revisions to hour and cost estimates are incorporated in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	In certain situations when it is impractical for us to reliably estimate either specific amounts or ranges of contract revenues and costs, and where we anticipate that we will not incur a loss, a zero profit model is used for revenue recognition.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	Equal amounts of revenue and cost are recognized during the contract period, and profit is recognized when the project is completed and accepted.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	method was used in 2013 and 2014 for two engineering service contracts in Japan.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	The contracts were completed and accepted in the second and fourth quarters of 2014 and the profit from these contracts was recognized in 2014.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	We also enter into arrangements in which a customer purchases a combination of software licenses, engineering services and post-contract customer support and/or maintenance ( PCS ).
1054721_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	As a result, contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting, including how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements if there are multiple elements.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	PCS may include rights to upgrades, when and if available, telephone support, updates and enhancements.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	When vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) of fair value exists for all elements in a multiple element arrangement, revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each of the elements.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	VSOE of fair value is established by the price charged when the same element is sold separately.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	Accordingly, the judgments involved in assessing the fair values of various elements of an agreement can impact the recognition of revenue in each period.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P11_S3	Changes in the allocation of the sales price between deliverables might impact the timing of revenue recognition, but would not change the total revenue recognized on the contract.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	When elements such as software and engineering services are contained in a single arrangement, or in related arrangements with the same customer, we allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value, provided that such element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	In the absence of fair value for a delivered element, revenue is first allocated to the fair value of the undelivered elements and then allocated to the residual delivered elements.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P12_S2	In the absence of fair value for an undelivered element, the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting, resulting in a delay of revenue recognition for the delivered elements until the undelivered elements are fulfilled.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	When engineering services and royalties are contained in a single arrangement, we recognize revenue from engineering services as earned in accordance with the criteria above even though the effective rate per hour may be lower than typical because the customer is contractually obligated to pay royalties on their device shipments.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	We recognize royalty revenue, classified as software revenue, when the royalty report from the customer is received or when such royalties are contractually guaranteed and the other revenue recognition criteria are met, particularly that collectability is reasonably assured.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P13_S2	There are two items involving revenue recognition that require us to make more difficult and subjective judgments: the determination of VSOE of fair value in multiple element arrangements and the estimation of percentage of completion on fixed-price service contracts.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	Historically, we have entered into very few multiple-element arrangements other than those involving the sale of PCS related to our TestQuest automated testing tools.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	We establish VSOE of fair value for TestQuest PCS based on the price when PCS is sold separately.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	VSOE of TestQuest PCS has been well established in the past as these products have been sold on a stand-alone basis for a number of years even prior to our acquisition of TestQuest assets in November 2008.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	We measure our estimate of completion on fixed-price contracts, which in turn determines the amount of revenue we recognize, based primarily on actual hours incurred to date and our estimate of remaining hours necessary to complete the contract.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	The process of estimating the remaining hours on a contract involves detailed estimates of remaining hours by the engineers and project managers involved with the project, factoring in such variables as the remaining tasks, the complexity of the tasks, the contracted quality of the software to be provided, the customer s estimated delivery date, integration of third-party software and quality thereof and other factors.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	Every fixed-price contract requires various approvals within our company, including our Chief Executive Officer if significant.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	This approval process takes into consideration a number of factors including the complexity of engineering.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	Historically, our estimation processes related to fixed-price contracts have been accurate based on the information known at the time of the reporting of our results.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	However, percentage-of-completion estimates require significant judgment.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	As of December 31, 2014, we were delivering engineering services under seven fixed-price service contracts.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	The percentage of completion calculations on these contracts represents management s best estimates based on the facts and circumstances as of the filing of this report.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P20_S2	If there are changes to the underlying facts and circumstances, revisions to the percentage-of-completion calculations will be recorded in the period the changes are noted.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P20_S3	For illustrative purposes only, if we were 10% under in our estimates of completion on every fixed-bid contract active on December 31, 2014, our revenue would have been over-stated by approximately $358,000 for 2014.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	We evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	Our intangible assets were acquired through business acquisitions.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	Our intangible assets consist of customer relationships.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	Factors that could trigger an impairment analysis include significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	If this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired, we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	If this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining useful life, we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P24_S2	Any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P24_S3	We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P24_S4	Our annual testing date is December 31.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	If it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount, further testing of impairment is not performed.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	If it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, we perform a quantitative two-step impairment test.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	Our stock-based compensation expense for stock options is estimated at the grant date based on the stock award s fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton ( BSM ) option-pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	The BSM model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and option life.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P27_S2	If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	Restricted stock units ( RSUs ) and restricted stock awards ( RSAs ) are measured based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant as determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience and expected future activity.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	To the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimates, stock-based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	Incentive Compensation We make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions regarding the likelihood of attainment, and the level thereof, of bonuses payable under our annual incentive compensation programs.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	We accrue bonuses and recognize the resulting expense when the bonus is judged to be reasonably likely to be earned as of year-end and is estimable.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P30_S2	The amount accrued, and expense recognized, is the estimated portion of the bonus earned on a year-to-date basis less any amounts previously accrued.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P30_S3	These estimates, judgments and assumptions are made quarterly based on available information and take into consideration our year-to-date actual results and expected results for the remainder of the year.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P30_S4	Because we consider estimated future results in assessing the likelihood of attainment, significant judgment is required.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P30_S5	If actual results differ materially from our estimates, the amount of bonus expense recorded in a particular quarter could be significantly over or under estimated.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the countries and other jurisdictions in which we operate.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	This process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P31_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P31_S3	Net operating losses and tax credits, to the extent not already utilized to offset taxable income or income taxes, also give rise to deferred tax assets.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P31_S4	We must then assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income, and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P31_S5	Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	We estimate the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	Our sales may be subject to other taxes, particularly withholding taxes, due to our sales to customers in countries other than the United States.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P32_S2	The tax regulations governing withholding taxes are complex, causing us to have to make assumptions about the appropriate tax treatment.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P32_S3	Further, we make sales in many jurisdictions across the United States, where tax regulations are varied and complex.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P32_S4	We must therefore continue to analyze our state tax exposure and determine what the appropriate tax treatments are, and make estimates for sales, franchise, income and other state taxes.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	The following table presents certain financial data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	Our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	Our revenue is generated from the sale of software, both our own proprietary software and third-party software that we resell, and the sale of engineering services.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	Total revenue increased $3.8 million, or 4%, to $95.9 million in 2014 from $92.1 million in 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P35_S2	This increase was driven by higher sales of Windows Embedded operating systems, and an increase in engineering services revenue, partially offset by a decline in proprietary software revenue.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P35_S3	One customer, Future Electronics, Inc. accounted for 12% of total revenues in 2014.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P35_S4	No other customers accounted for 10% or more of total revenue in either 2014 or 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P35_S5	Revenue from our customers outside of North America decreased $1.7 million, or 14%, to $10.0 million in 2014, from $11.7 million in 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P35_S6	Revenue from our customers outside of North America represented 10% of our total revenue in 2014, compared to 13% in 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P35_S7	The decrease in non-North American revenue in 2014 was primarily attributable to lower sales of Windows Mobile operating systems in Asia, lower engineering services revenue and lower proprietary software sales in Asia .
1054721_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	Software revenue Software revenue consists of sales of third-party software and revenue realized from our own proprietary software products, which include software license sales, royalties from our software products, support and maintenance revenue, and royalties from certain engineering service contracts.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P36_S1	Software revenue for 2014 and 2013 was as follows (dollars in thousands):
1054721_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	The vast majority of our third-party software revenue is comprised of sales of Microsoft Embedded software and Windows Mobile operating systems.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	Third-party software revenue increased $3.0 million, or 4%, in 2014 compared to the prior year.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	increase in third-party software revenue was driven primarily by an increase in Microsoft Windows Embedded software sales as well two significant sales of our new MobileV products totaling $1.0 million, partially offset by decreases in Windows Mobile sales as well as sales of Adobe Flash which had a significant sale in Q4 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	Proprietary software revenue decreased $0.2 million, or 8%, in 2014 compared to 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P38_S2	This was driven by the continued decline in sales of legacy products.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P38_S3	Service revenue Service revenue for 2014 and 2013 was as follows (dollars in thousands):
1054721_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	Service revenue increased $1.0 million, or 5%, in 2014 compared to the prior year.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	This increase was due to increases in service revenue generated in both Asia and EMEA offset partially by a decline in North America service revenue.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P39_S2	The increase in Asia was driven by the completion of two large handheld programs.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P39_S3	Both programs were accounted for under the zero profit percentage of completion accounting method in which we recognized revenue during the project equal to our cost and recognize the remaining revenue, equal to the gross profit on the program, at completion.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P39_S4	One of the programs was completed during the three months ended June 30, 2014 while the other was completed during the three months ended December 31, 2014.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P39_S5	The decrease in North America service revenue was driven largely by a $1.7 million decrease associated with the MyFord Touch Program offset partially by increases from our existing customer base and the acquisition of new customers.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P39_S6	Microsoft became our largest engineering services customer during the first quarter of 2012, replacing Ford Motor Company ( Ford ), as Microsoft replaced Ford as the invoiced customer on the MyFord Touch program.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P39_S7	We continue to work on the MyFord Touch, a project we began with Ford during the second quarter of 2008; however, we now conduct these services through an agreement with Microsoft.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P39_S8	During the initial project with Ford, we provided hardware design and implementation, platform level software development, application level software development, quality assurance services and systems integration services.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P39_S9	The project has transitioned since the initial project such that we are now primarily focused on developing and integrating new user applications for the MyFord Touch, enhancing existing applications and customizing the MyFord Touch platform for additional vehicle models.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	The MyFord Touch program contributed $2.8 million in service revenue in 2014 compared to $4.5 million in 2013, representing a decline of $1.7 million or 38%.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	The decrease is attributable to a reduction in the number of engineers working on the MyFord Touch project as the amount of work on the increasingly mature platform has declined.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P40_S2	In December 2014, Ford introduced Sync 3, the next generation MyFord Touch program that is scheduled to be deployed on cars in 2016 and will be based on QNX software from Blackberry instead of software from Microsoft.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P40_S3	While we expect to be actively involved in current generation MyFord Touch projects with Microsoft, Ford and Elektrobit through 2015 and beyond, we expect our role on MyFord Touch will be scaled back or eliminated because of the transition to QNX software for the next generation Sync 3 and our revenue and resulting gross profit will decline accordingly.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	Gross profit and gross margin Cost of software revenue consists primarily of the cost of third-party software products payable to third-party vendors and support costs associated with our proprietary software products.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	Cost of service revenue consists primarily of salaries and benefits, contractor costs and re-billable expenses, related facilities and depreciation costs, and amortization of certain intangible assets related to acquisitions.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P41_S2	Gross profit on the sale of third-party software products is also positively impacted by rebate credits we receive from Microsoft for embedded software sales earned through the achievement of defined objectives.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P41_S3	Prior to the third quarter of 2013, the earned rebate amount was treated as a reduction in software cost of sales in the quarter earned.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P41_S4	Beginning in the third quarter of 2013, as a result of program modifications, we began treating a portion of the rebate as marketing development funds which are accounted for as a reduction in marketing expense if and when qualified program expenditures are made.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P41_S5	Under this rebate program, we recognized $298,000 of rebate credits in 2014 and $744,000 in 2013, which were treated as reductions in cost of sales.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P41_S6	Additionally, during 2014 we qualified for $685,000 in rebate credits which will be accounted for as a reduction in marketing expense if and when qualified expenditures are made.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	The following table outlines software, services and total gross profit (dollars in thousands):
1054721_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	Software gross profit and gross margin Software gross profit decreased by $1.2 million, or 9%, in 2014 compared to 2013, while software gross margin decreased by three percentage points from 18% in 2013 to 15% in 2014.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P43_S1	Third-party software gross margin was 14% in 2014, compared to 16% in 2013 driven primarily by a heavier concentration of sales of the lower margin product line of Microsoft Embedded software and lower rebates in 2014, as well as a large Adobe Flash sale in the fourth quarter of 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P43_S2	Proprietary software gross margin was 75% in 2014 compared to 66% in 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P43_S3	Although proprietary software revenue decreased by 8%, margins improved as a result of a decrease in the relatively fixed software cost of sales due in part to the cost reductions in the fourth quarter of 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P43_S4	Service gross profit and gross margin Service gross profit increased $2.7 million, or 132%, in 2014 compared to 2013 driven by a $1.0 million increase in service revenue combined with a $1.7 million decrease in service cost of sales.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P43_S5	Service gross margin was 24% in 2014, a 13 percentage point increase from 11% in 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P43_S6	The decrease in service cost of sales was driven primarily by an improvement in utilization made possible by our cost reduction effort in the fourth quarter of 2013 to better align our service cost base with anticipated revenue which included the closure of our Beijing, China delivery center.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P43_S7	Service gross profit also benefited from the recognition of $478,000 of gross profit on the previously mentioned service project completed in Japan in the second quarter of 2014 as well as the $598,000 of gross profit on the other previously mentioned service project completed in Japan in the fourth quarter of 2014.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P43_S8	These two completed projects, with recognized profit in 2014, added approximately 2% to the reported 2014 gross margin with a similar reduction in 2013 margins.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	Operating expenses Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, commissions and bonuses for our sales, marketing and administrative personnel and related facilities and depreciation costs, as well as professional services fees (e.g., consulting, legal, audit and tax).
1054721_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $3.0 million, or 20%, to $12.4 million in 2014, from $15.4 million in 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P44_S2	The decrease was driven by our cost reduction effort in the fourth quarter of 2013 as well as severance and related costs associated with the departure of our former Chief Executive Officer in September 2013 and the departure of our former Senior Vice President of Worldwide Sales and Marketing in December 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P44_S3	Selling, general and administrative expenses represented 13% of our total revenue in 2014 compared to 17% of revenue in 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P44_S4	Research and development Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for software development and quality assurance personnel, contractor and consultant costs and related facilities and depreciation costs.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P44_S5	Research and development expenses decreased $1.1 million, or 39%, to $1.7 million in 2014, from $2.8 million in 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P44_S6	The decrease was driven largely by our cost reduction efforts in the fourth quarter of 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P44_S7	Research and development expenses represented 2% of total revenue in 2014 and 3% in 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	Other income (expense), net Other income (expense) consists of interest income on our cash and investments, gains and losses we may recognize on our investments, gains or losses on foreign exchange transactions and other items.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	Net other expense was $101,000 in 2014 compared to net other income of $40,000 in 2013, representing a decrease of $141,000.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P45_S2	This change was driven primarily by losses on foreign currency transactions in 2014 compared to gains on such transactions in 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	Income taxes Income tax expense was $38,000 in 2014, based on income before income taxes of $2.4 million.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P46_S1	Our effective tax rate in 2014 was 1.6%, which is below the statutory rate of 34%, primarily due to the full valuation allowance on U.S. deferred tax assets.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P46_S2	Income tax expense was $2.2 million in 2013, based on loss before income taxes of $3.1 million.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P46_S3	Although we recognized a loss before income taxes in 2013, we did not recognize a tax benefit due to an income tax charge in the third quarter of 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P46_S4	We determined that it was not more likely than not that we would generate sufficient future taxable income to use our U.S. deferred tax assets.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P46_S5	As a result, we increased our deferred tax asset valuation allowance by $2.2 million.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P46_S6	Deferred tax assets relative to our foreign jurisdictions were not affected.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P46_S7	The factors we considered in recording a full valuation allowance on our US deferred tax assets included, among other things, our recent history of losses and the uncertainty regarding generation of future taxable income.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P46_S8	Restructuring During the fourth quarter of 2013, we effected a restructuring that included a workforce reduction and the closure of our offices in Beijing, China and Munich, Germany.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P46_S9	The workforce reduction impacted approximately 20% of our worldwide workforce.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P46_S10	The restructuring was intended to better align our organizational structure with our strategic focus.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P46_S11	The staff reductions and office closures were substantially completed by the end of the fourth quarter of 2013 with some activities, including completing certain legal entity closures, continuing into early 2015.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P46_S12	The results of this restructuring and associated asset impairment were recorded within loss from operations on our Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) .
1054721_15_ITEM7_P46_S13	See Note 12: 2013 Restructuring in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P46_S14	Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2014, we had $26.6 million of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash, compared to $21.1 million at December 31, 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P46_S15	Of these amounts, $13.1 million and $13.5 million were classified as cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively, Restricted cash is classified as long term and was $250,000 at both December 31, 2014 and 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P46_S16	This cash is restricted under the terms of our headquarters operating lease which will continue to secure that obligation through its expiration in 2020.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P46_S17	Our working capital was $23.7 million at December 31, 2014, compared to $19.8 million at December 31, 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P46_S18	Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.3 million in 2014, driven by our net income of $2.3 million, positive net working capital changes of $1.4 million and non-cash expenses of $1.6 million.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P46_S19	Net cash provided by operating activities was $619,000 in 2013, driven by positive net working capital changes of $2.1 million and non-cash expenses of $3.8 million, offset by our net loss of $5.3 million.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P46_S20	Net cash used by investing activities was $6.3 million in 2014, due primarily to purchases of short-term investments exceeding proceeds from maturities of short-term investments by approximately $6.0 million and fixed asset purchases of $0.3 million.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P46_S21	Investing activities provided net cash of $3.0 million in 2013, due primarily to net proceeds of short-term investments of $2.5 million and a $625,000 reduction in restricted cash under the terms of our corporate headquarters lease amendment executed in August 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P46_S22	Financing activities generated $666,000 in 2014 and $51,000 in 2013 as a result of the exercise of employee stock options.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments will be sufficient to meet our needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	Cash Commitments We have the following future or potential cash commitments:
1054721_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	In conjunction with our activities under our ODAs with Microsoft, we enter OVRP commitments with Microsoft.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P48_S1	Under these OVRPs, we are provided with volume pricing on a customer-by-customer basis assuming certain minimum unit volumes are met.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P48_S2	The OVRP terms are 12 months.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P48_S3	In the event we don t meet the committed minimum unit volumes, we are obligated to pay the difference between the committed per-unit volume rate and the actual per-unit rate we achieved based upon actual units purchased.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P48_S4	The OVRP arrangements do not equate to a minimum purchase commitment but rather, the arrangements are a volume pricing arrangement based upon actual volume purchased.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	to the amounts we would subsequently owe to Microsoft if such OVRP volumes are not met.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	However, in the event a customer is unwilling or unable to pay us, we would be negatively impacted.
1054721_15_ITEM7_P49_S2	Based upon the credit-worthiness of our customers, our historical OVRP experience with our customers and OVRP arrangements in general, we do not believe we will incur any material liability in the current or future periods.
1054721_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BSQUARE Corporation (the Corporation ) as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), shareholders equity and cash flows for the years then ended.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P0_S1	These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation s management.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P0_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1054721_15_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P1_S2	The Corporation is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P1_S3	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P1_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P2_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of BSQUARE Corporation as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1054721_15_ITEM8_P8_S0	Description of Business BSQUARE Corporation ( Bsquare ) was incorporated in Washington State in July 1994.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P8_S1	We provide software solutions and related engineering services to companies that develop smart, connected systems.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P9_S0	A smart, connected system is a dedicated purpose computing device that typically has a display, runs an operating system (e.g., Microsoft Windows CE) and is usually connected to a network or data cloud via a wired or wireless connection.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P9_S1	Examples of smart, connected systems include set-top boxes, home gateways, point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, voting machines, gaming platforms, tablets, handheld data collection devices, personal media players, smart phones, smart vending machines and in-vehicle telematics and entertainment devices.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P9_S2	We focus on smart, connected systems that utilize Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems as well as devices running other popular operating systems such as Android, Linux, and QNX.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P9_S3	We have been providing software solutions for smart, connected systems since our inception.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P9_S4	Our customers include world class original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ), original design manufacturers ( ODMs ) and corporate enterprises ( Enterprises ), as well as silicon vendors ( SVs ) and peripheral vendors which purchase our software solutions for purposes of facilitating processor and peripheral sales.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P9_S5	In the case of Enterprises, our customers include those which develop, market and distribute smart, connected systems on their own behalf as well as those that purchase systems from OEMs or ODMs and require additional software, integration and/or testing.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P9_S6	The software solutions we provide are utilized and deployed throughout various phases of our customers device life cycle, including design, development, customization, quality assurance and deployment.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P10_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of BSQUARE Corporation and our wholly owned subsidiaries.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P10_S1	All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P11_S0	Use of Estimates Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P11_S1	Examples include provisions for bad debts and income taxes, estimates of progress on professional engineering service arrangements, bonus accruals, fair value of intangible assets and property and equipment, fair values of stock-based awards and the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities, among other estimates.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P11_S2	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P12_S0	Basic income or loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, and excludes any dilutive effects of common stock equivalent shares, such as options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and warrants.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P12_S1	Restricted stock awards ( RSAs ) are considered outstanding and included in the computation of basic income or loss per share when underlying restrictions expire and the awards are no longer forfeitable.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P12_S2	Restricted stock units ( RSUs ) are considered outstanding and included in the computation of basic income or loss per share only when vested.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P12_S3	Diluted income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P12_S4	Common stock equivalent shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is anti-dilutive.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P12_S5	Unvested but outstanding RSUs and RSAs (which are forfeitable) are included in the diluted income per share calculation.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P13_S0	In a period where we are in a net loss position, the diluted loss per share is computed using the basic share count.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P13_S1	The following table presents a reconciliation of the number of shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted income (loss) per share (in thousands):
1054721_15_ITEM8_P14_S0	Common stock equivalent shares of 901,069 and 990,831 were excluded from the computations of basic and diluted income per share for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, because their effect was anti-dilutive.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P15_S0	Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments We invest our excess cash primarily in highly liquid debt instruments of U.S. government agencies and municipalities, debt instruments issued by foreign governments, corporate commercial paper, money market funds, and corporate debt securities.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P15_S1	We classify all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months as short-term investments.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P15_S2	Short-term investments consist entirely of marketable securities which are all classified as available-for-sale securities and are recorded at their estimated fair value.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P15_S3	We determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P15_S4	We may or may not hold securities with stated maturities greater than 12 months until maturity.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P15_S5	As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify securities with maturities beyond 12 months as short-term investments.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P15_S6	We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of stockholders equity, except for unrealized losses determined to be other than temporary which are recorded in other expense.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P16_S0	Restricted Cash Our restricted cash represents funds held at a financial institution as security for an outstanding letter of credit expiring in 2020 related to our corporate headquarters lease obligation.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P17_S0	Financial Instruments and Concentrations of Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts receivable.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P18_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We record accounts receivable at the invoiced amount net of an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P18_S1	We review customers which are past due to identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P18_S2	In determining the amount of the allowance, we make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P19_S0	Equipment, Furniture and Leasehold Improvements We account for equipment, furniture and leasehold improvements at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P19_S1	We compute depreciation of equipment and furniture using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three years.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P20_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful lives, ranging from two to ten years.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P20_S1	Maintenance and repairs costs are expensed as incurred.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P21_S0	When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, gains or losses are included in the statement of operations.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P22_S0	When facts and circumstances indicate that the value of long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying value of the asset to projected undiscounted future cash flows.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P22_S1	Upon indication that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss as a charge against current operations based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P23_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets were recorded as a result of business acquisitions and are stated at estimated fair value at the time of acquisition less accumulated amortization.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P24_S0	We amortize our acquired intangible assets using the straight-line method using lives ranging from one to ten years.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P25_S0	We review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P25_S1	We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P26_S0	If intangible assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P27_S0	Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P27_S1	We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P27_S2	If it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount, no further testing is performed.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P28_S0	If it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, we perform a quantitative two-step impairment test.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P29_S0	step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P29_S1	If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P30_S0	We record all fees payable and accrued liabilities related to the sale of third-party software, such as Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, as third-party software fees payable.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P31_S0	Research and Development Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P32_S0	Advertising Costs All costs of advertising, including cooperative marketing arrangements, are expensed as incurred.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P32_S1	Advertising expense was $558,000 in 2014 and $501,000 in 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P33_S0	The estimated fair value of stock based awards is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the award, net of estimated forfeitures.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P34_S0	We estimate forfeitures of stock based awards based on historical experience and expected future activity.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P34_S1	The fair value of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P34_S2	The fair value of stock option awards are estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of each vesting tranche as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton ( BSM ) option-pricing model.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P34_S3	The BSM model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and option life.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P34_S4	If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P35_S0	Comprehensive Income (Loss) Comprehensive income (loss) refers to net income (loss) and other revenue, expenses, gains and losses that, under generally accepted accounting principles, are recorded as an element of shareholders equity but are excluded from the calculation of net income (loss).
1054721_15_ITEM8_P36_S0	Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P36_S1	Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P37_S0	We compute income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred income taxes are provided for on the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P37_S1	Our deferred tax amounts are measured using currently enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P37_S2	A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P38_S0	We recognize tax benefits from an uncertain position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based on its technical merits.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P38_S1	The tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P38_S2	Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are classified in the consolidated financial statements as income tax expense.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P39_S0	The functional currency of foreign subsidiaries is their local currency.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P39_S1	Accordingly, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P39_S2	Resulting translation adjustments are included in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss , a separate component of shareholders equity.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P40_S0	The net gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are recorded in the period incurred and were not significant for any of the periods presented.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P41_S0	Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from software and engineering service sales when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the selling price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P41_S1	Contracts and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P41_S2	Shipping documents and time records are generally used to verify delivery.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P41_S3	We assess whether the selling price is fixed or determinable based on the contract and/or customer purchase order and payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P42_S0	creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer s payment history.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P43_S0	Periodically, we will begin work on engineering service engagements prior to having a signed contract and, in some cases, the contract is signed in a quarter after which service delivery costs are incurred.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P43_S1	We do not defer costs associated with such engagements before we have received a signed contract.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P43_S2	We recognize software revenue upon shipment provided that no significant obligations remain on our part, substantive acceptance conditions, if any, have been met and the other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P44_S0	Service revenue from time and materials contracts, and training service agreements, is recognized as services are performed.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P44_S1	Fixed-price service agreements, and certain time and materials service agreements with capped fee structures, are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method assuming reasonable estimates of completion can be made.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P45_S0	We use the percentage-of-completion method of accounting because we believe it is the most accurate method to recognize revenue based on the nature and scope of these engineering service contracts; we believe it is a better measure of periodic income results than other methods and it better matches revenue recognized with the costs incurred.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P45_S1	Percentage of completion is measured based primarily on input measures such as hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P45_S2	Significant judgment is required when estimating total hours and progress to completion on these arrangements which determines the amount of revenue we recognize as well as whether a loss is recognized if one is expected to be incurred for the remainder of the project.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P46_S0	Revisions to hour and cost estimates are incorporated in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P47_S0	In certain situations when it is impractical for us to reliably estimate either specific amounts or ranges of contract revenues and costs, and where we anticipate that we will not incur a loss, a zero profit model is used for revenue recognition.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P47_S1	Equal amounts of revenue and cost are recognized during the contract period, and profit is recognized when the project is completed and accepted.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P47_S2	This method was used in 2013 and 2014 for two engineering service contracts in Japan.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P48_S0	We also enter into arrangements in which a customer purchases a combination of software licenses, engineering services and post-contract customer support and/or maintenance ( PCS ).
1054721_15_ITEM8_P48_S1	As a result, judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting, including how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements if there are multiple elements.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P49_S0	PCS may include rights to upgrades, when and if available, telephone support, updates and enhancements.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P50_S0	When vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) of fair value exists for all elements in a multiple element arrangement, revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each of the elements.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P50_S1	VSOE of fair value is established by the price charged when the same element is sold separately.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P50_S2	Accordingly, the judgments involved in assessing the fair values of various elements of an agreement can impact the recognition of revenue in each period.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P50_S3	Changes in the allocation of the sales price between deliverables might impact the timing of revenue recognition, but would not change the total revenue recognized on the contract.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P51_S0	When elements such as software and engineering services are contained in a single arrangement, or in related arrangements with the same customer, we allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value, provided that such element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P51_S1	In the absence of fair value for a delivered element, revenue is first allocated to the fair value of the undelivered elements and then allocated to the residual delivered elements.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P51_S2	In the absence of fair value for an undelivered element, the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting, resulting in a delay of revenue recognition for the delivered elements until the undelivered elements are fulfilled.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P52_S0	When engineering services and royalties are contained in a single arrangement, we recognize revenue from engineering services as earned in accordance with the criteria above even though the effective rate per hour may be lower than typical because the customer is contractually obligated to pay royalties on their device shipments.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P52_S1	We recognize royalty revenue, classified as software revenue, when the royalty report from the customer is received or when such royalties are contractually guaranteed and the other revenue recognition criteria are met, particularly the criteria that collectability is reasonably assured.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P53_S0	No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , amending revenue recognition guidance and requiring more detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P53_S1	The guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption prohibited.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P53_S2	We are currently evaluating the impact this ASU may have on our consolidated financial statements.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P54_S0	In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P54_S1	The new guidance requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period is treated as a performance condition.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P54_S2	As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant date fair value of the award.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P54_S3	The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P54_S4	We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P55_S0	In August 2014 the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, requiring management to evaluate whether there is a substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related disclosures in the notes to the financial statements.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P55_S1	The new guidance reduces diversity in the timing and content of disclosures from current guidance, and is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 with early adoption permitted.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P55_S2	We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P56_S0	In January 2015 the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01, Income Statement Extraordinary and Unusual Items, eliminating the concept of an extraordinary item from U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ).
1054721_15_ITEM8_P56_S1	As a result, an entity will no longer be required to segregate extraordinary items from the results of ordinary operations, to separately present an extraordinary item on its income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations or to disclose income taxes and earnings-per-share data applicable to an extraordinary item.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P56_S2	However, ASU 2015-01 retains the presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature and occur infrequently.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P56_S3	The new guidance will be effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 1, 2016.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P56_S4	We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P57_S0	Cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash consist of the following (in thousands):
1054721_15_ITEM8_P58_S0	Gross unrealized gains and losses on our cash equivalents and short-term investments were not material as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P58_S1	Our restricted cash balance at December 31, 2014 and 2013 relates to a letter of credit securing the lease of our corporate headquarters.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P59_S0	We measure our cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash at fair value.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P60_S0	Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P60_S1	As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P60_S2	A three-tier fair value hierarchy is established as a basis for considering such assumptions and for inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:
1054721_15_ITEM8_P61_S0	Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P62_S0	Directly or indirectly observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs used in models or other valuation methodologies.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P63_S0	Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P63_S1	The inputs require significant management judgment or estimation.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P64_S0	We classify our cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash within Level 1 or Level 2.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P64_S1	This is because we value these items using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs that are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including third-party pricing services, brokers and market transactions.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P64_S2	We review the pricing techniques and methodologies of the independent pricing service for Level 2 investments and believe that the policies adequately consider market activity, either based on specific transactions for the security valued or based on modeling of securities with similar credit quality, duration, yield and structure that were recently traded.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P65_S0	Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in thousands):
1054721_15_ITEM8_P66_S0	Equipment, Furniture and Leasehold Improvements Equipment, furniture, and leasehold improvements consist of the following (in thousands):
1054721_15_ITEM8_P67_S0	Depreciation and amortization expense of equipment, furniture and leasehold improvements was $491,000 in 2014 and $495,000 in 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P67_S1	We wrote off approximately $1.3 million of assets with remaining net book value of $33,000 in 2014, and $1.4 million of fully depreciated assets in 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P68_S0	Goodwill was recorded in connection with the September 2011 acquisition of MPC Data, Ltd. ( MPC ), a United Kingdom based provider of software engineering services.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P68_S1	The excess of the acquisition consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P69_S0	Bsquare operates as a single reporting unit, and MPC falls within that reporting unit.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P69_S1	There was no change in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P70_S0	Intangible assets relate to customer relationships that we acquired from TestQuest Inc. in November 2008 and from the acquisition of MPC in September 2011.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P70_S1	Information regarding our intangible assets is as follows (in thousands):
1054721_15_ITEM8_P71_S0	Amortization expense was $134,000 and $206,000 for 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P71_S1	As of December 31, 2014, expected amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets for each of the next five years and thereafter is as follows (in thousands):
1054721_15_ITEM8_P72_S0	The components of other income, net are as follows (in thousands):
1054721_15_ITEM8_P73_S0	Income (loss) before income taxes consists of the following (in thousands):
1054721_15_ITEM8_P74_S0	Income tax expense (benefit) consists of the following (in thousands):
1054721_15_ITEM8_P75_S0	The components of net deferred tax assets consist of the following (in thousands):
1054721_15_ITEM8_P76_S0	Our net deferred tax assets are recorded as follows (in thousands):
1054721_15_ITEM8_P77_S0	As of December 31, 2014, our deferred tax assets were primarily the result of U.S. net operating loss and R D credit carryforwards.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P77_S1	Valuation allowances of $26.8 million and $27.7 million have been recorded against our gross deferred tax asset balance as of December 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P78_S0	The provision for income taxes differs from the amount of expected income tax expense (benefit) determined by applying the applicable U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to pre-tax income (loss), as a result of the following (in thousands, except percentages):
1054721_15_ITEM8_P79_S0	At December 31, 2014, we had approximately $59.7 million of federal and $3.4 million of state net operating loss carryforwards, which have begun to expire, including $0.3 million of state losses which will expire in 2015.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P79_S1	Of the federal net operating loss carryforwards, an aggregate of $41.8 million will expire in 2022 and 2023.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P79_S2	We also have $2.7 million of Research and Development ( R D ) credit carryforwards, which begin to expire in 2018.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P79_S3	Use of these carryforwards may subject us to an annual limitation due to Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code which restricts the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use its carryforwards.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P80_S0	Under the applicable tax rules, an ownership change occurs if holders of more than five percent of an issuer s outstanding common stock, collectively, increase their ownership percentage by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P80_S1	We periodically perform analyses of possible ownership changes, including consideration of third party studies, and do not believe that an ownership change of more than 50 percentage points has occurred based upon the latest study completed as of December 31, 2014.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P80_S2	We have evaluated all the material income tax positions taken on our income tax filings to various tax authorities, and we determined that we did not have unrealized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions recorded at December 31, 2014 or 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P80_S3	Because of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, substantially all of our tax years remain open and subject to examination.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P81_S0	Contingencies A third party software vendor has invoiced us a total of $934,000 for certain licensed software that was lost in transit by a common carrier.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P81_S1	Although these licenses have been deactivated and there is no indication of counterfeit use, the vendor has asserted that we are financially responsible for these lost licenses and therefore must pay the full royalty value.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P81_S2	We believe that we have contractual defenses and insurance that would cover losses in excess of $100,000.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P81_S3	We have accrued a liability of $100,000, but have made no provision for losses in excess of this amount since we do not believe that this liability is probable.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P81_S4	Our commitments include obligations outstanding under operating leases, which expire through 2020.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P81_S5	We have lease commitments for office space in Bellevue, Washington; Taipei, Taiwan; Trowbridge, UK; and Tokyo, Japan.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P81_S6	We also lease office space on a month-to-month basis in Akron, Ohio, San Diego, California and Boston, Massachusetts.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P81_S7	In August 2013, we amended the lease agreement for our Bellevue, Washington headquarters and extended the term of the original lease that was scheduled to expire in August 2014 to May 2020.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P81_S8	Rent expense was $1.2 million in 2014 and $1.6 million in 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P81_S9	As of December 31, 2014, we had $250,000 pledged as collateral for a bank letter of credit under the terms of our headquarters facility lease.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P81_S10	The pledged cash supporting the outstanding letter of credit is recorded as restricted cash.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P82_S0	Operating lease commitments at December 31, 2014 are as follows (in thousands):
1054721_15_ITEM8_P83_S0	Volume Pricing Agreements In conjunction with our activities under the OEM Distribution Agreements ( ODAs ) with Microsoft Corporation ( Microsoft ), we enter into OEM Volume Royalty Pricing ( OVRP ) commitments with Microsoft.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P83_S1	Under these OVRPs, we are provided with volume pricing on a customer-by-customer basis assuming certain minimum unit volumes are met.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P83_S2	The OVRP terms are 12 months.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P83_S3	In the event we don t meet the committed minimum unit volumes, we are obligated to pay the difference between the committed per-unit volume rate and the actual per-unit rate we achieved based upon actual units purchased.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P83_S4	The OVRP arrangements do not equate to a minimum purchase commitment but rather, the arrangements are a volume pricing arrangement based upon actual volume purchased.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P83_S5	In substantially all instances, we have reciprocal agreements with our customers such that we will receive per-unit price adjustments, similar to the amounts we would subsequently owe to Microsoft if such OVRP volumes are not met.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P83_S6	However, in the event a customer is unwilling or unable to pay us, we would be negatively impacted.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P83_S7	Based upon the credit-worthiness of our customers, our historical OVRP experience with our customers and OVRP arrangements in general, we do not believe we will incur any material liability in the current or future periods relating to existing agreements.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P84_S0	Equity Compensation Plans We have a stock plan (the Stock Plan ) and an inducement stock plan for newly hired employees (the Inducement Plan ) (collectively the Plans ).
1054721_15_ITEM8_P84_S1	Under the Plans, stock options may be granted with a fixed exercise price that is equivalent to fair market value on the date of grant.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P84_S2	These options have a term of up to 10 years and vest over a predetermined period, generally four years.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P84_S3	Incentive stock options granted under the Stock Plan may only be granted to our employees.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P84_S4	The Plans also allow for awards of non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSAs and unrestricted stock awards, and RSUs.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P84_S5	The estimated fair value of stock-based awards is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the award, net of estimated forfeitures.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P85_S0	We estimate forfeitures of stock based awards based on historical experience and expected future activity.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P86_S0	The fair value of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P86_S1	The fair value of stock option awards are estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of each vesting tranche as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton ( BSM ) option-pricing model.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P86_S2	The BSM model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and option life.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P86_S3	If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P87_S0	The fair values of our equity awards, primarily stock option grants, were estimated with the following weighted average assumptions:
1054721_15_ITEM8_P88_S0	The impact on our results of operations of recording stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):
1054721_15_ITEM8_P89_S0	The following table summarizes stock option activity under the Plans for 2014 and 2013:
1054721_15_ITEM8_P90_S0	At December 31, 2014, total compensation cost related to stock options granted to employees under the Plans but not yet recognized was $870,103, net of estimated forfeitures.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P90_S1	This cost will be amortized on the straight-line method over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.2 years.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P91_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the quoted price of our common stock for the number of options that were in-the-money at year end.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P92_S0	We issue new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P93_S0	The following table summarizes certain information about stock options for 2014 and 2013:
1054721_15_ITEM8_P94_S0	The following table summarizes restricted stock unit activity under the Stock Plan for 2014 and 2013:
1054721_15_ITEM8_P95_S0	At December 31, 2014, total compensation cost related to restricted stock units granted under the Stock Plan but not yet recognized was $304,729, net of estimated forfeitures.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P95_S1	This cost will be amortized on the straight-line method over a period of approximately 1.1 years.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P95_S2	Common Stock Reserved for Future Issuance The following table summarizes our shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under the Plans at December 31, 2014 and 2013:
1054721_15_ITEM8_P96_S0	We have a Profit Sharing and Deferred Compensation Plan, The Bsquare Corporation 401(k) Plan and Trust, (the Profit Sharing Plan ) under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P97_S0	Substantially all full-time employees are eligible to participate in the Profit Sharing Plan.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P97_S1	We typically elect to match the participants contributions to the Profit Sharing Plan up to a certain amount subject to vesting.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P97_S2	Participants will receive their share of the value of their investments, and any applicable vested match, upon retirement or termination.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P97_S3	We made matching contributions of $243,000 in 2014 and $335,000 in 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P97_S4	Of the annual matching contributions, $114,000 of the 2014 and zero of the 2013 contributions were composed of transfers from the Profit Sharing Plan s forfeiture account.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P98_S0	Significant Customer One customer, Future Electronics, Inc. accounted for 12% of total revenues in 2014.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P98_S1	No other customers accounted for 10% or more of total revenue in either 2014 or 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P98_S2	Future Electronics, Inc. had an accounts receivable balance of $3.7 million, or 23% of total accounts receivable, as of December 31, 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P98_S3	Mitsubishi Electric Corporation had an accounts receivable balance of $2.8 million, or 18% of total accounts receivable, as of December 31, 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P98_S4	Each of these balances was subsequently collected.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P98_S5	No other customer accounted for 10% or more of total accounts receivable at December 31, 2014 or 2013.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P99_S0	Significant Supplier We have two ODAs with Microsoft which enable us to sell Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems to our customers in the United States, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, the Caribbean (excluding Cuba), the European Union, the European Free Trade Association, Turkey and Africa, which expire on June 30, 2016.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P99_S1	We also have four ODAs with Microsoft which allow us to sell Microsoft Windows Mobile operating systems in the Americas (excluding Cuba), Japan, Taiwan, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, which expire on June 30, 2015.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P99_S2	Software sales under these agreements constitute a significant portion of our software revenue and total revenue.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P99_S3	These agreements are typically renewed annually or semi-annually; however, there is no automatic renewal provision in any of these agreements.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P99_S4	Further, these agreements can be terminated unilaterally by Microsoft at any time.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P100_S0	Microsoft currently offers a rebate program to sell Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems pursuant to which we earn money for achieving certain predefined objectives.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P100_S1	Prior to the third quarter of 2013, the earned rebate amount was treated as a reduction in software cost of sales in the quarter earned.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P100_S2	Beginning in the third quarter of 2013, as a result of program modifications, we began treating a portion of the rebate as marketing development funds which are accounted for as a reduction in marketing expense if and when qualified program expenditures are made.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P100_S3	Under this rebate program, we recognized $298,000 in 2014 and $774,000 in 2013, which was treated as a reduction in cost of sales.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P100_S4	Additionally, we qualified for $685,000 in 2014 and $409,000 in 2013, in rebate credits which will be accounted for as a reduction in marketing expense if and when qualified program expenditures are made.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P101_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2013, we effected a restructuring that included a workforce reduction and the closure of our offices in Beijing, China and Munich, Germany.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P101_S1	The workforce reduction impacted approximately 20% of our worldwide workforce.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P101_S2	The restructuring was intended to better align our organizational structure with our strategic focus.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P101_S3	The staff reductions and office closures were substantially completed by the end of the fourth quarter of 2013 with some activities, including legal entity closures, continuing through 2014.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P101_S4	We anticipate completion in early 2015.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P101_S5	The total amounts incurred in connection with the restructuring including asset impairments during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 by expense type are as follows (in thousands):
1054721_15_ITEM8_P102_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending liability balances by expense type follows (in thousands):
1054721_15_ITEM8_P103_S0	The restructuring costs have been included in the results of operations as follows (in thousands):
1054721_15_ITEM8_P104_S0	Our chief operating decision-makers (i.e., Chief Executive Officer, and certain of his direct reports) review financial information presented on a consolidated basis, accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues by geographic region for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P104_S1	There are no segment managers who are held accountable by our chief operating decision-makers, or anyone else, for operations, operating results, and planning for levels or components below the consolidated unit level.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P104_S2	Accordingly, we consider ourselves to be in a single reporting segment and operating unit structure.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P105_S0	Revenue by geography is based on the sales region of the customer.
1054721_15_ITEM8_P105_S1	The following table sets forth revenue and long-lived assets by geographic area (in thousands):
1054721_15_ITEM8_P106_S0	Following is a summary of unaudited quarterly financial information for 2014 and 2013:
1054721_15_ITEM9_P0_S0	Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure .
1054721_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1054721_15_ITEM9A_P0_S1	In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as of December 31, 2014, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.

1054721_15_ITEM9A_P0_S4	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

1054721_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	Building our offerings and capabilities in the rapidly growing Internet of Things market.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	Seeking additional software products, such as DataV, in which to invest.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	Relationship with Microsoft and Impact on our Smart Connected Solutions Business We have a long-standing relationship with Microsoft and this relationship is critical to the continuing success of our business.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P35_S1	Our credentials as a Microsoft partner include:
1054721_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	We have been engaged by Microsoft on various engineering service engagements.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P37_S0	We work closely with Microsoft executives, developers, product managers and sales personnel.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P37_S1	We leverage these relationships in a variety of ways, including:
1054721_16_ITEM1_P38_S0	We receive rebates from Microsoft based upon the achievement of predefined sales objectives.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for more information regarding our relationship with Microsoft.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	Customers Customers purchasing third-party software and our software solutions and engineering services include leading OEMs, ODMs, Enterprises, SVs and peripheral vendors seeking to leverage the software we provide them, be it our own proprietary software, third-party software or custom software developed via our engineering services, to develop high-quality, smart, connected systems that meet the requirements of numerous end-markets.

1054721_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	Sales and Marketing We market our software solutions and engineering services utilizing a direct sales model.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P41_S1	We have sales personnel throughout the United States and in Taiwan, the United Kingdom and Japan.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	Historically, we have not made significant use of resellers, channel partners, representative agents or other indirect channels.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P42_S1	Key elements of our sales and marketing strategy include direct marketing, content marketing, trade shows, event marketing, public relations, analyst relations, social media properties, customer and strategic alliance partner co-marketing programs and a comprehensive website.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P42_S2	We rely significantly on lead referral and other marketing support programs from strategic partners.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	Research and Development Our research and development personnel are responsible for the design, development and release of our proprietary software products.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P43_S1	Members of our research and development staff work closely with our sales and marketing departments, as well as with our customers and potential customers, to better understand market needs and requirements.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P43_S2	We perform our research and development primarily utilizing engineering staff located in the United States.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P43_S3	Research and development expense was $1.6 million and $1.7 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	Our primary focus in 2015 has been research and development on our new DataV products.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	Competition The market for smart, connected systems software and services is extremely competitive.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P45_S1	We face competition from the following:
1054721_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	Mobile and embedded test automation providers including Perfecto Mobile, mVerify, JAMO Solutions, SmartBear Software (AutomatedQA), TestPlant (eggPlant) and Keynote.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	The growing Internet of Things market will provide increasing competition from a number of additional software and service providers as we focus on this market in 2016 and beyond.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	Some of our competitors focus on only one aspect of our business or offer complementary products which can be integrated with our products.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P48_S1	As we develop and bring to market new software products and service offerings, we may begin competing with companies with which we have not previously competed.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P48_S2	Further, as we expand the geographic markets into which we sell our software solutions and related services, or increase our penetration therein, we may expect to increasingly compete with companies with which we have not previously competed.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P48_S3	It is also possible that new competitors will enter the market or that our competitors will form alliances, including alliances with Microsoft, that may enable them to rapidly increase their market share.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P48_S4	Microsoft has not agreed to any exclusive arrangement with us, nor has it agreed not to compete with us.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P48_S5	Microsoft may decide to bring more of the core embedded development services and expertise that we provide in-house, possibly resulting in reduced software and service revenue opportunities for us.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	The barrier to entering the market as a provider of Microsoft-based smart connected systems software and services is low.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P49_S1	In addition, Microsoft has created marketing programs to encourage systems integrators to work on Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating system software and services.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P49_S2	These systems integrators are given substantially the same access by Microsoft to the Microsoft technology as we are.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P49_S3	New competitors may have lower overhead than we do and may be able to undercut our pricing.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P49_S4	We expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter the connected device market, and as new products and technologies are introduced.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	Our international operations outside of North America consist principally of engineering services operations in Taipei, Taiwan and Trowbridge, England.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P50_S1	We have a sales and sales support office in Tokyo, Japan.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P50_S2	Because our OEM Distribution Agreement with Microsoft for the sale of Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems (e.g. Windows Embedded Compact) has been, until relatively recently, restricted to North America, including Mexico, the majority of our revenue continues to be generated from North America.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P50_S3	In 2015, revenue generated from customers located outside of North America was 8% of total revenue, compared to 10% in 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P50_S4	The decrease in revenue from outside of North America in 2015 was primarily attributable to lower service revenue in Asia as a result of the completion of a large handheld project in Japan during 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	See Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for more information regarding our international operations.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P51_S1	The following indicates our total headcount by area:
1054721_16_ITEM1_P52_S0	Of the total headcount of 201 at December 31, 2015, 113 were located in North America, 50 in Taiwan, 37 in the United Kingdom and one in Japan.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P53_S0	As conditions necessitate, engineering service employees perform research and development activities and vice versa.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P54_S0	In general, we strive to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and through contractual arrangements.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P54_S1	However, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be effective to prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, or to prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to, or competitive with, those developed by us.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P54_S2	Additionally, because a significant portion of our revenue relates to the sale of third-party software products, we also rely on our partners, particularly Microsoft, to appropriately protect their own intellectual property.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P54_S3	As of December 31, 2015 we had eight issued United States ( US ) patents and one pending US patent application that has been allowed and that we expect will issue in 2016.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P54_S4	We also have a number of registered trademarks in various jurisdictions.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P54_S5	We will continue to pursue appropriate protections for our intellectual property.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P54_S6	See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for more information regarding our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P55_S0	We electronically file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P55_S1	We make available on our website at www.bsquare.com, free of charge, copies of these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing such reports with, or furnishing them to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P55_S2	The information contained in, or that can be accessed through, our website is not part of, and is not incorporated into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1054721_16_ITEM1_P56_S0	The following table sets forth certain information with respect to our directors and executive officers as of January 31, 2016:
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	As discussed under Item 1 of Part I, Business Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, our actual results could differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and the trading price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Microsoft-Related Risk Factors Due to the fact that we provide software and services to customers building devices utilizing Microsoft s Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, as well as the fact that a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, Microsoft has a significant direct and indirect influence on our business.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P1_S3	The following Microsoft-related risk factors may negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P1_S4	If we do not maintain our OEM Distribution Agreements with Microsoft or if Microsoft de-emphasizes or divests itself from these areas of its business, our revenue would decrease and our business would be adversely affected.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We have OEM Distribution Agreements ( ODAs ) for Software Products for Embedded Systems with Microsoft, which enable us to sell various Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems to our customers in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean (excluding Cuba), Mexico, the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	These ODAs are effective through June 30, 2016.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P2_S2	We have also entered into other ODAs with Microsoft pursuant to which we are licensed to sell Microsoft Windows Mobile operating systems to customers in North America, South America, Central America (excluding Cuba), Japan, Taiwan, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P2_S3	The ODAs to sell Windows Mobile operating systems are effective through June 30, 2016.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P2_S4	We generated $80.4 million and $70.2 million of revenue in 2015 and 2014, respectively, through our sales of Microsoft operating systems and expect this revenue stream to continue in 2016.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P2_S5	If any of the ODAs are terminated by Microsoft (which Microsoft can do unilaterally) or not renewed, or if Microsoft decides to no longer invest in or to divest itself from these areas of its business, our software revenue and resulting gross profit could decrease significantly and our operating results would be negatively impacted.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Future renewals, if any, could be on less favorable terms, which could also negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P2_S7	Microsoft can change pricing under the ODAs at any time, and unless we are able to either pass through price increases to our customers or sign our customers to 12-month purchasing commitments, which lowers the price we pay to Microsoft, our revenue, gross profit and operating results would be negatively impacted.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P2_S8	Further, Microsoft currently offers a rebate program in conjunction with our ODA activities in which we earn money for achieving certain predefined objectives.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P2_S9	If Microsoft were to eliminate or negatively modify the rebate program, our gross profit and operating results would be negatively impacted.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P2_S10	We qualified for rebate credits from Microsoft of $1.1 million and $1.0 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, a portion of which is accounted for as a reduction in cost of sales and a portion as a reduction in marketing expense if and when qualified expenditures are made.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted by changes Microsoft i s implementing in its pricing of operating systems through its distributors.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Microsoft has implemented significant pricing changes for its embedded products, including ending its design registration pricing discounts, terminating its OEM Volume Royalty Program (OVRP) and changing the aggregate volume price structure and product royalties for existing embedded Windows products effective January 1, 2016.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	These changes to design registration pricing discounts will alter the competitive dynamics because the same pricing discounts will be available to all distributors of these Microsoft products.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P3_S3	As a distributor of Microsoft products, this will impact both the sales prices we charge our customers and the cost of goods sold we incur for many of the Microsoft products we sell.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P3_S4	At this time, the amount and impact of these changes to our revenue and gross profit are not determinable; however, they may negatively impact our operating results beginning in 2016.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P3_S5	However, during December 2015, we entered into transition OVRP agreements with Microsoft and a majority of our customers that extended the 2015 pricing for all of 2016.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P3_S6	The sale of Microsoft operating systems represented approximately 75% and 73% of our total revenue and approximately 56% and 52% of our total gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P3_S7	Microsoft has audited our records under the ODAs in the past and will likely audit our records again in the future and any negative audit results could result in additional charges and/or the termination of the ODAs.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	There are provisions in the ODAs that require us to maintain certain internal records and processes for auditing and other reasons.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Non-compliance with these and other requirements could result in the termination of the ODAs.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Microsoft has concluded audits of our records pertaining to the ODAs in 2009 and 2006, neither of which had material findings.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	It is possible that future audits could result in charges due to any material findings that are found.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The provisions also include terms that may make us contractually liable for payment of royalties to Microsoft in the event that certificates of authenticity are lost, damaged or stolen.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	If we are invoiced by Microsoft for a pricing adjustments under OVRP arrangements and we are unable to pass through the charge to our customers, our operating results and cash flow would be negatively impacted.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	In conjunction with our activities under the ODAs with Microsoft, we enter into OVRP commitments with Microsoft.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Under these OVRPs, we are provided with volume pricing on a customer-by-customer basis assuming certain minimum unit volumes are met.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	The OVRP terms are 12 months.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P7_S3	In the event we do not meet the committed minimum unit volumes, we are obligated to pay the difference between the committed per-unit volume rate and the actual per-unit rate we achieved based upon actual units purchased.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P7_S4	The OVRP arrangements do not equate to a minimum purchase commitment but rather the arrangements are a volume pricing arrangement based upon actual volume purchased.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P7_S5	In substantially all instances, we have reciprocal agreements with our customers such that we will receive per-unit price adjustments, similar to the amounts we would subsequently owe to Microsoft if such OVRP volumes are not met.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P7_S6	While our history with OVRP arrangements has shown that very few result in a price adjustment and, for those that have, we have been able to pass through the price adjustment to our customer, in the event the customer is unwilling or unable to pay us, our operating results and cash flow would be negatively impacted.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P7_S7	If we do not maintain our favorable relationship with Microsoft, we will have difficulty marketing and selling our software and services and may not receive developer releases of Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P7_S8	As a result, our revenue and operating results could suffer.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P7_S9	We maintain a strategic marketing relationship with Microsoft.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P7_S10	If our relationship with Microsoft deteriorates for any reason, such as an increased focus by us on customers building devices utilizing non-Microsoft operating systems, our efforts to market and sell our software and services to our customers could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Microsoft has significant influence over the development plans and buying decisions of customers utilizing the various Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Microsoft provides customer referrals to us.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Moreover, Microsoft controls the marketing campaigns related to its operating systems.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Microsoft s marketing activities are important to the continued promotion and market acceptance of Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems and, consequently, to our sale of Windows-based software and services.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P8_S4	We must maintain a favorable relationship with Microsoft to continue to participate in joint marketing activities with them, which includes participating in partner pavilions at trade shows, listing our services on Microsoft s website, and receiving customer referrals.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P8_S5	If we are unable to continue our joint marketing efforts with Microsoft, or fail to receive referrals from them, we would be required to devote significant additional resources and incur additional expenses to market our software products and services directly to potential customers.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P8_S6	In addition, we depend on Microsoft for developer releases of new versions of, and upgrades to, its Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile software in order to facilitate timely development and delivery of our own software and services.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P8_S7	If we are unable to maintain our favorable relationship with Microsoft and no longer continue receiving such new versions and updates, our revenue could decline significantly, and/or our costs could increase significantly, thereby negatively impacting our operating results.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Unexpected delays or announcement of delays by Microsoft related to product releases of Windows Embedded or Windows Mobile operating systems could adversely affect our revenue and operating results.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Unexpected delays or announcement of delays in Microsoft s delivery schedule for new versions of Windows Embedded or Windows Mobile operating systems could cause us to delay our product introductions or impede our ability to sell our products and services and/or to complete customer projects on a timely basis.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Such delays or announcements of delays by Microsoft could also cause our customers to delay or cancel their project development activities or product introductions, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P9_S3	If Microsoft adds features to its Windows operating systems or develops products that directly compete with products and services we provide, our revenue and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P9_S4	As the developer of Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, Microsoft could add features which eliminate or reduce our customers need for our software and services, or Microsoft could develop standalone products and services that compete with the products and services we provide to our customers.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P9_S5	The ability of our customers, or potential customers, to obtain products and services directly from Microsoft that compete with our products and services could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P9_S6	Even if the standard features of future Microsoft operating system software were more limited than our offerings, a significant number of our customers, and potential customers, might elect to accept more limited functionality in lieu of purchasing additional software from us or delay the purchase of our products and services while they perform a comparison of Microsoft s competing offerings.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P9_S7	Moreover, the resulting competitive pressures could lead to price reductions for our offerings and reduce our revenue and gross profit accordingly and our operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P9_S8	Our business and results of operations would be adversely impacted if Microsoft decided to provide some, or all, of its Windows Embedded or Windows Mobile operating systems which we currently resell, free of charge to customers.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Microsoft has recently announced programs to offer certain consumer Windows phone and tablet-based operating systems to customers free of charge, subject to certain limitations.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	While we do not distribute these operating systems today under our ODAs with Microsoft, if Microsoft were to pursue a similar strategy and offer operating systems that we do currently distribute free of charge, our business and results of operations would be adversely impacted.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Microsoft recently introduced its Windows 10 operating system software, and Microsoft s pricing and support for this new operating system could directly impact our revenue and margins.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	In 2015 Microsoft introduced a new operating system, Windows 10.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In the future, Windows 10 could be delivered as a service, which could alter the traditional business model used to sell Microsoft licenses as a software product.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P11_S2	As a reseller of Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, changes to Microsoft s business model may adversely impact our revenue and gross profit and our operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P11_S3	If the markets for Windows Embedded and/or Windows Mobile operating systems decline, our business and operating results may be materially harmed.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Because a significant portion of our revenue to date has been generated by software and services targeted at customers and devices utilizing the various Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, if the markets for these systems or platforms decline, our business and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Market acceptance of Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems will depend on many factors, including:
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Microsoft s development and support of various Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile markets.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	In Motion Limited ( RIM and other proprietary operating systems.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The willingness of software developers to continue to develop and expand the applications running on Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	To the extent that software developers write applications for competing operating systems that are more attractive to users than those available on Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, this could cause potential customers to select competing operating systems.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	MyFord Touch-Related Risk Factors As our role on the MyFord Touch program diminishes, our future revenue and gross profit with respect to this program will decrease and our operating results will be adversely affected.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We began working on the MyFord Touch infotainment project with Ford in the second quarter of 2008 and continue to work on the program.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Since inception of the program through December 31, 2011, our contractual relationship was with Ford.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Effective January 1, 2012, our contractual relationship for the MyFord Touch program shifted from Ford to Microsoft, as Microsoft became the primary vendor to Ford for this program, and, as of 2014, to Elektrobit Automotive.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P15_S4	In December 2014, Ford introduced Sync 3, the next generation MyFord Touch program that is scheduled to be deployed on cars in 2016 which is based on QNX software from Blackberry instead of software from Microsoft, and thus our role on the program has been scaled back.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Revenue from the MyFord Touch program comprised $2.9 million, or 3% of our total revenue in 2015, and $2.8 million, or 3%, of our total revenue in 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P15_S6	We currently expect this project work to continue in 2016 but expect revenue from the MyFord Touch program to be significantly reduced in 2016 due to the lower level of personnel resources utilized on the program because of the transition to QNX software for the next generation Sync 3.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P15_S7	Specifically, we have been informed by Elektrobit that they will require significantly fewer personnel resources from us in 2016 as Ford has decided to limit development efforts on the current generation of the Sync 2 platform, which will adversely impact our revenue and utilization rates beginning in the first half of 2016.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	New Product-Related Risk Factors Our ability to maintain or grow our proprietary software revenue is contingent on our ability to bring to market DataV, our new proprietary actionable data solution for the Internet of Things (IoT) market.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We will require competitive, unique offerings that keep pace with technological changes and needs.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P16_S2	DataV may not gain traction with potential customers and if we are not successful in doing so, our business would be negatively impacted.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Proprietary software product revenue provides us with much higher gross profit margins than we typically receive from both our third-party software products and our engineering service offerings, and provides other advantages as well.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Increasing the number and amount of proprietary products we sell is an important part of our growth strategy.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P17_S2	During 2014 and 2015 we have invested significant resources in developing our DataV proprietary software product, which is an actionable data solution for the Internet of Things (IoT) market.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P17_S3	As a new product, DataV may gain customer traction in 2016 more slowly than anticipated and our profit potential from this new product is uncertain.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P17_S4	We expect to continue to make investments in the development of DataV, and this will increase our operating expenses.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P17_S5	We cannot assure you that there will be sufficient, or any, corresponding increases in revenue generated by sales of DataV, or if it will achieve customer adoption quickly, or at all.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P17_S6	Our failure to do so could negatively impact revenue and our operating results.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P17_S7	If the market for smart, connected systems evolves based on technologies that we do not support, our revenue may not grow as anticipated, if at all, and our business would be harmed.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The technologies used in smart, connected systems change very rapidly and it is often difficult to foresee and predict which application processors, operating systems, connectivity, testing and application development technologies will gain a foothold in device development.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	As a smaller company we can invest our resources in a limited number of technologies and as such must make forward investments in developing products and capabilities to support the technologies that we choose.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P18_S2	If we make investments in technologies that do not gain traction in device development, our profit potential is uncertain and our revenue may not develop as anticipated.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P18_S3	We are dependent upon the broad acceptance and adoption by businesses and consumers of a wide variety of device technologies, which will depend on many factors, including:
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The amount of discretionary funds companies and individuals have to spend for the latest technologies.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We may experience delays in our efforts to develop new products and services, and these delays could cause us to miss market opportunities which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The market for our software and services evolves rapidly.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	As a result, the life cycles of our products and services are difficult to estimate.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P21_S2	To be successful, we believe we must continue to enhance our current offerings and provide new software and service offerings with attractive features, prices and terms that appeal to our customers.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P21_S3	We have experienced delays in new software and service offering introductions in the past and may do so again in the future.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Our revenue and operating results may be negatively impacted if we delay releases of new products, product enhancements and/or new services offerings, or if we fail to accurately anticipate our customers needs or technical trends and are unable to introduce new products and service offerings into the market successfully.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P21_S5	In addition, our customers may defer or forego purchases of our products and/or services if we, Microsoft, our competitors or major hardware, systems or software vendors introduce or announce new products.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The long sales cycle of our products and services makes our revenue susceptible to fluctuations.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Our sales cycle can run three to twelve months because the expense and complexity of the software and service offerings we sell generally require a lengthy customer approval process and may be subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control, including:
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The timing of customers competitive evaluation processes.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	In addition, to successfully sell our software and engineering service offerings, we must frequently educate our potential customers about the full benefits of our software and services, which can require significant time.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	If our sales cycle further lengthens unexpectedly, it could adversely affect the timing of our revenue, which could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	General Business-Related Risk Factors Our marketplace is extremely competitive, which may result in price reductions, lower gross profit margins and loss of market share.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The market for device software and services is extremely competitive.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We face competition from the following:
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Mobile and embedded test automation providers including Perfecto Mobile, mVerify, JAMO Solutions, SmartBear Software (AutomatedQA), TestPlant (eggPlant) and Keynote.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating system distributors such as Arrow Electronics, Inc.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We will encounter increasing competition in the growing Internet of Things market from a number of additional software and service providers as we expand our focus on this market in 2016 and beyond.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Some of our competitors focus on only one aspect of our business or offer complementary products which can be integrated with our products.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	As we develop and bring to market new software products and service offerings, we may begin competing with companies with which we have not previously competed.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Further, as we expand the geographic markets into which we sell our software solutions and related services, or increase our penetration therein, we may expect to increasingly compete with companies with which we have not previously competed.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P30_S3	It is also possible that new competitors will enter the market or that our competitors will form alliances, including alliances with Microsoft, that may enable them to rapidly increase their market share.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Microsoft has not agreed to any exclusive arrangement with us, nor has it agreed not to compete with us.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	the core embedded development services and expertise that we provide in-house, possibly resulting in reduced software and ser vice revenue opportunities for us.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The barrier to entering the market as a provider of Microsoft-based smart connected system software and services is low.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P32_S1	In addition, Microsoft has created marketing programs to encourage systems integrators to work on Wi ndows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating system software and services.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P32_S2	These systems integrators are given substantially the same access by Microsoft to the Microsoft technology as we are.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P32_S3	New competitors may have lower overhead than we do and may be ab le to undercut our pricing.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P32_S4	We expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter the connected device market, and as new products and technologies are introduced.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P32_S5	Management turnover creates uncertainties and could harm our business.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P32_S6	We have had significant changes in executive leadership in the past and more could occur.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P32_S7	Changes to strategic or operating goals, which can often occur with the appointment of new executives, can create uncertainty, may negatively impact our ability to execute quickly and effectively, and may ultimately be unsuccessful.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P32_S8	In addition, executive leadership transition periods are often difficult as the new executives gain detailed knowledge of our operations, and friction can result from changes in strategy and management style.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Management turnover inherently causes some loss of institutional knowledge, which can negatively affect strategy and execution.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Until we integrate new personnel, and unless they are able to succeed in their positions, we may be unable to successfully manage and grow our business, and our financial condition and profitability may suffer.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Further, to the extent we experience additional management turnover, competition for top management is high and it may take months to find a candidate that meets our requirements.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P33_S3	If we are unable to attract and retain qualified management personnel, our business could suffer.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Our future success depends upon our customers ability to successfully sell their products incorporating our technology and to continue buying our services.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P33_S5	Even if a customer selects us to provide software and services, the customer may not ultimately market and sell its product successfully.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P33_S6	A cancellation or change in plans by a customer, whether from lack of market acceptance of its products or otherwise, could cause us to lose revenue that we had anticipated and our revenue and operating results would suffer.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P33_S7	Also, our revenue and operating results could suffer if a significant customer reduces or delays orders during our sales cycle or chooses not to release products that contain our technology.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P33_S8	The success and profitability of our service offerings are contingent on our ability to differentiate these offerings adequately in the marketplace, which is, in turn, contingent on our ability to retain our engineering personnel and defend our billing rate structure against those of our competitors, including those using significant lower-cost offshore resources.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P33_S9	If we are unable to do so successfully, our business could be harmed.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P33_S10	We are a leader in providing engineering services to customers developing smart devices.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P33_S11	Our market differentiation is created through several factors, including our experience with a variety of smart connected system platforms and applications.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P33_S12	Our differentiation is contingent, in part, on our ability to attract and retain employees with this expertise, a significant portion of which are currently based in the United States.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P33_S13	To the extent we are unable to retain critical engineering services talent and/or our competition is able to deliver the same services by using significant lower-cost offshore resources, our service revenue and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P33_S14	The success and profitability of our service engagements are contingent upon our ability to scope and bid engagements and deliver our services profitably.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P33_S15	If we are unable to do so, our service revenue service gross profit margin and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Various factors may cause the total cost of service projects to exceed the original estimate provided to the customer or the contractual maximum in the case of fixed price contracts, including specification changes, customer deliverable delays, inadequate scoping and inefficient service delivery.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P34_S1	If we are unable to adequately scope, bid and deliver on service engagements successfully, our service revenue, service gross margin and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P34_S2	In addition, depending on the cause of an overrun for a given customer and project, we may also decide to provide pricing concessions to that customer which could negatively impact our service revenue, service gross profit and operating results.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We periodically enter into engineering service agreements in which we agree to perform our engineering service work for lower up-front fees, or for no fees, in exchange for future royalties or per unit fees.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P35_S1	There is no guarantee that these arrangements will produce the strategic or economic returns as anticipated.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We have entered into contracts that involve reducing or eliminating up-front engineering service fees in return for a per-device/chip royalty or fee that is earned as devices or chips are shipped by our customers, and we may enter into more such agreements in the future.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Because we are delaying revenue past the point where our services are performed, there is a risk that our customers may cancel their projects or that their devices or chips may not be successful in the market, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Cooperation and support from silicon vendors is critical for the success of our products and related services that are developed for their particular silicon architecture.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P36_S3	We have developed, and continue to develop, software and service offerings based on certain silicon architectures.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Due to the nature of the industry we serve and the products we develop, it is necessary for us to make certain assumptions regarding which silicon vendors will be successful in the various markets we serve and upon which we are making investments.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P36_S5	It is therefore important that there is ongoing support from the SVs in the marketplace for these silicon architectures.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P36_S6	There can be no assurance that TI, Qualcomm, Freescale, Intel or any of the other SVs will continue to pursue and support the markets that we have been targeting.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P36_S7	If the SVs do not support our efforts going forward, our revenue and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P36_S8	Our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P36_S9	Challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time-to-time contributed, and may continue to contribute, to slowdowns in the technology industries at large, as well as in specific segments and markets in which we operate, resulting in: reduced demand for our products as a result of continued constraints on IT-related capital spending by our customers; purchasing delays; payment delays adversely affecting our cash flow and revenue; and difficulty in accurate budgeting and planning.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P36_S10	If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in key markets, remain uncertain or deteriorate further, we may experience material impacts on our business, operating results and financial condition.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P36_S11	Erosion of the financial condition of our customers could adversely affect our business.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P36_S12	Our business could be adversely affected if the financial condition of our customers erodes because such erosion could reduce demand from those customers for our software and engineering services.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P36_S13	This could also cause them to terminate their relationships with us, and/or could increase the risk that such customers default on their payment obligations to us.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P36_S14	Additionally, while we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate, economic trends may cause more companies to default or cease operations, in which case our allowances may not cover actual losses, which could adversely affect our operating results.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P36_S15	Our business and operations would be adversely impacted in the event of a failure or interruption of our information technology infrastructure.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P36_S16	The proper functioning of our information technology infrastructure is critical to the efficient operation and management of our business.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P36_S17	Our technology infrastructure is vulnerable to cyber-attacks, computer viruses, worms and other malicious software programs, physical and electronic break-ins, sabotage and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P36_S18	We believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology infrastructure and our operations from these information technology-related and other potential disruptions.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P36_S19	However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P36_S20	We may be subject to product liability claims that could result in significant costs.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P36_S21	Our software license and service agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P36_S22	It is possible, however, that these provisions may be ineffective under the laws of certain jurisdictions or that our customers may not agree to these limitations.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P36_S23	Although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date, the sale and support of our products and services may be subject to such claims in the future.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	A product liability claim brought against us, whether successful or not, could negatively impact our business and operating results .
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Our business and results of operations would be adversely impacted in the event that we incur business losses that are not covered by or exceed our existing business insurance coverage.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P37_S2	We are insured against certain business risks and liabilities under our corporate insurance policies.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P37_S3	However to the extent that we incur losses in connection with our business that are not covered by our existing insurance policies or that exceed our existing policy coverage, our business and results of operations would be adversely impacted.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P37_S4	Negative business conditions, changes in useful lives, and other factors may negatively affect the carrying value of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P37_S5	In the third quarter of 2011, we acquired MPC Data, Ltd. including certain intangible assets with a carrying value of $561,000 and goodwill of $3.7 million as of December 31, 2015.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P37_S6	Although we expect to generate cash from the intangible assets in the future, and do not foresee any impairment of our goodwill, it is possible that we may be required to reassess the carrying value of these assets in the future if certain negative business conditions occur such as negative results of our business associated with our intangible assets or a low stock price.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P37_S7	Any reduction in the carrying value of these intangible assets or goodwill would result in an impairment charge that would negatively impact our operating results.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P37_S8	Further, business conditions and other factors may also require us to reassess the useful lives associated with intangible assets.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P37_S9	Past acquisitions have proven difficult to integrate, and recent or future acquisitions, if any, could disrupt our business, dilute shareholder value and negatively affect our operating results.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We have acquired the technologies, assets and/or operations of other companies in the past and may acquire or make investments in companies, products, services and technologies in the future as part of our growth strategy.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P38_S1	If we fail to properly evaluate, integrate and execute on our acquisitions and investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P38_S2	To successfully complete an acquisition, we must properly evaluate the technology, market and management team, accurately forecast the financial impact of the transaction, including accounting charges and transaction expenses, integrate and retain personnel, combine potentially different corporate cultures and effectively integrate products and research and development, sales, marketing and support operations.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P38_S3	If we fail to do any of these, we may suffer losses and impair relationships with our employees, customers and strategic partners.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Additionally, management may be distracted from day-to-day operations.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P38_S5	We also may be unable to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, which are especially critical in light of requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other corporate governance requirements, and significant demands may be placed on our management and our operations, information services and financial, legal and marketing resources.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P38_S6	Finally, acquired businesses sometimes result in unexpected liabilities and contingencies, which may involve compliance with foreign laws, payment of taxes, labor negotiations or other unknown costs and expenses, which could be significant.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We may not be able to raise additional capital if required to support our business.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P39_S1	If we need to raise additional operating capital, we may find that our access to equity and debt capital markets is limited or blocked entirely.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P39_S2	In the past, our stock has traded at low volumes and overall investor confidence in the stock market could falter.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P39_S3	This could make it difficult or impossible to sell additional shares on the public markets.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P39_S4	In addition, it may be difficult and costly to obtain debt financing and we may be unable to borrow additional funds at acceptable cost, or at all, should the need arise.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P39_S5	If we are unable to raise capital as necessary, it may adversely affect our ability to invest in products or fund operations, which would materially harm our business and negatively affect operating results.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P39_S6	Our common stock has experienced and may continue to experience price and volume fluctuations, which could lead to costly litigation for us and make an investment in us less appealing.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Stock markets are subject to significant price and volume fluctuations which may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies and the market price of our common stock may therefore frequently change as a result.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P40_S1	In addition, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate substantially due to a variety of other factors, including quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations, announcements about technological innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors, market acceptance of new products and services offered by us, changes in our relationships with our suppliers or customers, our ability to meet analysts expectations, changes in the information technology environment, changes in earnings estimates by analysts, sales of our common stock by existing holders and the loss of key personnel.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management s attention and resources which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Taxing jurisdictions in the United States are becoming more aggressive with tax legislation and tax collection, particularly states facing significant budget deficits, which could expose us to additional tax liability that we have not been subject to in the past.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P42_S1	We make sales in many jurisdictions across the United States, most of which we do not have nexus in and, therefore, are not subject to sales, franchise, income and other state and local taxes.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Particularly in light of state revenue deficits, taxing jurisdictions have become more aggressive in defining nexus, among other things, which could result in us achieving nexus, or potentially achieving nexus in significantly more tax jurisdictions.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P42_S3	If this occurs and unless we are able to pass through this cost to our customers, our tax expense will increase which will negatively affect our results of operations.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Further, because state and local tax laws are becoming increasingly complex, our cost to monitor our state and local tax compliance will increase which will negatively affect our results of operations.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P42_S5	Additionally, there can be no assurance that we do not currently have unknown tax exposure in a state or local tax jurisdiction because of recent tax law changes which we are unaware of and the resulting liability could be significant and would negatively affect our results of operations.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	There may be restrictions on the use of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards due to a tax law ownership change.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code restricts the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P44_S1	At December 31, 2015, we had approximately $54.4 million of federal and $1.6 million of state net operating loss carryforwards and $2.7 million of tax credit carryforwards.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Of the federal net operating loss carryforwards, an aggregate of $36.4 million will expire in 2022 and 2023.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Under the applicable tax rules, an ownership change occurs if greater than five percent shareholders of an issuer s outstanding common stock collectively increase their ownership percentage by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P45_S1	We have performed analyses of possible ownership changes which included consideration of a third-party study, and do not believe that an ownership change as defined by Section 382 has occurred.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P45_S2	However, if a tax law ownership change has occurred of which we are not aware, or if a tax law ownership change occurs in the future, we may have to adjust the valuation of our deferred tax assets, and could be at risk of having to pay income taxes notwithstanding the existence of our sizable carryforwards.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Further, to the extent that we have utilized our carryforwards from prior years, the existence of a previous tax law ownership change that we did not account for could result in liability for back taxes, interest, and penalties.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P45_S4	If we are unable to utilize our carryforwards and/or if we previously utilized carryforwards to which we were not entitled, it would negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P45_S5	Intellectual Property-Related Risk Factors Our software and service offerings could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which could expose us to additional costs and litigation and could adversely affect our ability to sell our products and services or cause shipment delays or stoppages.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P45_S6	It is difficult to determine whether our software and engineering services infringe third-party intellectual property rights, particularly in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which technologies often overlap and where there may be numerous patent applications pending, many of which are confidential when filed.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P45_S7	If we were to discover that one of our software or service offerings, or a product based on one of our reference designs, violated a third-party s proprietary rights, we may not be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, to continue offering that product or service.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P45_S8	Similarly, third parties may claim that our current or future software products and services infringe their proprietary rights, regardless of whether such claims have merit.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P45_S9	Any such claims could increase our costs and negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	In certain cases, we have been unable to obtain indemnification against claims that third-party technology incorporated into our software products and services infringe the proprietary rights of others.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P46_S1	However, any indemnification we do obtain may be limited in scope or amount.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Even if we receive broad third-party indemnification, these entities may not have the financial capability to indemnify us in the event of infringement.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P46_S3	In addition, in some circumstances we are required to indemnify our customers for claims made against them that are based on our software products or services.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P46_S4	There can be no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims related to the software products and services we provide, or arising from the incorporation by us of third-party technology, and claims for indemnification from our customers resulting from such claims, will not be asserted or prosecuted against us.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P46_S5	Some of our competitors have, or are affiliated, with companies with substantially greater resources than we have, and these competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than we could.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P46_S6	In addition, we expect that software developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the software industry grows, and as the functionality of products in different industry segments increasingly overlap.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P46_S7	Such claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources in addition to potential product redevelopment costs and delays.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	technologies and products, or delivering services based on the infri nging technology, unless we obtain a license from the holder of the patent or other intellectual property rights.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P47_S1	There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain any such license on commercially favorable terms, or at all.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P47_S2	If such license is not obtained, we would be required to cease these related business operations, which could negatively impact our business, revenue and operating results.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P47_S3	If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may be able to use our technology or trademarks, which could weaken our competitive position, reduce our revenue and increase our costs.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P47_S4	If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, our competitive position could be weakened and our revenue and operating results adversely affected.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P47_S5	We rely primarily on confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions as well as a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, to protect our intellectual property.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P47_S6	These laws and procedures provide only limited protection.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P47_S7	It is possible that another party could obtain patents that block our use of some, or all, of our software and services.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P47_S8	If that occurred, we would need to obtain a license from the patent holder or design around those patents.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P47_S9	The patent holder may or may not choose to make a license available to us at all, or on acceptable terms.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P47_S10	Similarly, it may not be possible to design around a blocking patent.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P47_S11	In general, there can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws will be effective to prevent misappropriation of our technology, or to prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to or competitive with those developed by us.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We frequently license the source code of our software products and the source code results of our services to customers.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P48_S1	There can be no assurance that customers with access to our source code will comply with the license terms or that we will discover any violations of the license terms or, in the event of discovery of violations, that we will be able to successfully enforce the license terms and/or recover the economic value lost from such violations.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	To license some of our software products, we rely in part on shrink-wrap and click wrap licenses that are not signed by the end user and, therefore, may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P49_S1	As with other software, our software products are susceptible to unauthorized copying and uses that may go undetected, and policing such unauthorized use is difficult.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P50_S0	A significant portion of our marks include the word BSQUARE.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Other companies use forms of BSQUARE in their marks alone, or in combination with other words, and we cannot prevent all such third-party uses.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We license certain trademark rights to third parties.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Such licensees may not abide by our compliance and quality control guidelines with respect to such trademark rights.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Any of these outcomes could negatively impact our brand, dilute its recognition in the marketplace, or confuse potential customers, all of which could harm our business.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P52_S0	The computer software market is characterized by frequent and substantial intellectual property litigation, which is often complex and expensive, and involves a significant diversion of resources and uncertainty of outcome.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property or to defend against a claim of infringement or invalidity.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Litigation could result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources and could negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P52_S3	Our software or hardware products or the third-party hardware or software integrated with our products or delivered as part of our service offerings may suffer from defects or errors that could impair our ability to sell our products and services.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P52_S4	Software and hardware components as complex as those needed for smart connected systems frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P52_S5	We have had to delay commercial release of certain versions of our products until problems were corrected and, in some cases, have provided product enhancements to correct errors in released products.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P52_S6	Some of our contracts require us to repair or replace products that fail to work.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P52_S7	To the extent that we repair or replace products our expenses may increase.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P52_S8	In addition, it is possible that by the time defects are fixed, the market opportunity may decline which may result in lost revenue.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P52_S9	Moreover, to the extent that we provide increasingly comprehensive products and services, particularly those focused on hardware, and rely on third-party manufacturers and suppliers to manufacture these products, we will be dependent on the ability of third-party manufacturers to correct, identify and prevent manufacturing errors.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P52_S10	Errors that are discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance, diversion of development resources, damage to our reputation and increased service and warranty costs, all of which could negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P52_S11	If we are unable to license key software from third parties, our business could be harmed.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P52_S12	We sometimes integrate third-party software with our proprietary software and engineering service offerings or sell such third-party software offerings on a standalone basis (e.g. Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems under our ODAs with Microsoft).
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P52_S13	If our relationships with these third-party software vendors were to deteriorate, or be eliminated in their entirety, we might be unable to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P53_S0	which could delay or limit our ability to introduce enhancements or new products, or to continue to sell existing products and engineering services, thereby negatively impacting our revenue and operating results.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Governance-Related Risk Factors It might be difficult for a third-party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation, bylaws and Washington law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in the control of us or a change in our management, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Our Board of Directors has the authority under our amended and restated articles of incorporation to issue preferred stock with rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P54_S3	As a result, preferred stock could be issued quickly and easily with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make removal of our management more difficult.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P54_S4	In addition, our Board of Directors is divided into three classes.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P54_S5	The directors in each class serve for three-year terms, one class being elected each year by our shareholders.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P54_S6	This system of electing and removing directors may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company because it generally makes it more difficult for shareholders to replace a majority of our directors.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P54_S7	In addition, Chapter 19 of the Washington Business Corporation Act generally prohibits a target corporation from engaging in certain significant business transactions with a defined acquiring person for a period of five years after the acquisition, unless the transaction or acquisition of shares is approved by a majority of the members of the target corporation s Board of Directors prior to the time of acquisition.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P54_S8	This provision may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of our company.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P54_S9	The existence of these anti-takeover provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P55_S0	International Operations-Related Risk Factors Our international operations expose us to greater intellectual property, management, collections, regulatory and other risks.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Customers outside of North America generated 8% of our total revenue in 2015 and 10% in 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P55_S2	We currently have sizable operations outside of North America in Taiwan and the United Kingdom and also have a small sales and support presence in Japan.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P55_S3	Our international activities and operations expose us to a number of risks, including the following:
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Complex and/or adverse tax laws and/or changes thereto.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P57_S0	The inherent risks of working in a certain highly regulated and/or controlled economies where relationships between company management and government officials is critical to timely processing of approvals required to conduct business.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P58_S0	These risks could have a material adverse effect on the financial and managerial resources required to operate our foreign offices, as well as on our future international revenue, which could negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P59_S0	As our customers seek more cost-effective locations to develop and manufacture their products, particularly overseas locations, our ability to continue to sell these customers our software products and services could be limited, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Due to competitive and other pressures, some of our customers have moved, and others may seek to move, the development and manufacturing of their smart, connected systems to overseas locations, which may limit our ability to sell these customers our software and services.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P59_S2	As an example, under our ODAs with Microsoft, we are currently only able to sell Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems to our customers in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean (excluding Cuba), Mexico, the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
1054721_16_ITEM1A_P59_S3	If our customers, or potential customers, move their manufacturing overseas we may be less competitive, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	As of December 31, 2015, our corporate headquarters are located in 24,061 square feet of leased space in a single location in Bellevue, Washington.
1054721_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	The lease term ends in May 2020.
1054721_16_ITEM2_P0_S2	In North America, we also lease office space in San Diego, California; Boston, Massachusetts; and Akron, Ohio.
1054721_16_ITEM2_P0_S3	We lease office space overseas in Tokyo, Japan; Taipei, Taiwan; and Trowbridge, United Kingdom.
1054721_16_ITEM2_P0_S4	Our facilities have sufficient capacity to support our current operational needs as well as short-term growth plans.

1054721_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol BSQR.
1054721_16_ITEM5_P1_S1	The following table sets forth the high and low closing prices for our common stock for the periods indicated, as reported by the NASDAQ Global Market.
1054721_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	Holders As of January 31, 2016, there were 120 holders of record of our common stock.
1054721_16_ITEM5_P2_S1	Because many shares of our common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of shareholders, we are unable to determine the total number of shareholders represented by these holders of record.
1054721_16_ITEM5_P2_S2	Dividends We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock.
1054721_16_ITEM5_P2_S3	We currently intend to retain any future earnings to fund future development and growth and, therefore, do not anticipate paying any consistent cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1054721_16_ITEM5_P3_S0	Our line of credit agreement contains limitations on our ability to pay distributions or dividends while there is an ongoing event of default or to the extent such distribution causes an event of default.
1054721_16_ITEM5_P3_S1	Our Board of Directors has, however, periodically considered implementing a share repurchase program and/or a special one-time cash dividend.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations may contain some statements and information which are not historical facts but are forward-looking statements.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P1_S2	Business Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, and Item 1A of Part I, Risk Factors.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	We provide software solutions and related engineering services to companies that develop smart, connected systems.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	A smart, connected system is a dedicated purpose computing device that typically has a display, runs an operating system (e.g., Microsoft Windows Embedded Compact) and is usually connected to a network or data cloud via a wired or wireless connection.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	Examples of smart, connected systems include set-top boxes, home gateways, point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, voting machines, gaming platforms, tablets, handheld data collection devices, personal media players, smart phones, smart vending machines, in-vehicle telematics and entertainment devices.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P3_S2	We primarily focus on smart, connected systems that utilize Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems as well as devices running other popular operating systems such as Android, Linux and QNX.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P3_S3	We have been providing software solutions for smart, connected systems since our inception.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P3_S4	Our customers include world class OEMs, ODMs and Enterprises, as well as SVs and peripheral vendors which purchase our software solutions for purposes of facilitating processor and peripheral sales.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P3_S5	In the case of Enterprises, our customers include those which develop, market and distribute smart, connected systems on their own behalf as well as those that purchase systems from OEMs or ODMs and require additional software, integration and/or testing.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P3_S6	The software solutions we provide are utilized and deployed throughout various phases of our customers device life cycle, including design, development, customization, quality assurance and deployment.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P3_S7	Building on the traditional focus of our business noted above, increasingly we intend to focus on developing and offering our own products such as DataV to address the emerging IoT market.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	DataV is an actionable data solution for the IoT market that includes software products, applications and services that turn raw device data into useful, meaningful and actionable data.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	Critical Accounting Judgments Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from software and engineering service sales when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the selling price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	Contracts and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P5_S2	Shipping documents and time records are generally used to verify delivery.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P5_S3	We assess whether the selling price is fixed or determinable based on the contract and/or customer purchase order and payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P5_S4	We assess collectability based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer s payment history.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P5_S5	Periodically, we will begin work on engineering service engagements prior to having a signed contract and, in some cases, the contract is signed in a quarter after which service delivery costs are incurred.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P5_S6	We do not defer costs associated with such engagements before we have received a signed contract.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P5_S7	We recognize software revenue upon shipment provided that no significant obligations remain on our part, substantive acceptance conditions, if any, have been met and the other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	Service revenue from time and materials contracts, and training service agreements, is recognized as services are performed.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	Fixed-price service agreements, and certain time and materials service agreements with capped fee structures, are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method assuming reasonable estimates of completion can be made.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P6_S2	We use the percentage-of-completion method of accounting because we believe it is the most accurate method to recognize revenue based on the nature and scope of these engineering service contracts; we believe it is a better measure of periodic income results than other methods and better matches revenue recognized with the costs incurred.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P6_S3	Percentage of completion is measured based primarily on input measures such as hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P6_S4	Significant judgment is required when estimating total hours and progress to completion on these arrangements which determines the amount of revenue we recognize as well as whether a loss is recognized if one is expected to be incurred for the remainder of the project.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	Revisions to hour and cost estimates are incorporated in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	In certain situations when it is impractical for us to reliably estimate either specific amounts or ranges of contract revenues and costs, and where we anticipate that we will not incur a loss, a zero profit model is used for revenue re cognition.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	Equal amounts of revenue and cost are recognized during the contract period, and profit is recognized when the project is completed and accepted.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P8_S2	This method was used in 2013 and 2014 for two engineering service contracts in Japan.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P8_S3	The contracts were completed and accepted in the second and fourth quarters of 2014 and the profit from these contracts was recognized in 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	We also enter into arrangements in which a customer purchases a combination of software licenses, engineering services and post-contract customer support and/or maintenance ( PCS ).
1054721_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	As a result, contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting, including how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements if there are multiple elements.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	PCS may include rights to upgrades, when and if available, telephone support, updates and enhancements.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	When vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) of fair value exists for all elements in a multiple element arrangement, revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each of the elements.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	VSOE of fair value is established by the price charged when the same element is sold separately.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P11_S2	Accordingly, the judgments involved in assessing the fair values of various elements of an agreement can impact the recognition of revenue in each period.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P11_S3	Changes in the allocation of the sales price between deliverables might impact the timing of revenue recognition, but would not change the total revenue recognized on the contract.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	When elements such as software and engineering services are contained in a single arrangement, or in related arrangements with the same customer, we allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value, provided that such element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	In the absence of fair value for a delivered element, revenue is first allocated to the fair value of the undelivered elements and then allocated to the residual delivered elements.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P12_S2	In the absence of fair value for an undelivered element, the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting, resulting in a delay of revenue recognition for the delivered elements until the undelivered elements are fulfilled.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	When engineering services and royalties are contained in a single arrangement, we recognize revenue from engineering services as earned in accordance with the criteria above even though the effective rate per hour may be lower than typical because the customer is contractually obligated to pay royalties on their device shipments.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	We recognize royalty revenue, classified as software revenue, when the royalty report from the customer is received or when such royalties are contractually guaranteed and the other revenue recognition criteria are met, particularly that collectability is reasonably assured.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	There are two items involving revenue recognition that require us to make more difficult and subjective judgments: the determination of VSOE of fair value in multiple element arrangements and the estimation of percentage of completion on fixed-price service contracts.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	Historically, we have entered into very few multiple-element arrangements for proprietary software.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	We establish VSOE of fair value for proprietary software based on the price when PCS is sold separately.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	We establish VSOE of fair values for new proprietary software products for each separate product or service promised under a multiple-element contract, including software licenses, installation, training services and PCS.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	We measure our estimate of completion on fixed-price contracts, which in turn determines the amount of revenue we recognize, based primarily on actual hours incurred to date and our estimate of remaining hours necessary to complete the contract.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	The process of estimating the remaining hours on a contract involves detailed estimates of remaining hours by the engineers and project managers involved with the project, factoring in such variables as the remaining tasks, the complexity of the tasks, the contracted quality of the software to be provided, the customer s estimated delivery date, integration of third-party software and quality thereof and other factors.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	Every fixed-price contract requires various approvals within our company, including our Chief Executive Officer if significant.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	This approval process takes into consideration a number of factors including the complexity of engineering.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	Historically, our estimation processes related to fixed-price contracts have been accurate based on the information known at the time of the reporting of our results.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	However, percentage-of-completion estimates require significant judgment.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	As of December 31, 2015, we were delivering engineering services under six fixed-price service contracts.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	The percentage of completion calculations on these contracts represents management s best estimates based on the facts and circumstances as of the filing of this report.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P20_S2	If there are changes to the underlying facts and circumstances, revisions to the percentage-of-completion calculations will be recorded in the period the changes are noted.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P20_S3	For illustrative purposes only, if we were 10% under in our estimates of completion on every fixed-bid contract active on December 31, 2015, our revenue could have been over-stated by approximately $198,000 for 2015.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	Intangible Assets and Goodwill We evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	Our intangible assets were acquired through business acquisitions.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	Our intangible assets consist of customer relationships.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	Factors that could trigger an impairment analysis include significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	intangible asset may be impaired, we make an assessment of the recoverab ility of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P23_S1	If this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining useful life, we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P23_S2	Any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P23_S3	We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P23_S4	Our annual testing date is December 31.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P23_S5	We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P23_S6	If it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount, further testing of impairment is not performed.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	If it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, we perform a quantitative two-step impairment test.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	Our stock-based compensation expense for stock options is estimated at the grant date based on the stock award s fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton ( BSM ) option-pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P25_S1	The BSM model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and option life.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P25_S2	If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	Restricted stock units ( RSUs ) and restricted stock awards ( RSAs ) are measured based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant as determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience and expected future activity.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	To the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimates, stock-based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	Incentive Compensation We make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions regarding the likelihood of attainment, and the level thereof, of bonuses payable under our annual incentive compensation programs.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P28_S1	We accrue bonuses and recognize the resulting expense when the bonus is judged to be reasonably likely to be earned as of year-end and is estimable.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P28_S2	The amount accrued, and expense recognized, is the estimated portion of the bonus earned on a year-to-date basis less any amounts previously accrued.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P28_S3	These estimates, judgments and assumptions are made quarterly based on available information and take into consideration our year-to-date actual results and expected results for the remainder of the year.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P28_S4	Because we consider estimated future results in assessing the likelihood of attainment, significant judgment is required.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P28_S5	If actual results differ materially from our estimates, the amount of bonus expense recorded in a particular quarter could be significantly over or under estimated.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the countries and other jurisdictions in which we operate.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	This process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P29_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P29_S3	Net operating losses and tax credits, to the extent not already utilized to offset taxable income or income taxes, also give rise to deferred tax assets.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P29_S4	We must then assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income, and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	We apply the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740, Income Taxes, which requires us to use judgment as to the appropriate weighting of all available evidence when assessing the need for the establishment or the release of valuation allowances.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P30_S1	As part of this analysis, we examine all available evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis and weigh the positive and negative information when determining the need for full or partial valuation allowances.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P30_S2	The evidence considered for each jurisdiction includes, among other items, (i) the historic levels of income or loss over a range of time periods that extends beyond the two years presented, (ii) the historical sources of income and losses, (iii) the expectations and risk associated with underlying estimates of future taxable income, (iv) the expectations and risk associated with new product offerings and uncertainties with the timing of future taxable income, and (v) prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	We estimate the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	Our sales may be subject to other taxes, particularly withholding taxes, due to our sales to customers in countries other than the United States.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P32_S2	The tax regulations governing withholding taxes are complex, causing us to have to make assumptions about the appropriate tax treatment.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	We must therefore continue to analyze our state tax exposure and determine what the appropriate tax treatments are, and make estimates for sales, franchise, income and other state taxes.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	The following table presents certain financial data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	Our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	Our revenue is generated from the sale of software, both our own proprietary software and third-party software that we resell, and the sale of engineering services.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	Total revenue increased $10.7 million, or 11%, to $106.6 million in 2015 from $95.9 million in 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P36_S2	This increase was driven by higher sales of Windows Mobile and Embedded operating systems, an increase in engineering services revenue, as well as increases in our proprietary software revenue.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P36_S3	One customer, Honeywell International Inc., accounted for 16% of total revenue in 2015.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P36_S4	One customer, Future Electronics, Inc., accounted for 12% of total revenue in 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P36_S5	No other customers accounted for 10% or more of total revenue in either 2015 or 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P36_S6	Revenue from our customers outside of North America decreased $1.3 million, or 13%, to $8.7 million in 2015, from $10.0 million in 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P36_S7	Revenue from our customers outside of North America represented 8% of our total revenue in 2015, compared to 10% in 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P36_S8	The decrease in revenue from outside of North America in 2015 was primarily attributable to lower sales of Windows Mobile operating systems, lower engineering services revenue and lower proprietary software sales in Asia.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	Software revenue Software revenue consists of sales of third-party software and revenue realized from our own proprietary software products, which include software license sales, royalties from our software products, support and maintenance revenue, and royalties from certain engineering service contracts.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P37_S1	Software revenue for 2015 and 2014 was as follows (dollars in thousands):
1054721_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	The vast majority of our third-party software revenue is comprised of sales of Microsoft Embedded software and Windows Mobile operating systems.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P38_S1	Third-party software revenue increased $9.0 million, or 12%, in 2015 compared to 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P38_S2	The increase in third-party software revenue was driven primarily by an increase in both Microsoft Windows Embedded software sales and Windows Mobile sales partially offset by a reduction in sales of other third-party software.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P38_S3	Proprietary software revenue increased $1.0 million, or 44%, in 2015 compared to 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P38_S4	This was driven by several large purchases of our legacy products.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P38_S5	We expect that proprietary software revenue from our legacy products will continue to fluctuate in the future with generally lower overall volume in 2016 and beyond.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P38_S6	Service revenue Service revenue for 2015 and 2014 was as follows (dollars in thousands):
1054721_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	Service revenue increased $0.7 million, or 4%, in 2015 compared to 2014, due to increases in service revenue generated in North America offset partially by decreases in service revenue generated in both Asia and EMEA.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	The increase in North American service revenue was driven largely by a significant increase from an existing Fortune 500 customer as well as the addition of a new Fortune 500 customer, partially offset by decreases due to the completion of existing projects with customers.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P39_S2	The decrease in Asia was driven by the completion of two large handheld programs in 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P39_S3	Both programs were accounted for under the zero profit percentage of completion accounting method in which we recognized revenue during the project equal to our cost and recognized the remaining revenue, equal to the gross profit on the program, at completion.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P39_S4	We continue to work on the MyFord Touch, a project we began with Ford during the second quarter of 2008; however, we now conduct these services through an agreement with Microsoft and, as of 2014, an agreement with Elektrobit Automotive.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P39_S5	During the initial project with Ford, we provided hardware design and implementation, platform level software development, application level software development, quality assurance services and systems integration services.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P39_S6	The project has transitioned since the initial project such that we are now primarily focused on developing and integrating new user applications for the MyFord Touch, enhancing existing applications and customizing the MyFord Touch platform for additional vehicle models.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	The MyFord Touch program contributed $2.9 million in service revenue in 2015 compared to $2.8 million in 2014, an increase of $0.1 million or 4%.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	The decrease is attributable to a reduction in the number of engineers working on the MyFord Touch project as the amount of work on the increasingly mature platform has declined.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P40_S2	In December 2014, Ford introduced Sync 3, the next generation MyFord Touch program that is scheduled to be deployed on cars in 2016 and will be based on QNX software from Blackberry instead of software from Microsoft, and thus our role on the program has been scaled back.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P40_S3	We expect our role on MyFord Touch will continue to diminish or be eliminated because of the transition to QNX software for the next generation Sync 3 and our revenue and resulting gross profit will decline accordingly.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	p ersonnel resources from us in 2016 as Ford has decided to limit development efforts on the current generation of the Sync 2 platform , which will adversely impact our revenues and utilization rates beginning in the first half of 2016.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	Gross profit and gross margin Cost of software revenue consists primarily of the cost of third-party software products payable to third-party vendors and support costs associated with our proprietary software products.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P42_S1	Cost of service revenue consists primarily of salaries and benefits, contractor costs and re-billable expenses, related facilities and depreciation costs, and amortization of certain intangible assets related to acquisitions.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P42_S2	Gross profit on the sale of third-party software products is also positively impacted by rebate credits we receive from Microsoft for embedded software sales earned through the achievement of defined objectives.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P42_S3	Prior to the third quarter of 2013, the earned rebate amount was treated as a reduction in software cost of sales in the quarter earned.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P42_S4	Beginning in the third quarter of 2013, as a result of program modifications, we began treating a portion of the rebate as marketing development funds which are accounted for as a reduction in marketing expense if and when qualified program expenditures are made.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P42_S5	Under this rebate program, we recognized $326,000 and $298,000 of rebate credits in 2015 and 2014, respectively, which were accounted for as reductions in cost of sales.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P42_S6	We received $888,000 and $195,000 in rebates during 2015 and 2014, respectively, which were accounted for as reductions in marketing expenses.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P42_S7	There was a balance of $641,000 in outstanding rebate credits we qualified for as of December 31, 2015, which will be accounted for as reductions in marketing expense if and when qualified program expenditures are made.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	The following table outlines software, services and total gross profit (dollars in thousands):
1054721_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	Software gross profit and gross margin Software gross profit increased by $3.5 million, or 30%, in 2015 compared to 2014, while software gross margin increased by three percentage points to 18% in 2015 from 15% in 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P44_S1	Third-party software gross margin was 15% in 2015, compared to 14% in 2014 driven largely by improvements in gross margin on Microsoft Windows Embedded sales as a result of operational efficiencies, favorable product and customer mix, increased sales to an existing customer with extended payment terms and the timing of completion of customer contractual commitments.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P44_S2	Proprietary software gross margin was 85% in 2015 compared to 75% in 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P44_S3	Proprietary software revenue increased by 44%, and margins improved as a result of the relatively fixed software cost of sales for these products.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P44_S4	Service gross profit and gross margin Service gross profit increased $0.4 million, or 9%, in 2015 compared to 2014 driven by a $0.7 million increase in service revenue offset by a $0.3 million increase in service cost of sales.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P44_S5	Service gross margin was 25% in 2015, a one percentage point increase from 24% in 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P44_S6	The increase in service gross margin was driven primarily by an improvement in utilization as well as the cost reduction effort initiated during the fourth quarter of 2013.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	Operating expenses Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, commissions and bonuses for our sales, marketing and administrative personnel and related facilities and depreciation costs, as well as professional services fees (e.g., consulting, legal, audit and tax).
1054721_16_ITEM7_P45_S1	Selling, general and administrative expenses were essentially flat at $12.4 million in 2015 and 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	marketing expenses which are accounted for as a reduction in marketing expense s when received , partially offset by higher commi ssion and bonus expense s as wel l as higher stock- based compensation costs in 2015 .
1054721_16_ITEM7_P46_S1	Sel ling, general and administrative expenses represented approximately 11% of our total revenue in 2015 co mpared to approximately 13% of revenue in 2014 .
1054721_16_ITEM7_P46_S2	Research and development Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for software development and quality assurance personnel, contractor and consultant costs and related facilities and depreciation costs.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P46_S3	Research and development expenses decreased $41,000, or 2%, to $1.6 million in 2015, from $1.7 million in 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P46_S4	Research and development expenses represented approximately 2% of total revenue in both 2015 and 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P46_S5	Research and development expenses are expensed when incurred.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P46_S6	Other income (expense), net Other income (expense) consists of interest income on our cash and investments, gains and losses we may recognize on our investments, gains and losses on foreign exchange transactions and other items.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P46_S7	Net other income was $132,000 in 2015 compared to net other expense of $101,000 in 2014, representing a change of $233,000.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P46_S8	This change was a result of more favorable foreign currency transactions in 2015 compared to those in 2014 and by higher interest income recorded in 2015 compared to 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	Income taxes Income tax expense was $470,000 in 2015, based on income before tax of $6.6 million.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P47_S1	Our effective tax rate in 2015 was 7.1% and in 2014 was 1.6%, both of which are below the statutory rate of 34%, primarily due to the full valuation allowance on U.S. deferred tax assets.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P47_S2	Income tax expense was $38,000 in 2014, based on income before tax of $2.4 million.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	We apply the guidance of ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires us to use judgment as to the appropriate weighting of all available evidence when assessing the need for the establishment or the release of valuation allowances.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	As part of this analysis, we examine all available evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis and weigh the positive and negative information when determining the need for full or partial valuation allowances.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P48_S2	The evidence considered for each jurisdiction includes, among other items, (i) the historic levels of income or loss over a range of time periods that extends beyond the two years presented, (ii) the historical sources of income and losses, (iii) the expectations and risk associated with underlying estimates of future taxable income, (iv) the expectations and risk associated with new product offerings and uncertainties with the timing of future taxable income, and (v) prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	Based on the analysis conducted as of December 31, 2015, we determined that we would not release, in full or in part, the valuation allowance against our U.S. gross deferred tax assets.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P49_S1	In addition, we determined that a partial increase in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in Japan of $100,000 was warranted.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2015, we had $30.0 million of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash, compared to $26.6 million at December 31, 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P50_S1	Of these amounts, $16.4 million and $13.1 million were classified as cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, Restricted cash is classified as long term and was $250,000 at both December 31, 2015 and 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P50_S2	This cash is restricted under the terms of our headquarters operating lease which will continue to secure that obligation through its expiration in 2020.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P50_S3	Our working capital was $32.2 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $23.7 million at December 31, 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P50_S4	Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.9 million in 2015, driven by our net income of $6.1 million and non-cash expenses of $2.3 million, offset by negative net working capital changes of $5.5 million (which were primarily composed of an increase in accounts receivable of $5.4 million).
1054721_16_ITEM7_P50_S5	Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.3 million in 2014, driven by our net income of $2.3 million, positive net working capital changes of $1.4 million and non-cash expenses of $1.6 million.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P50_S6	Net cash used for investing activities was $0.3 million in 2015, due to fixed asset purchases.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P50_S7	Maturities of short-term investments of $25.1 million were fully reinvested, resulting in no net change in cash due to purchases and sales of our investment portfolio.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P50_S8	Net cash used for investing activities was $6.3 million in 2014, resulting from purchases in short-term investments exceeding maturities by $6.0 million and $0.3 million in fixed asset purchases.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P50_S9	Financing activities generated $716,000 in 2015 and $666,000 in 2014 resulting from the exercise of stock options.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments will be sufficient to meet our needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	with a commensurate decrease in cash and/or short-term investment balances.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	In September 2015 we entered into a two -year unsecured line of credit agreement in the principal amount of up to $12 million .
1054721_16_ITEM7_P53_S1	No amounts were drawn or outstanding as of December 31, 2015.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P53_S2	See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 12, Credit Agreement, for more information re garding this agreement.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	We have the following future or potential cash commitments:
1054721_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	In conjunction with our activities under our ODAs with Microsoft, we enter OVRP commitments with Microsoft.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P55_S1	Under these OVRPs, we are provided with volume pricing on a customer-by-customer basis assuming certain minimum unit volumes are met.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P55_S2	The OVRP terms are 12 months.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P55_S3	In the event we do not meet the committed minimum unit volumes, we are obligated to pay the difference between the committed per-unit volume rate and the actual per-unit rate we achieved based upon actual units purchased.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P55_S4	The OVRP arrangements do not equate to a minimum purchase commitment but rather, the arrangements are a volume pricing arrangement based upon actual volume purchased.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P55_S5	In substantially all instances, we have reciprocal agreements with our customers such that we will receive per-unit price adjustments, similar to the amounts we would subsequently owe to Microsoft if such OVRP volumes are not met.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P55_S6	However, in the event a customer is unwilling or unable to pay us, we would be negatively impacted.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P55_S7	Based upon the credit-worthiness of our customers, our historical OVRP experience with our customers and OVRP arrangements in general, we do not believe we will incur any material liability in the current or future periods.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	Recent Developments Microsoft has implemented significant pricing changes for its embedded products, including ending its design registration pricing discounts, terminating its OVRP and changing the aggregate volume price structure and product royalties for existing embedded Windows products effective January 1, 2016.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P56_S1	These changes to design registration pricing discounts will alter the competitive dynamics because the same pricing discounts will be available to all distributors of these Microsoft products.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P56_S2	As a distributor of Microsoft products, this will impact both the sales prices we charge our customers and the cost of goods sold we incur for many of the Microsoft products we sell.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P56_S3	At this time, the amount and impact of these upcoming changes to our revenue and gross profit are not determinable; however, they may negatively impact our operating results beginning in 2016.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P56_S4	However, during December 2015, we entered into transition OVRP agreements with Microsoft and a majority of our customers that extended the 2015 pricing for all of 2016.
1054721_16_ITEM7_P56_S5	The sale of Microsoft operating systems represented approximately 75% and 73% of our total revenue and approximately 56% and 52% of our total gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1054721_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data .
1054721_16_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BSQUARE Corporation (the Corporation ) as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, shareholders equity and cash flows for the years then ended.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P1_S1	These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation s management.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P1_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P2_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1054721_16_ITEM8_P2_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P2_S2	The Corporation is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P2_S3	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P2_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P3_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P3_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P4_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of BSQUARE Corporation as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1054721_16_ITEM8_P9_S0	Description of Business BSQUARE Corporation ( BSQUARE ) was incorporated in Washington State in July 1994.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P9_S1	We provide software solutions and related engineering services to companies that develop smart, connected systems.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P10_S0	A smart, connected system is a dedicated purpose computing device that typically has a display, runs an operating system (e.g., Microsoft Windows CE) and is usually connected to a network or data cloud via a wired or wireless connection.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P10_S1	Examples of smart, connected systems include set-top boxes, home gateways, point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, voting machines, gaming platforms, tablets, handheld data collection devices, personal media players, smart phones, smart vending machines and in-vehicle telematics and entertainment devices.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P10_S2	We focus on smart, connected systems that utilize Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems as well as devices running other popular operating systems such as Android, Linux, and QNX.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P10_S3	We have been providing software solutions for smart, connected systems since our inception.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P10_S4	Our customers include world class original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ), original design manufacturers ( ODMs ) and corporate enterprises ( Enterprises ), as well as silicon vendors ( SVs ) and peripheral vendors which purchase our software solutions for purposes of facilitating processor and peripheral sales.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P10_S5	In the case of Enterprises, our customers include those which develop, market and distribute smart, connected systems on their own behalf as well as those that purchase systems from OEMs or ODMs and require additional software, integration and/or testing.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P10_S6	The software solutions we provide are utilized and deployed throughout various phases of our customers device life cycle, including design, development, customization, quality assurance and deployment.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P11_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of BSQUARE and our wholly owned subsidiaries.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P11_S1	All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P12_S0	Use of Estimates Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P12_S1	Examples include provisions for bad debts and income taxes, estimates of progress on professional engineering service arrangements, bonus accruals, fair value of intangible assets and property and equipment, fair values of stock-based awards and the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities, among other estimates.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P12_S2	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P13_S0	Basic income or loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, and excludes any dilutive effects of common stock equivalent shares, such as options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and warrants.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P13_S1	Restricted stock awards ( RSAs ) are considered outstanding and included in the computation of basic income or loss per share when underlying restrictions expire and the awards are no longer forfeitable.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P13_S2	Restricted stock units ( RSUs ) are considered outstanding and included in the computation of basic income or loss per share only when vested.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P13_S3	Diluted income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P13_S4	Common stock equivalent shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is anti-dilutive.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P13_S5	Unvested but outstanding RSUs and RSAs (which are forfeitable) are included in the diluted income per share calculation.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P14_S0	In a period where we are in a net loss position, the diluted loss per share is computed using the basic share count.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P15_S0	The following table presents a reconciliation of the number of shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted income (l oss) per share (in thousands):
1054721_16_ITEM8_P16_S0	Common stock equivalent shares of 213,820 and 901,069 were excluded from the computations of basic and diluted income per share for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, because their effect was anti-dilutive.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P17_S0	Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments We invest our excess cash primarily in highly liquid debt instruments of U.S. government agencies and municipalities, debt instruments issued by foreign governments, corporate commercial paper, money market funds, and corporate debt securities.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P17_S1	We classify all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months as short-term investments.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P17_S2	Short-term investments consist entirely of marketable securities which are all classified as available-for-sale securities and are recorded at their estimated fair value.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P17_S3	We determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P17_S4	We may or may not hold securities with stated maturities greater than 12 months until maturity.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P17_S5	As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify securities with maturities beyond 12 months as short-term investments.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P17_S6	We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of stockholders equity, except for unrealized losses determined to be other than temporary which are recorded in other expense.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P18_S0	Restricted Cash Our restricted cash represents funds held at a financial institution as security for an outstanding letter of credit expiring in 2020 related to our corporate headquarters lease obligation.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P19_S0	Financial Instruments and Concentrations of Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts receivable.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P20_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We record accounts receivable at the invoiced amount net of an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P20_S1	We review customers which are past due to identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P20_S2	In determining the amount of the allowance, we make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P21_S0	Equipment, Furniture and Leasehold Improvements We account for equipment, furniture and leasehold improvements at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P21_S1	We compute depreciation of equipment and furniture using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three years.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P22_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful lives, ranging from two to ten years.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P22_S1	Maintenance and repairs costs are expensed as incurred.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P23_S0	When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, gains or losses are included in the consolidated statements of income.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P24_S0	When facts and circumstances indicate that the value of long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying value of the asset to projected undiscounted future cash flows.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P24_S1	Upon indication that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss as a charge against current operations based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P25_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets were recorded as a result of business acquisitions and are stated at estimated fair value at the time of acquisition less accumulated amortization.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P26_S0	We amortize our acquired intangible assets using the straight-line method using lives ranging from one to ten years.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P27_S0	We review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P27_S1	We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P28_S0	If intangible assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P29_S0	Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter annually, or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P29_S1	We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P29_S2	If it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount, no further testing is performed.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P30_S0	If it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, we perform a quantitative two-step impairment test.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P31_S0	The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P31_S1	If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P32_S0	We record all fees payable and accrued liabilities related to the sale of third-party software, such as Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, as third-party software fees payable.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P33_S0	Research and Development Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P33_S1	Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs would be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P34_S0	Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P34_S1	Generally this would be reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing, and would occur shortly before the product is released.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P34_S2	Amortization of costs incurred after this point would be included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P34_S3	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we have not recorded any such capitalized costs.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P35_S0	Advertising Costs All costs of advertising, including cooperative marketing arrangements, are expensed as incurred.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P35_S1	Advertising expense was $23,000 in 2015 and $558,000 in 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P36_S0	The estimated fair value of stock based awards is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the award, net of estimated forfeitures.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P37_S0	We estimate forfeitures of stock based awards based on historical experience and expected future activity.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P37_S1	The fair value of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P37_S2	The fair value of stock option awards are estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of each vesting tranche as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton ( BSM ) option-pricing model.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P37_S3	The BSM model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and option life.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P37_S4	If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P38_S0	Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income refers to net income and other revenue, expenses, gains and losses that, under generally accepted accounting principles, are recorded as an element of shareholders equity but are excluded from the calculation of net income.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P39_S0	Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P39_S1	Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P40_S0	provided for on the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P40_S1	Our deferred tax amounts are measured using currently enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the y ears in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P40_S2	We apply the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740, Income Taxes, which requires us to use judgment as to the appropriate weighting of all available evidence when assessing the need for the establishment or the release of valuation allowances.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P40_S3	As part of this analysis, we examine all available evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis and weigh the positive and negative information when determining the need for full or partial valuation allowances.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P40_S4	The evidence considered for each jurisdiction includes, among other items, (i) the historic levels of income or loss over a range of time periods that extends beyond the two years presented, (ii) the historical sources of income and losses, (iii) the expectations and risk associated with underlying estimates of future taxable income, (iv) the expectations and risk associated with new product offerings and uncertainties with the timing of future taxable income, and (v) prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P41_S0	Based on the analysis conducted as of December 31, 2015, we determined that we would not release, in full or in part, the valuation allowance against our U.S. gross deferred tax assets.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P41_S1	In addition, we determined that a partial increase in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in Japan of $100,000 was warranted.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P41_S2	We recognize tax benefits from an uncertain position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based on its technical merits.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P41_S3	The tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P41_S4	Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are classified in the consolidated financial statements as income tax expense.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P42_S0	The functional currency of foreign subsidiaries is their local currency.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P42_S1	Accordingly, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P42_S2	Resulting translation adjustments are included in Other Comprehensive Income and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss , a separate component of shareholders equity.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P43_S0	The net gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are recorded in the period incurred and were not significant for any of the periods presented.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P44_S0	Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from software and engineering service sales when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the selling price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P44_S1	Contracts and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P44_S2	Shipping documents and time records are generally used to verify delivery.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P44_S3	We assess whether the selling price is fixed or determinable based on the contract and/or customer purchase order and payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P44_S4	We assess collectability based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer s payment history.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P44_S5	Periodically, we will begin work on engineering service engagements prior to having a signed contract and, in some cases, the contract is signed in a quarter after which service delivery costs are incurred.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P44_S6	We do not defer costs associated with such engagements before we have received a signed contract.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P44_S7	In certain rare circumstances we will grant extended terms to highly credit-worthy customers.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P44_S8	The terms we offer are fixed and determinable; they are for sales of perpetual software licenses, they do not exceed twelve months in duration, they do not include multiple element arrangements requiring post-contract support, they do not permit returns or exchanges past thirty days and they do not require any additional services be provided by us.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P44_S9	We recognize software revenue upon shipment provided that no significant obligations remain on our part, substantive acceptance conditions, if any, have been met and the other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P45_S0	Service revenue from time and materials contracts, and training service agreements, is recognized as services are performed.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P45_S1	Fixed-price service agreements, and certain time and materials service agreements with capped fee structures, are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method assuming reasonable estimates of completion can be made.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P46_S0	We use the percentage-of-completion method of accounting because we believe it is the most accurate method to recognize revenue based on the nature and scope of these engineering service contracts; we believe it is a better measure of periodic income results than other methods and it better matches revenue recognized with the costs incurred.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P46_S1	Percentage of completion is measured based primarily on input measures such as hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P47_S0	incurred for the remainder of the project.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P48_S0	Revisions to hour and cost estimates are incorporated in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P49_S0	In certain situations when it is impractical for us to reliably estimate either specific amounts or ranges of contract revenues and costs, and where we anticipate that we will not incur a loss, a zero profit model is used for revenue recognition.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P49_S1	Equal amounts of revenue and cost are recognized during the contract period, and profit is recognized when the project is completed and accepted.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P49_S2	This method was used in 2013 and 2014 for two engineering service contracts in Japan completed in 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P50_S0	We also enter into arrangements in which a customer purchases a combination of software licenses, engineering services and post-contract customer support and/or maintenance ( PCS ).
1054721_16_ITEM8_P50_S1	As a result, judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting, including how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements if there are multiple elements.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P51_S0	PCS may include rights to upgrades, when and if available, telephone support, updates and enhancements.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P52_S0	When vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) of fair value exists for all elements in a multiple element arrangement, revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each of the elements.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P52_S1	VSOE of fair value is established by the price charged when the same element is sold separately.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P52_S2	Accordingly, the judgments involved in assessing the fair values of various elements of an agreement can impact the recognition of revenue in each period.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P52_S3	Changes in the allocation of the sales price between deliverables might impact the timing of revenue recognition, but would not change the total revenue recognized on the contract.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P53_S0	When elements such as software and engineering services are contained in a single arrangement, or in related arrangements with the same customer, we allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value, provided that such element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P53_S1	In the absence of fair value for a delivered element, revenue is first allocated to the fair value of the undelivered elements and then allocated to the residual delivered elements.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P53_S2	In the absence of fair value for an undelivered element, the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting, resulting in a delay of revenue recognition for the delivered elements until the undelivered elements are fulfilled.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P54_S0	When engineering services and royalties are contained in a single arrangement, we recognize revenue from engineering services as earned in accordance with the criteria above even though the effective rate per hour may be lower than typical because the customer is contractually obligated to pay royalties on their device shipments.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P54_S1	We recognize royalty revenue, classified as software revenue, when the royalty report from the customer is received or when such royalties are contractually guaranteed and the other revenue recognition criteria are met, particularly the criteria that collectability is reasonably assured.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P54_S2	Revenue is recognized net of any applicable sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P54_S3	Shipping and handling costs are generally billed to customers and are included in cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of income.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P55_S0	No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , amending revenue recognition guidance and requiring more detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P55_S1	The guidance, as amended, is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for public companies effective from annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2016.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P55_S2	We are currently evaluating the impact this ASU may have on our consolidated financial statements.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P56_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P56_S1	The amendments in this standard require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P57_S0	The amendments in this standard apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P57_S1	The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this standard.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P57_S2	We adopted the new guidance retrospectively beginning with the year ended December 31, 2014, and applied such guidance consistently for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P57_S3	The adoption of this update resulted in the reclassification of a current deferred tax asset of $10,000 to a noncurrent deferred tax asset on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P58_S0	Cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash consist of the following (in thousands):
1054721_16_ITEM8_P59_S0	Gross unrealized gains and losses on our cash equivalents and short-term investments were not material as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P59_S1	Our restricted cash balance at December 31, 2015 and 2014 relates to a letter of credit securing the lease of our corporate headquarters.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P60_S0	We measure our cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash at fair value.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P61_S0	Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P61_S1	As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P61_S2	A three-tier fair value hierarchy is established as a basis for considering such assumptions and for inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:
1054721_16_ITEM8_P62_S0	Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P63_S0	Directly or indirectly observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs used in models or other valuation methodologies.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P64_S0	Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P64_S1	The inputs require significant management judgment or estimation.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P65_S0	We classify our cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash within Level 1 or Level 2.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P65_S1	This is because we value these items using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs that are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including third-party pricing services, brokers and market transactions.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P65_S2	We review the pricing techniques and methodologies of the independent pricing service for Level 2 investments and believe that the policies adequately consider market activity, either based on specific transactions for the security valued or based on modeling of securities with similar credit quality, duration, yield and structure that were recently traded.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P66_S0	Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in thousands):
1054721_16_ITEM8_P67_S0	Equipment, furniture, and leasehold improvements consist of the following (in thousands):
1054721_16_ITEM8_P68_S0	Depreciation and amortization expense of equipment, furniture and leasehold improvements was $440,000 in 2015 and $491,000 in 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P68_S1	We did not have any asset write-offs in 2015.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P68_S2	We wrote off approximately $1.3 million of assets with remaining net book value of $33,000 in 2014, primarily in conjunction with our move to new facilities.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P69_S0	Goodwill was recorded in connection with the September 2011 acquisition of MPC Data, Ltd. (renamed BSQUARE EMEA Limited in 2015), a United Kingdom based provider of software engineering services.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P69_S1	The excess of the acquisition consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P70_S0	BSQUARE operates as a single reporting unit, and BSQUARE EMEA, Ltd. falls within that reporting unit.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P70_S1	There was no change in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P71_S0	Intangible assets relate to customer relationships that we acquired from TestQuest, Inc. in November 2008 and from the acquisition of BSQUARE EMEA, Ltd. in September 2011.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P71_S1	Information regarding our intangible assets is as follows (in thousands):
1054721_16_ITEM8_P72_S0	Amortization expense was $135,000 and $134,000 for 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P72_S1	As of December 31, 2015, expected amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets for each of the next five years and thereafter is as follows (in thousands):
1054721_16_ITEM8_P73_S0	The components of other income (expense), net are as follows (in thousands):
1054721_16_ITEM8_P74_S0	Income before income taxes consists of the following (in thousands):
1054721_16_ITEM8_P75_S0	Income tax expense consists of the following (in thousands):
1054721_16_ITEM8_P76_S0	The components of net deferred tax assets consist of the following (in thousands):
1054721_16_ITEM8_P77_S0	Our net deferred tax assets are recorded as follows (in thousands):
1054721_16_ITEM8_P78_S0	As of December 31, 2015, our deferred tax assets were primarily the result of U.S. net operating loss and R D credit carryforwards.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P78_S1	We have applied a full valuation allowance against the U.S. deferred tax assets and a partial valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in Japan.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P78_S2	Valuation allowances of $24.6 million and $26.8 million have been recorded against our gross deferred tax asset balance as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P79_S0	We apply the guidance of ASC 740, which requires us to use judgment as to the appropriate weighting of all available evidence when assessing the need for the establishment or the release of valuation allowances.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P79_S1	As part of this analysis, we examine all available evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis and weigh the positive and negative information when determining the need for full or partial valuation allowances.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P79_S2	The evidence considered for each jurisdiction includes, among other items, (i) the historic levels of income or loss over a range of time periods that extends beyond the two years presented, (ii) the historical sources of income and losses, (iii) the expectations and risk associated with underlying estimates of future taxable income, (iv) the expectations and risk associated with new product offerings and uncertainties with the timing of future taxable income, and (v) prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P80_S0	Based on the analysis conducted as of December 31, 2015, we determined that we would not release, in full or in part, the valuation allowance against our U.S. gross deferred tax assets.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P80_S1	In addition, we determined that a partial increase in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in Japan of $100,000 was warranted.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P81_S0	The provision for income taxes differs from the amount of expec ted income tax expense determined by applying the applicable U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to pre-tax income , as a result of the following (in thousands, except percentages):
1054721_16_ITEM8_P82_S0	At December 31, 2015, we had approximately $54.4 million of federal and $1.6 million of state net operating loss carryforwards, which have begun to expire, including $0.2 million of state losses in 2017.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P82_S1	Of the federal net operating loss carryforwards, an aggregate of $36.4 million will expire in 2022 and 2023.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P82_S2	We also have $2.7 million of tax credit carryforwards, which begin to expire in 2018.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P82_S3	Use of these carryforwards may subject us to an annual limitation due to Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code which restricts the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use its carryforwards.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P83_S0	Under the applicable tax rules, an ownership change occurs if holders of more than five percent of an issuer s outstanding common stock, collectively, increase their ownership percentage by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P83_S1	We have performed analyses of possible ownership changes in the past, which included consideration of third-party studies, and do not believe that an ownership change of more than 50 percentage points has occurred.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P83_S2	We have evaluated all the material income tax positions taken on our income tax filings to various tax authorities, and we determined that we did not have unrealized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions recorded at December 31, 2015 or 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P83_S3	Because of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, substantially all of our tax years remain open and subject to examination.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P84_S0	Contingencies A third-party software vendor invoiced us a total of $934,000 for certain licensed software that was lost in transit by a common carrier during the second quarter of 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P84_S1	We accrued a liability of $100,000 in the second quarter of 2014 as an estimate of our potential liability for legal and insurance deductible expenses.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P84_S2	During the first quarter of 2015, the vendor credited our account for the full $934,000 as the licenses had been deactivated and there was no indication of counterfeit use.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P84_S3	Accordingly, we reversed approximately $85,000 of the accrual after payment of legal expenses in the first quarter of 2015.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P84_S4	Our commitments include obligations outstanding under operating leases, which expire through 2020.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P84_S5	We have lease commitments for office space in Bellevue, Washington; Taipei, Taiwan; Trowbridge, UK; and Tokyo, Japan.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P84_S6	We also lease office space on a month-to-month basis in Akron, Ohio; and on an annual basis in San Diego, California; and Boston, Massachusetts.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P84_S7	In August 2013, we amended the lease agreement for our Bellevue, Washington headquarters and extended the term of the original lease that was scheduled to expire in August 2014 to May 2020.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P84_S8	Rent expense was $1.1 million in 2015 and $1.2 million in 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P84_S9	As of December 31, 2015, we had $250,000 pledged as collateral for a bank letter of credit under the terms of our headquarters facility lease.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P84_S10	The pledged cash supporting the outstanding letter of credit is recorded as restricted cash equivalents.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P85_S0	Operating lease commitments at December 31, 2015 are as follows (in thousands):
1054721_16_ITEM8_P86_S0	Volume Pricing Agreements In conjunction with our activities under the OEM Distribution Agreements ( ODAs ) with Microsoft Corporation ( Microsoft ), we enter into OEM Volume Royalty Program ( OVRP ) commitments with Microsoft.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P86_S1	Under these OVRPs, we are provided with volume pricing on a customer-by-customer basis assuming certain minimum unit volumes are met.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P86_S2	The OVRP terms are 12 months.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P86_S3	In the event we do not meet the committed minimum unit volumes, we are obligated to pay the difference between the committed per-unit volume rate and the actual per-unit rate we achieved based upon actual units purchased.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P86_S4	The OVRP arrangements do not equate to a minimum purchase commitment but rather, the arrangements are a volume pricing arrangement based upon actual volume purchased.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P86_S5	In substantially all instances, we have reciprocal agreements with our customers such that we will receive per-unit price adjustments, similar to the amounts we would subsequently owe to Microsoft if such OVRP volumes are not met.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P86_S6	However, in the event a customer is unwilling or unable to pay us, we would be negatively impacted.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P86_S7	Based upon the credit-worthiness of our customers, our historical OVRP experience with our customers and OVRP arrangements in general, we do not believe we will incur any material liability in the current or future periods relating to existing agreements.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P87_S0	Microsoft is in the process of implementing significant pricing changes for its embedded products, including ending its design registration pricing discounts, terminating its OVRP and changing the aggregate volume price structure and product royalties for existing embedded Windows products effective January 1, 2016.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P87_S1	In December 2015, Microsoft granted extensions for certain of the OVRPs through 2016.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P88_S0	Equity Compensation Plans We have a stock plan (the Stock Plan ) and an inducement stock plan for newly hired employees (the Inducement Plan ) (collectively the Plans ).
1054721_16_ITEM8_P88_S1	Under the Plans, stock options may be granted with a fixed exercise price that is equivalent to fair market value on the date of grant.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P88_S2	These options have a term of up to 10 years and vest over predetermined periods, generally one to four years.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P88_S3	Incentive stock options granted under the Stock Plan may only be granted to our employees.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P88_S4	The Plans also allow for awards of non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSAs and unrestricted stock awards, and RSUs.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P88_S5	The estimated fair value of stock-based awards is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the award, net of estimated forfeitures.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P89_S0	We estimate forfeitures of stock based awards based on historical experience and expected future activity.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P90_S0	The fair value of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P90_S1	The fair value of stock option awards are estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of each vesting tranche as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton ( BSM ) option-pricing model.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P90_S2	The BSM model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and option life.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P90_S3	If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P91_S0	The fair values of our equity awards, primarily stock option grants, were estimated with the following weighted average assumptions:
1054721_16_ITEM8_P92_S0	The impact on our results of operations of recording stock-based compensation expense was as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):
1054721_16_ITEM8_P93_S0	The following table summarizes stock option activity under the Plans for 2015 and 2014:
1054721_16_ITEM8_P94_S0	At December 31, 2015, total compensation cost related to stock options granted under the Plans but not yet recognized was $1,326,412, net of estimated forfeitures.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P94_S1	This cost will be amortized on the straight-line method over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.26 years.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P95_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the quoted price of our common stock for the number of options that were in-the-money at year end.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P96_S0	We issue new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P97_S0	The following table summarizes certain information about stock options:
1054721_16_ITEM8_P98_S0	The following table summarizes restricted stock unit activity under the Stock Plan for 2015 and 2014:
1054721_16_ITEM8_P99_S0	At December 31, 2015, total compensation cost related to restricted stock units granted under the Stock Plan but not yet recognized was $357,040, net of estimated forfeitures.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P99_S1	This cost will be amortized on the straight-line method over a period of approximately 1.34 years.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P99_S2	Common Stock Reserved for Future Issuance The following table summarizes our shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under the Plans:
1054721_16_ITEM8_P100_S0	We have a Profit Sharing and Deferred Compensation Plan, The BSQUARE Corporation 401(k) Plan and Trust, (the Profit Sharing Plan ) under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P101_S0	Substantially all full-time employees are eligible to participate in the Profit Sharing Plan.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P101_S1	We typically elect to match the participants contributions to the Profit Sharing Plan up to a certain amount subject to vesting.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P101_S2	Participants will receive their share of the value of their investments, and any applicable vested match, upon retirement or termination.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P101_S3	We made matching contributions of $269,000 in 2015 and $243,000 in 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P101_S4	Of the annual matching contributions, $26,000 of the 2015 and $114,000 of the 2014 contributions were composed of transfers from the Profit Sharing Plan s forfeiture account.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P102_S0	Significant Customer One customer, Honeywell International Inc., accounted for 16% of total revenue in 2015.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P102_S1	One customer, Future Electronics, Inc., accounted for 12% of total revenue in 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P102_S2	No other customers accounted for 10% or more of total revenue in either 2015 or 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P102_S3	Honeywell International, Inc. and affiliated entities had total accounts receivable balances of $6.1 million, or 32% of total accounts receivable, as of December 31, 2015.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P102_S4	No other customer accounted for 10% or more of total accounts receivable at December 31, 2015 or 2014.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P103_S0	Significant Supplier We have two ODAs with Microsoft which enable us to sell Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems to our customers in the United States, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, the Caribbean, the European Union, the European Free Trade Association, Turkey and Africa, which expire on June 30, 2016.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P103_S1	We also have four ODAs with Microsoft which allow us to sell Microsoft Windows Mobile operating systems in the Americas (excluding Cuba), Japan, Taiwan, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, which also expire on June 30, 2016.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P103_S2	Software sales under these agreements constitute a significant portion of our software revenue and total revenue.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P103_S3	These agreements are typically renewed annually or semi-annually; however, there is no automatic renewal provision in any of these agreements.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P103_S4	Further, these agreements can be terminated unilaterally by Microsoft at any time.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P104_S0	Microsoft currently offers a rebate program to sell Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems pursuant to which we earn money for achieving certain predefined objectives.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P104_S1	Prior to the third quarter of 2013, the earned rebate amount was treated as a reduction in software cost of sales in the quarter earned.
1054721_16_ITEM8_P104_S2	Beginning in the third quarter of 2013, as a result of program modifications, we began treating a portion of the rebate as marketing development funds which are accounted for as a reduction in marketing expense if and when qualified program expenditures are made.

1054721_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1054721_16_ITEM9A_P0_S1	In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as of December 31, 2015, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.
1054721_16_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2015.
1054721_16_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
1054721_16_ITEM9A_P0_S4	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1054721_16_ITEM9A_P0_S5	Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act and includes those policies and procedures that: (a) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (b) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (c) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
1054721_16_ITEM9A_P0_S6	All internal controls, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
1054721_16_ITEM9A_P0_S7	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
1054721_16_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015.
1054721_16_ITEM9A_P1_S1	In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) .

1054721_17_ITEM1_P0_S0	CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the safe-harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P1_S0	Forward-looking statements can often be identified by words such as: "expect," "believe," "estimate," "plan," "strategy," "future," "potential," "continue," "may," "should," "will," and similar references to future periods.

1054721_17_ITEM1_P2_S0	Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances about future performance.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P2_S1	Instead, they are only predictions, based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions about the future of our business and other future conditions.

1054721_17_ITEM1_P2_S7	Our forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P2_S8	We discuss many of these risks, uncertainties and other factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in greater detail under the Item 1A Risk Factors.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P2_S9	We caution readers that our business and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P2_S10	BUSINESS Overview As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we, us , our , the Company and BSQUARE refer to BSQUARE Corporation.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P3_S0	Since our inception, our business has largely been focused on providing software solutions (historically including reselling software from Microsoft Corporation ( Microsoft )) and related engineering services to businesses that develop, market and sell dedicated purpose standalone intelligent systems.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P3_S1	Examples of dedicated purpose standalone intelligent systems include smart, connected computing devices such as smart phones, set-top boxes, point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, tablets and handheld data collection devices, as well as smart vending machines, ATM machines, digital signs and in-vehicle telematics and entertainment devices.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	We focus on systems that utilize various Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems as well as devices running other popular operating systems such as Android, Linux, and QNX, and that are usually connected to a network or data cloud via a wired or wireless connection.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P4_S1	Our customers include world-class original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ), original design manufacturers ( ODMs ), corporate enterprises ( Enterprises ), silicon vendors ( SVs ) and peripheral vendors.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P4_S2	A significant portion of our business historically has also been focused on reselling software from Microsoft, from which a majority of our revenue currently continues to be derived.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P5_S0	Beginning in early 2014, we initiated development efforts focused on new proprietary software products addressing the Internet of Things ( IoT ) market, which is the interconnection of uniquely identifiable embedded computing devices within the existing internet infrastructure.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P5_S1	While IoT is a relatively new market, we believe the work we have engaged in since our inception namely adding intelligence and connectivity to discrete standalone devices and systems embodies much of what is central to the core functionality of IoT. These software development efforts have driven a new business initiative for BSQUARE, which we refer to as DataV .
1054721_17_ITEM1_P5_S2	Our DataV solution includes software products, applications and services that are designed to render raw IoT device data into meaningful and actionable data for our customers.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P5_S3	We launched DataV late in the first quarter of 2016 and announced our first three major customer bookings later that year.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P5_S4	These bookings comprised software licensing, software maintenance and related systems integration services and are, we believe, indicative of the potential customer demand for DataV.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	We believe that DataV presents high growth opportunities in a large, expanding addressable market, at substantially higher gross margins as compared to our traditional busine ss.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P6_S1	Over time, we intend for DataV to become our primary focus, representing a transition away from dependence on resale software and engineering services toward increased reliance on our own proprietary software and related systems integration services.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P6_S2	A s a result, we focused virtually all of our research and development and marketing efforts, as well as a majority of our sales efforts, on DataV during 2016.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P6_S3	We intend to continue to run our legacy software resale and engineering services business for the foreseeable future.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P6_S4	We were incorporated in the State of Washington in July 1994.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P6_S5	Our principal office is located at 110 110th Avenue NE, Suite 300, Bellevue, Washington 98004, and our telephone number is (425) 519-5900.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P6_S6	The IoT market is still emerging, but we believe it will present a large market opportunity for us.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P6_S7	This market includes consumer, business, government and industrial segments, and encompasses software, hardware, connectivity and cloud providers as well as systems integrators.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P6_S8	While larger research firms do not yet widely track the IoT market, available research anticipates that over time, the deployment of hundreds of billions of connected devices may generate trillions of dollars of economic value.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P6_S9	The IoT marketplace is currently being influenced by the following factors:
1054721_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	Development of machine learning and data analytics software that advances the understanding of complex systems but lacks the capability to effectively process the proliferation of resulting data.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	The availability of inexpensive cloud compute and storage capabilities able to scale to the extent likely to be demanded by IoT.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	Software Software revenue for the last two fiscal years was as follows (in thousands):
1054721_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	DataV Software DataV is a comprehensive software solution developed by BSQUARE intended to address a variety of business use cases specific to industrial IoT applications.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P10_S1	DataV addresses the following business use cases:
1054721_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	Predictive Failure: By employing machine learning and advanced data analytics, DataV is able to predict, with varying levels of accuracy, future operational conditions for equipment or devices that are part of the overall IoT system.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	For many industrial concerns, the operational condition of greatest interest is a failure state.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P12_S1	By being able to predict failures before they occur, DataV customers are able to take steps to remediate the condition more quickly, less expensively and with less operational disruption.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	Adaptive Diagnostics: For equipment that has already failed, DataV can dynamically proscribe diagnostic and repair steps that have the highest probability of quickly and less expensively resolving the problem.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P13_S1	DataV uses historical repair data coupled with machine learning and data analytics to achieve this.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	IoT Device Management: The spread of data-generating devices in IoT systems introduces a new set of operational problems for industrial concerns.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P14_S1	DataV is able to facilitate IoT device management, including software and configuration updates, over large- scale populations of connected devices.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	Condition-Based Maintenance: DataV allows organizations to move beyond maintenance cycles based solely on time or usage, which inevitably result in over- or under-servicing of equipment.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P15_S1	DataV develops maintenance schedules based on actual equipment condition using not only device data but environmental data as well.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P15_S2	This results in lower overall service costs and improved asset longevity.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	Asset Optimization: Industrial concerns with large fleets of similar equipment want to ensure the performance of their equipment is maximized.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P16_S1	DataV, again by employing machine learning, data analytics, and historical data, can help these customers identify underperforming assets and proscribe remediation steps.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	Asset Utilization: DataV can assist our customers in tracking how their products are used in the field.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P17_S1	This can help ensure that equipment use is as intended, an important requirement for heavy equipment rental firms.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P17_S2	It can also provide product designers with feedback that can help improve product performance and differentiation.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	The DataV solution is designed to be implemented in a wide variety of industrial sectors and vertical markets, including commercial transportation, oil and gas extraction, manufacturing, water and power, medical devices and others.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P18_S1	These industrial sectors share common operational characteristics, such as the dependence on complex capital equipment where the cost of failure or sub-optimal performance is relatively high.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P18_S2	In other cases, our customers seek new revenue-generating products or services to enhance operating profitability.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P18_S3	We license our DataV software through various customer licensing models, including perpetual and subscription, and we are flexible in providing DataV on-premises, hosted or via a software as a service ( SaaS ) model.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P18_S4	We officially launched DataV as a commercially available product in March 2016.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P18_S5	Although we had previously engaged in several paid proof-of-concept tests with customers prior to that, we secured our first order in May 2016.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P18_S6	This order, valued at $4.3 million over a three-year period, allowed PACCAR, Inc., a heavy-duty truck manufacturer, to employ adaptive diagnostics in order to more rapidly service and repair trucks.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P18_S7	The order included a perpetual license to use DataV for that specific application on certain engines in North America, as well as annual maintenance and custom systems integration services.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P18_S8	In November 2016, we secured our second DataV order.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P18_S9	This order, placed by Itron, Inc., a large global manufacturer of electric, water, and gas meters for utilities as well as smart city solutions targeting IoT device management, is valued at $1.9 million for the first year with a $2.9 million four-year extension option.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P18_S10	The deal includes a subscription license to use DataV in addition to maintenance and systems integration services.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P18_S11	In December 2016, we secured an order from a global provider of candy and beverages.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P18_S12	This contract is for a smart vending initiative that adds intelligence to existing fleets of vending machines, allowing them to better track real-time sales data and, in the future, better predict equipment failures within these machines.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P18_S13	We have distribution agreements with multiple third-party software vendors.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P18_S14	Our ability to resell these third-party software products, whether stand-alone or in conjunction with our own proprietary software and engineering service offerings, provides our customers with a significant solution source for their project needs.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P18_S15	Our primary third-party software offerings include the following:
1054721_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	For 18 years, we have been a Microsoft authorized Value-Added Provider ( VAP ) of Windows Embedded operating systems and toolkits for the complete line of Windows Embedded products, including major product families such as Windows Embedded Compact, Windows Embedded Standard and Windows Embedded Server.

1054721_17_ITEM1_P19_S2	Of our total revenue, 72% in 2016 and 64% in 2015 resulted from the sale of Windows Embedded operating systems.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	We have been a Microsoft authorized VAP of Windows Mobile operating systems since November 2009.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P20_S1	Along with Windows Mobile operating systems, we also sell Microsoft s Office Mobile product.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P20_S2	We are currently authorized to sell Windows Mobile operating systems and related products in North America, South America, and Central America (excluding Cuba) (the Americas ), Japan, Taiwan, and the region comprised of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa ( EMEA ).
1054721_17_ITEM1_P20_S3	Of our total revenue in 2016, 9% was generated through the sale of Windows Mobile operating systems, compared to 12% in 2015.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	We are an authorized distributor for Adobe Flash technologies and Adobe Reader.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	We are an authorized distributor of Intel Corporation s Embedded Security product in North America.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	The sale of Microsoft operating systems has accounted for substantially all of our third-party software revenue historically, including 98% of third-party software revenue in 2016 and 97% of third-party software revenue in 2015.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P23_S1	Other Proprietary Software Products Apart from DataV, we offer the following proprietary software products:
1054721_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	HTML5 Rendering Engine Our HTML5 Rendering Engine is based on the open-source WebKit platform that is maintained by a number of leading internet and device companies.

1054721_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	By the end of 2016, we had effectively discontinued all research and development efforts on these products and no longer actively sell them.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	Professional Engineering Services Professional engineering service revenue for the last two fiscal years was as follows (in thousands):
1054721_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	DataV Services In order to operate efficiently, DataV software must be integrated with a variety of customer systems, devices and databases, requiring a significant services component.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P28_S1	We anticipate DataV contracts will frequently include a services component of 10-30 percent of total contract value.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P28_S2	Services offered in this context include the following:
1054721_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	Other Service Offerings Customers engage us for engineering services due to our extensive device software development and testing experience and because of our deep experience with embedded and mobile operating systems.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P29_S1	We believe that engaging us on a new device design typically results in shorter development cycles and reduced time-to-market, lower overall costs to complete projects, and enhanced product robustness and features, which a customer may otherwise have been unable to achieve.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P29_S2	We offer a variety of engineering services to our customers including:
1054721_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	Test automation engineering and consulting services.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	Service revenue derived from our engagement with Google was $5.2 million, or 34%, of 2016 service revenue, and $4.7 million, or 23%, of service revenue in 2015.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P31_S1	Service revenue derived from our engagement with The Coca-Cola Company was $3.4 million, or 23%, of 2016 service revenue, and $4.5 million, or 22%, of service revenue in 2015.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P31_S2	Our strategy is to invest in growing our DataV solution, while we continue to operate our third-party software and ongoing engineering services business as efficiently as possible and invest the cash generated by this business in our DataV solution.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P31_S3	Toward that end, in 2016 we:
1054721_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	Focused all research and development efforts on development of our DataV solution and related business applications.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P33_S0	Focused all marketing efforts on launching our DataV solution and building our IoT business solutions brand.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	Launched a customer solutions group in 2016, chartered with building enterprise-scale customer support, cloud hosting, and DataV services capabilities.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P34_S1	This group also includes our professional engineering services organization.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	Collectively, we intend for these steps to help us execute on a higher-margin proprietary software business enabled by related systems integration services, while reducing our dependency on our legacy lower-margin software and lower value added services business.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P35_S1	Relationship with Microsoft We have a long-standing relationship with Microsoft and this relationship is important to the continuing success of our business.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P35_S2	Our credentials as a Microsoft partner include:
1054721_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	Microsoft has engaged us on various engineering service engagements.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	We work closely with Microsoft executives, developers, product managers and sales personnel.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P37_S1	We leverage these relationships in a variety of ways, including:
1054721_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	We receive rebates from Microsoft based upon the achievement of predefined sales objectives.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P39_S0	See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for more information regarding our relationship with Microsoft.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P40_S0	Sales and Marketing We market our software solutions and engineering services utilizing a direct sales model.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P40_S1	We have sales personnel throughout the United States and in Taiwan, the United Kingdom and Japan.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P41_S0	Historically, we have not made significant use of resellers, channel partners, representative agents or other indirect channels.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P41_S1	Key elements of our sales and marketing strategy include direct marketing, content marketing, trade shows, event marketing, public relations, analyst relations, social media properties, customer and strategic alliance partner co-marketing programs and a comprehensive website.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P41_S2	Research and Development During 2016, substantially all of our research and development personnel were dedicated to the design, development and release of DataV, and we expect this to continue to be the case for the foreseeable future.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P41_S3	Members of our research and development staff work closely with our sales and marketing departments, as well as with our customers and potential customers, to better understand the IoT market needs and requirements.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P41_S4	We perform our research and development primarily utilizing engineering staff located in the United States.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P41_S5	Research and development expense was $2.86 million and $1.64 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P42_S0	Customers Targeted customers for DataV include large industrial concerns that either manufacture capital assets, such as a heavy-duty commercial truck manufacturer, or rely on the widespread deployment of capital assets in the operation of their businesses, such as a large for-hire fleet operator.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P42_S1	DataV customers may also include manufacturers incorporating DataV within their own offerings in order to add capabilities otherwise unavailable, such as an electric meter manufacturer developing smart grid technology for power utilities.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P42_S2	Customers purchasing third-party software and our other software solutions and engineering services include leading OEMs, ODMs, Enterprises, SVs and peripheral vendors.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P42_S3	Representative customers include Hewlett Packard, Google, Coca-Cola, Elo Touch Solutions, Honeywell International, Inc., IGT, Microsoft, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Panasonic, Oracle, Omnicell, Elektrobit and several industrial handset companies.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P43_S0	Competition The IoT market is still emerging.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P43_S1	Our competitors in this space include, or we anticipate could include, the following:
1054721_17_ITEM1_P44_S0	Cloud IoT providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and General Electric ( GE ) Predix.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P45_S0	Startups funded to enter the IoT market, including C3IoT and others.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P46_S0	Competition for our traditional third-party software and engineering solutions business includes:
1054721_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	Contract manufacturers, which have added or are adding software development capabilities to their offerings.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	Some of our competitors focus on only one aspect of our business or offer complementary products, which can be integrated with our products.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P48_S1	As we develop and bring to market new software products and service offerings, we may begin competing with companies with which we have not previously competed.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P48_S2	Further, as we expand the geographic markets into which we sell our software solutions and related services, or increase our penetration therein, we may expect to increasingly compete with companies with which we have not previously competed.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P48_S3	It is also possible that new competitors will enter the market or that our competitors will form alliances, including alliances with Microsoft, that may enable them to rapidly increase their market share.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P48_S4	Microsoft has not agreed to any exclusive arrangement with us, nor has it agreed not to compete with us.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P48_S5	Microsoft may decide to bring more of the core embedded development services and expertise that we provide in-house, possibly resulting in reduced software and service revenue opportunities for us.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	The barrier to entering the market as a provider of Microsoft-based smart connected systems software and services is low.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P49_S1	In addition, Microsoft has created marketing programs to encourage systems integrators to work on Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating system software and services.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P49_S2	These systems integrators are given substantially the same access by Microsoft to the Microsoft technology as we are.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P49_S3	New competitors may have lower overhead than we do and may be able to undercut our pricing.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P49_S4	We expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter the connected device market, and as new products and technologies are introduced.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P50_S0	Our international operations outside of North America consist principally of engineering services operations in Taipei, Taiwan and Trowbridge, England.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P50_S1	We have a sales and sales support office in Tokyo, Japan.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P50_S2	Because our OEM Distribution Agreement with Microsoft for the sale of Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems (e.g. Windows Embedded Compact) has been, until relatively recently, restricted to North America, including Mexico, the majority of our revenue continues to be generated from North America.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P50_S3	In 2016, revenue generated from customers located outside of North America was 5% of total revenue, compared to 8% in 2015.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P50_S4	The decrease in revenue from outside of North America in 2016 was due to lower third-party software and professional engineering services revenue in both Asia and EMEA.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P50_S5	See Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for more information regarding our international operations.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P51_S0	The following indicates our total headcount by area:
1054721_17_ITEM1_P52_S0	Of the total headcount of 172 at December 31, 2016, 114 were located in North America, 28 in Taiwan, 29 in the United Kingdom and one in Japan.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P53_S0	As conditions necessitate, engineering service employees perform research and development activities and vice versa.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P54_S0	In general, we strive to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and through contractual arrangements.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P54_S1	However, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be effective to prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, or to prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to, or competitive with, those developed by us.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P54_S2	Additionally, because a significant portion of our revenue relates to the sale of third-party software products, we also rely on our partners, particularly Microsoft, to appropriately protect their own intellectual property.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P55_S0	As of January 31, 2017, we had five pending United States ( US ) patent applications related to DataV, in addition to nine issued US patents related to other products and services.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P55_S1	We also have a number of registered trademarks in various jurisdictions.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P55_S2	We will continue to pursue appropriate protections for our intellectual property.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P55_S3	See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for more information regarding our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P56_S0	We electronically file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P56_S1	We make available on our website at www.bsquare.com, free of charge, copies of these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing such reports with, or furnishing them to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1054721_17_ITEM1_P56_S2	The following table sets forth certain information with respect to our directors and executive and other senior officers as of January 31, 2017:
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	As discussed under Item 1 of Part I, Business Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, our actual results could differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and the trading price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Microsoft-Related Risk Factors Because we provide software and services to customers building devices utilizing Microsoft s Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, as well as the fact that a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, Microsoft has a significant direct and indirect influence on our business.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P1_S3	The following Microsoft-related risk factors may negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P1_S4	If we do not maintain our OEM Distribution Agreements with Microsoft or if Microsoft de-emphasizes or divests itself from these areas of its business, our revenue would decrease and our business would be adversely affected.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We have OEM Distribution Agreements ( ODAs ) for Software Products for Embedded Systems with Microsoft, which enable us to sell various Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems to our customers in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean (excluding Cuba), Mexico, the E.U. and the European Free Trade Association.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	These ODAs are effective through June 30, 2017 and are typically renewed annually or bi-annually.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P2_S2	We have also entered into other ODAs with Microsoft pursuant to which we are licensed to sell Microsoft Windows Mobile operating systems to customers in North America, South America, Central America (excluding Cuba), Japan, Taiwan, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P2_S3	The ODAs to sell Windows Mobile operating systems are effective through June 30, 2017 and are typically renewed annually or bi-annually.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P2_S4	We generated $78.8 million and $80.4 million of revenue in 2016 and 2015, respectively, through our sales of Microsoft operating systems and expect this revenue stream to continue in 2017.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P2_S5	If either of the ODAs is terminated by Microsoft (which Microsoft can do unilaterally) or not renewed, or if Microsoft decides to no longer invest in or to divest itself from these areas of its business, our software revenue and resulting gross profit could decrease significantly and our operating results would be negatively impacted.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Future renewals, if any, could be on less favorable terms, which could also negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P2_S7	Microsoft can change pricing under the ODAs at any time, and unless we are able to pass through price increases to our customers, our revenue, gross profit and operating results would be negatively impacted.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P2_S8	Further, Microsoft currently offers a rebate program in conjunction with our ODA activities in which we earn money for achieving certain predefined objectives.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P2_S9	If Microsoft were to eliminate or negatively modify the rebate program, our gross profit and operating results would be negatively impacted.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P2_S10	We qualified for rebate credits from Microsoft of $1.2 million and $1.1 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, a portion of which is accounted for as a reduction in cost of sales and a portion as a reduction in marketing expense if and when qualified expenditures are made.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P2_S11	Our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted by changes Microsoft has implemented in its pricing of operating systems.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P2_S12	Microsoft has implemented significant pricing changes for its embedded products, including ending its design registration pricing discounts, terminating its OEM Volume Royalty Program ( OVRP ) and changing the aggregate volume price structure and product royalties for existing embedded Windows products effective January 1, 2016.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P2_S13	These changes have altered the competitive dynamics because the same pricing discounts are available to all distributors of these Microsoft products.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P2_S14	As a distributor of Microsoft products, this impacts both the sales prices we charge our customers and the cost of goods sold we incur for many of the Microsoft products we sell.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P2_S15	At this time, the amount and impact of these changes to our revenue and gross profit are not determinable; however, they may negatively impact our operating results in 2017 and beyond.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P2_S16	The sale of Microsoft operating systems represented approximately 81% and 75% of our total revenue and approximately 74% and 56% of our total gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Microsoft has audited our records under the ODAs in the past and will likely audit our records again in the future and any negative audit results could result in additional charges and/or the termination of the ODAs.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	There are provisions in the ODAs that require us to maintain certain internal records and processes for auditing and other reasons.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Non-compliance with these and other requirements could result in the termination of the ODAs.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Microsoft concluded audits of our records pertaining to the ODAs in 2009 and 2006, neither of which had material findings.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	It is possible that future audits could result in charges due to any material findings that are found.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The provisions also include terms that may make us contractually liable for payment of royalties to Microsoft in the event that certificates of authenticity are lost, damaged or stolen.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our business and results of operations would be adversely impacted if Microsoft decided to provide Windows Embedded or Windows Mobile operating systems free of charge to customers.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Microsoft offers certain consumer Windows phone and tablet-based operating systems to customers free of charge, subject to certain limitations.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	While we do not distribute these operating systems today under our ODAs with Microsoft, if Microsoft were to offer, free of charge, operating systems that we do distribute, our business and results of operations would be adversely impacted.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P7_S2	If the markets for Windows Embedded and/or Windows Mobile operating systems decline, our business and operating results may be materially harmed.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Because a significant portion of our revenue to date has been generated by software and services targeted at customers and devices running the various Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, if the markets for these systems or platforms decline, our business and operating results could be negatively impacted.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Market acceptance of Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems will depend on many factors, including:
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Microsoft s development and support of various Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile markets.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	In Motion Limited ( RIM and other proprietary operating systems.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The willingness of software developers to continue to develop and expand the applications running on Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	To the extent that software developers write applications for competing operating systems that are more attractive to users than those available on Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, this could cause potential customers to select competing operating systems.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	DataV-Related Risk Factors Our ability to maintain or grow our proprietary software revenue is contingent on the success of DataV, our proprietary business-focused Internet of Things (IoT) solution.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	If DataV fails to gain or maintain traction with potential customers, or if we are not otherwise successful in developing competitive, unique product and service offerings that keep pace with technological changes and needs, our business would be negatively impacted.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Proprietary software product revenue provides us with much higher gross profit margins than we typically receive from both our third-party software products and our engineering service offerings, and provides other advantages as well.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P11_S3	During 2015 and 2016, we invested significant resources in developing and marketing our DataV proprietary IoT solution, which includes software products, applications and services designed to render raw device data into meaningful and actionable data.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P11_S4	As a relatively new solution, DataV may gain customer traction more slowly than anticipated, and our revenue and profit potential is uncertain.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P11_S5	We expect to continue to make investments in the development and marketing of DataV, and this will increase our operating expenses.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	There can be no assurance that there will be sufficient revenue generated by sales of DataV, or that it will achieve customer adoption quickly, o r at all.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Its failure would materially and adversely impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P12_S2	The IoT is an emerging market, and there can be no assurance that the IoT market will evolve as we expect, or that we will be successful in capitalizing on opportunities in this market.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P12_S3	We are currently devoting significant effort and resources to develop and launch our DataV solution to customers within the IoT market.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	IoT is an emerging and evolving market with many potential industry participants and customers, as well as undefined market opportunities and risks.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	This market may not materialize as we anticipate, and our efforts to capitalize on these opportunities may not be successful in the near term, or at all.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	If the IoT market does not materialize as we anticipate, or if our products and services do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition, and operating results would be adversely affect, any of which would likely cause our stock price to decline.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The long sales cycle of our products and services makes our revenue susceptible to fluctuations.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Our sales cycle can run six to eighteen months because the expense and complexity of the software and service offerings we sell generally require a lengthy customer approval process and may be subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control, including:
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The timing of customers competitive evaluation processes.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	In addition, to successfully sell our software and engineering service offerings, we must frequently educate our potential customers about the full benefits of our software and services, which can require significant time and expense.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	This is particularly true given the early stage of the IoT market.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P16_S2	If our sales cycle further lengthens unexpectedly, it could adversely affect the timing of our revenue, which could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P16_S3	If our security measures or those of third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers, or other service partners are breached or unauthorized access is otherwise obtained to our customers data, our data or our information technology ( IT ) systems, our or our customers confidential information or personal information may be compromised or misappropriated, our products and services offerings may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our products and services, and we may incur significant legal and financial liability.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Our products and services involve the storage and transmission of customers proprietary data and information, and security breaches could result in a risk of loss of this data or information, litigation and possible liability.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P16_S5	While we have security measures in place, they may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our IT systems, our customers data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P16_S6	Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers data, our data or our IT systems.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P16_S7	Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P16_S8	In addition, our customers may authorize third-party technology providers to access their customer data, and some of our customers may not have adequate security measures in place to protect their data.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P16_S9	Because we do not control our customers or third-party technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P16_S10	Malicious third parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our products and services.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P16_S11	Any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to legal liability.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P16_S12	Interruptions or delays in services from third-party data center hosting facilities or cloud computing platform providers could impair the delivery and availability of our products and services and harm our business.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We currently serve our software as a service ( SaaS ) customers from third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in the United States and other countries.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Any damage to, or failure of, these systems generally could result in interruptions in the availability of our products and services.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	continue to experience, such interruptions, which could cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions, and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to at tract new customers, all of which would reduce our revenue.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Our business would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our product and services offerings are unreliable.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P18_S3	They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct, as well as local administrative actions, changes to legal or permitting requirements and litigation to stop, limit or delay operation.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Privacy concerns and laws, evolving regulation of cloud computing, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our products and services and adversely affect our business.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Regulation related to the provision of services on the internet is increasing, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage and use of personal information.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P18_S7	In some cases, foreign data privacy laws and regulations, such as the E.U. s Data Protection Directive, and the country-specific laws and regulations that implement that directive, also govern the processing of personal information.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P18_S8	Further, laws are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes, such as the E.U. s e-Privacy Directive, and the country-specific regulations that implement that directive.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P18_S9	Such laws and regulations are subject to new and differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P18_S10	These and other requirements could reduce demand for our products and services or restrict our ability to store and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability to offer our products and services in certain locations or our customers' ability to deploy our solutions globally.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P18_S11	For example, in October 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework that had been in place since 2000, which allowed companies to meet certain European legal requirements for the transfer of personal data from the European Economic Area to the United States.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P18_S12	While other adequate legal mechanisms to lawfully transfer such data remain, the invalidation of the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework may result in different European data protection regulators applying differing standards for the transfer of personal data, which could result in increased regulation, cost of compliance and limitations on data transfer.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P18_S13	The costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our products and services, reduce overall demand for our products and services, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, any of which could harm our business.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P18_S14	Furthermore, concerns regarding data privacy may cause our customers customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our products and services effectively.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P18_S15	Even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products and services, and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P18_S16	We rely on third-party software and cloud platforms that could cause errors in, or failures of, our products and services and may be difficult to replace.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P18_S17	We rely on software licensed from, and cloud platforms provided by, third parties in order to offer our products and services.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P18_S18	Any errors or defects in third-party software or cloud platforms could result in errors in, or a failure of, our products and services, which could harm our business.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P18_S19	In addition, despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for third-party software or cloud platforms, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations for applications we did not develop or sell, all of which could harm our business.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P18_S20	Further, particular third-party software and cloud platforms may not continue to be available at reasonable prices, on commercially reasonable terms, or may become unavailable.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P18_S21	Any of these outcomes could significantly increase our expenses and result in delays in the provisioning of our products and services until equivalent technology is developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our products and services.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	General Business-Related Risk Factors Our marketplace is extremely competitive, which may result in price reductions, lower gross profit margins and loss of market share.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The IoT market is still emerging but already becoming increasingly competitive.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Our competitors in this space include, or we anticipate could include, the following:
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Cloud IoT providers such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, and GE Predix.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Startups funded to enter the IoT market, including C3IoT and others.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The market for device software and services is extremely competitive.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	We face competition from the following:
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Mobile and embedded test automation providers including Perfecto Mobile, mVerify, JAMO Solutions, SmartBear Software (AutomatedQA), TestPlant (eggPlant) and Keynote.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating system distributors such as Arrow Electronics, Inc.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We will encounter increasing competition in the growing IoT market from a number of additional software and service providers as we expand our focus on this market in 2016 and beyond.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Some of our competitors focus on only one aspect of our business or offer complementary products that can be integrated with our products.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	As we develop and bring to market new software products and service offerings, we may begin competing with companies with which we have not previously competed.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Further, as we expand the geographic markets into which we sell our software solutions and related services, or increase our penetration therein, we may expect to increasingly compete with companies with which we have not previously competed.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P27_S3	It is also possible that new competitors will enter the market or that our competitors will form alliances, including alliances with Microsoft, that may enable them to rapidly increase their market share.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P27_S4	Microsoft has not agreed to any exclusive arrangement with us, nor has it agreed not to compete with us.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P27_S5	Microsoft may decide to bring more of the core embedded development services and expertise that we provide in-house, possibly resulting in reduced software and service revenue opportunities for us.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The barrier to entering the market as a provider of Microsoft-based smart connected system software and services is low.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	In addition, Microsoft has created marketing programs to encourage systems integrators to work on Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating system software and services.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P28_S2	These systems integrators are given substantially the same access by Microsoft to the Microsoft technology as we are.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P28_S3	New competitors may have lower overhead than we do and may be able to undercut our pricing.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P28_S4	We expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter the connected device market, and as new products and technologies are introduced.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Management turnover creates uncertainties and could harm our business.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P28_S6	We have had significant changes in executive leadership in the past and more could occur.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P28_S7	Changes to strategic or operating goals, which can often occur with the appointment of new executives, can create uncertainty, may negatively impact our ability to execute quickly and effectively, and may ultimately be unsuccessful.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P28_S8	In addition, executive leadership transition periods are often difficult as the new executives gain detailed knowledge of our operations, and friction can result from changes in strategy and management style.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Until we integrate new personnel, and unless they are able to succeed in their po sitions, we may be unable to successfully manage and grow our business, and our financial condition and profitability may suffer.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Further, to the extent we experience additional management turnover, competition for top management is high and it may take months to find a candidate that meets our requirements.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P29_S2	If we are unable to attract and retain qualified management personnel, our business could suffer.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P29_S3	We depend on our direct sales force to achieve planned revenue growth in the future, and if our sales force is not successful, our financial condition will be harmed.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P29_S4	We sell our solutions primarily through our direct sales force.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P29_S5	Our ability to achieve planned revenue growth in the future will depend upon the success of our direct sales force and our ability to adapt our sales efforts to address the evolving markets for our solutions.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P29_S6	If our direct sales force does not perform as expected, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be adversely affected.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P29_S7	Our operating results may be adversely affected by changing economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P29_S8	Uncertain economic and political conditions worldwide have from time-to-time contributed, and may continue to contribute, to slowdowns in the technology industries at large, particularly in an emerging market such as IoT, potentially resulting in: reduced demand for our products and services as a result of constraints on IT-related capital spending by our customers; purchasing delays; payment delays adversely affecting our cash flow and revenue; and difficulty in accurate budgeting and planning.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in key markets, remain uncertain or deteriorate, we may experience material impacts on our business, operating results and financial condition.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Our business and operations would be adversely impacted in the event of a failure or interruption of our IT infrastructure.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P30_S2	The proper functioning of our own IT infrastructure is critical to the efficient operation and management of our business.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Our IT is vulnerable to cyber-attacks, computer viruses, worms and other malicious software programs, physical and electronic break-ins, sabotage and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P30_S4	We believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology infrastructure and our operations from these IT-related and other potential disruptions.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P30_S5	However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P30_S6	We may be subject to product liability claims that could result in significant costs.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P30_S7	Our software license and service agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P30_S8	It is possible, however, that these provisions may be ineffective under the laws of certain jurisdictions or that our customers may not agree to these limitations.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P30_S9	Although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date, as our business focus continues to transition to the sale of our own proprietary products, the sale and support of our products and services may be subject to such claims in the future.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P30_S10	There is a risk that any such claims or liabilities may exceed, or fall outside, the scope of our insurance coverage, and we may be unable to retain adequate liability insurance in the future.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P30_S11	A product liability claim brought against us, whether successful or not, could negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P30_S12	Our business and results of operations would be adversely impacted in the event that we incur business losses that are not covered by or exceed our existing business insurance coverage.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P30_S13	We are insured against certain business risks and liabilities under our corporate insurance policies.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P30_S14	However, to the extent that we incur losses in connection with our business that are not covered by our existing insurance policies or that exceed our existing policy coverage, our business and results of operations would be adversely impacted.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Negative business conditions, changes in useful li ves, and other factors may negatively affect the carrying value of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	In the third quarter of 2011, we acquired MPC Data, Ltd. (renamed BSQUARE EMEA, Ltd.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	In 2015) including certain intangible assets with a carrying value of $463,000 and goodwill of $3.7 million as of December 31, 2016.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We evaluate goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Reductions in operating cash flows or projected cash flows of our reporting units could result in an impairment charge that would negatively impact our operating results.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Further, business conditions and other factors may also require us to reassess the useful lives associated with intangible assets.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Past acquisitions have proven difficult to integrate, and recent or future acquisitions, if any, could disrupt our business, dilute shareholder value and negatively affect our operating results.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We have acquired the technologies, assets and/or operations of other companies in the past and may acquire or make investments in companies, products, services and technologies in the future as part of our growth strategy.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	If we fail to properly evaluate, integrate and execute on our acquisitions and investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P34_S2	To successfully complete an acquisition, we must properly evaluate the technology, market and management team, accurately forecast the financial impact of the transaction, including accounting charges and transaction expenses, integrate and retain personnel, combine potentially different corporate cultures and effectively integrate products, research and development, sales, marketing and support operations.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P34_S3	If we fail to do any of these, we may suffer losses and impair relationships with our employees, customers and strategic partners.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Additionally, management may be distracted from day-to-day operations.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P34_S5	We also may be unable to maintain consistently uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, and significant demands may be placed on our management and our operations, information services and financial, legal and marketing resources.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P34_S6	Finally, acquired businesses sometimes result in unexpected liabilities and contingencies, which may involve compliance with foreign laws, payment of taxes, labor negotiations or other unknown costs and expenses, which could be significant.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P34_S7	We may not be able to raise additional capital if required to support our business, and the issuance of additional equity or convertible debt securities would result in the dilution of our existing shareholders.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P34_S8	If we need to raise additional operating capital, we may find that our access to equity and debt capital markets is limited or blocked entirely.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P34_S9	In the past, our stock has traded at low volumes and overall investor confidence in the stock market could falter.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P34_S10	This could make it difficult or impossible to sell additional shares on the public markets.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P34_S11	In addition, it may be difficult and costly to obtain debt financing and we may be unable to borrow additional funds at acceptable cost, or at all, should the need arise.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P34_S12	If we are unable to raise capital as necessary, it may adversely affect our ability to invest in products or fund operations, which would materially harm our business and negatively affect operating results.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P34_S13	Further, even though we may not need additional funds, we may still elect to do so for other reasons.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P34_S14	If we decide to raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership percentages of our existing shareholders would be reduced.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P34_S15	Our common stock has experienced and may continue to experience price and volume fluctuations, which could lead to costly litigation for us and make an investment in us less appealing.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Stock markets are subject to significant price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies and the market price of our common stock may therefore frequently change as a result.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P35_S1	In addition, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate substantially due to a variety of other factors, including quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations (including as a result of fluctuations in our revenue recognition), announcements about technological innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors, market acceptance of new products and services offered by us, developments in the IoT market, changes in our relationships with our suppliers or customers, our ability to meet analysts expectations, changes in the information technology environment, changes in earnings estimates by analysts, sales of our common stock by existing holders and the loss of key personnel.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s stock, class action securities litigation has often been instituted against such companies.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management s attention and resources, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Taxing jurisdictions in the United States are becoming more aggressive with tax legislation and tax collection, particularly states facing significant budget deficits, which could expose us to additional tax liability that we have not been subject to in the past.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P37_S1	We make sales in many jurisdictions across the United States, most of which we do not have nexus in and, therefore, are not subject to sales, franchise, income and other state and local taxes.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	have become more aggressive in defining nexus, among other things, which could result in us achievi ng nexus, or potentially achieving nexus in significantly more tax jurisdictions.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P38_S1	If this occurs and unless we are able to pass through this cost to our customers, our tax expense will increase which will negatively affect our results of operations.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Furthe r, because state and local tax laws are becoming increasingly complex, our cost to monitor our state and local tax compliance will increase which will negatively affect our results of operations.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Additionally, there can be no assurance that we do not curre ntly have unknown tax exposure in a state or local tax jurisdiction because of recent tax law changes which we are unaware of and the resulting liability could be significant and would negatively affect our results of operations.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	There may be restrictions on the use of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards due to a tax law ownership change.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code restricts the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P40_S1	At December 31, 2016, we had approximately $55.7 million of federal and $1.8 million of state net operating loss carryforwards and $2.8 million of tax credit carryforwards.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Of the federal net operating loss carryforwards, an aggregate of $36.3 million will expire in 2022 and 2023.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Under the applicable tax rules, an ownership change occurs if greater than five percent shareholders of an issuer s outstanding common stock collectively increase their ownership percentage by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P41_S1	We have performed analyses of possible ownership changes which included consideration of a third-party study, and do not believe that an ownership change as defined by Section 382 has occurred.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P41_S2	However, if a tax law ownership change has occurred of which we are not aware, or if a tax law ownership change occurs in the future, we may have to adjust the valuation of our deferred tax assets, and could be at risk of having to pay income taxes notwithstanding the existence of our sizable carryforwards.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Further, to the extent that we have utilized our carryforwards from prior years, the existence of a previous tax law ownership change that we did not account for could result in liability for back taxes, interest, and penalties.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P41_S4	If we are unable to utilize our carryforwards and/or if we previously utilized carryforwards to which we were not entitled, it would negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P41_S5	Intellectual Property-Related Risk Factors Our software and service offerings could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which could expose us to additional costs and litigation and could adversely affect our ability to sell our products and services or cause shipment delays or stoppages.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P41_S6	It is difficult to determine whether our software products, including DataV, and engineering services infringe third-party intellectual property rights, particularly in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which technologies often overlap and where there may be numerous patent applications pending, many of which are confidential when filed.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P41_S7	If we were to discover that one of our software products or service offerings, or a product based on one of our reference designs, violated a third-party s proprietary rights, we may not be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, to continue offering that product or service.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P41_S8	Similarly, third parties may claim that our current or future software products and services infringe their proprietary rights, regardless of whether such claims have merit.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P41_S9	Any such claims could increase our costs and negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	In certain cases, we have been unable to obtain indemnification against claims that third-party technology incorporated into our software products and services infringe the proprietary rights of others.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P42_S1	However, any indemnification we do obtain may be limited in scope or amount.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Even if we receive broad third-party indemnification, these entities may not have the financial capability to indemnify us in the event of infringement.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P42_S3	In addition, in some circumstances we are required to indemnify our customers for claims made against them that are based on our software products or services.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P42_S4	There can be no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims related to the software products and services we provide, or arising from the incorporation by us of third-party technology, and claims for indemnification from our customers resulting from such claims, will not be asserted or prosecuted against us.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P42_S5	Some of our competitors have, or are affiliated, with companies with substantially greater resources than we have, and these competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than we could.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P42_S6	In addition, we expect that software developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the software industry grows, and as the functionality of products in different industry segments increasingly overlap.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P42_S7	Such claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources in addition to potential product redevelopment costs and delays.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P42_S8	Furthermore, if we were unsuccessful in resolving a patent or other intellectual property infringement action claim against us, we may be prohibited from developing or commercializing certain of our technologies and products, or delivering services based on the infringing technology, unless we obtain a license from the holder of the patent or other intellectual property rights.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P42_S9	There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain any such license on commercially favorable terms, or at all.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P42_S10	If such license were not obtained, we would be required to cease these related business operations, which could negatively impact our business, revenue and operating results.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual pro perty rights, competitors may be able to use our technology or trademarks, which could weaken our competitive position, reduce our revenue and increase our costs.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P43_S1	If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, our competitive position could be weakened and our revenue and operating results adversely affected.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P43_S2	We rely primarily on confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions as well as a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, to protect our intellectual property.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P43_S3	These laws and procedures provide only limited protection.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P43_S4	It is possible that another party could obtain patents that block our use of some, or all, of our software products, including DataV, and services.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P43_S5	If that occurred, we would need to obtain a license from the patent holder or design around those patents.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P43_S6	The patent holder may or may not choose to make a license available to us at all, or on acceptable terms.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P43_S7	Similarly, it may not be possible to design around a blocking patent.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P43_S8	In general, there can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws will be effective to prevent misappropriation of our technology, or to prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to or competitive with those developed by us.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We frequently license the source code of our software products and the source code results of our services to customers.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P44_S1	There can be no assurance that customers with access to our source code will comply with the license terms or that we will discover any violations of the license terms or, in the event of discovery of violations, that we will be able to successfully enforce the license terms and/or recover the economic value lost from such violations.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	To license some of our software products, we rely in part on shrink-wrap and click wrap licenses that are not signed by the end user and, therefore, may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P45_S1	As with other software, our software products are susceptible to unauthorized copying and uses that may go undetected, and policing such unauthorized use is difficult.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	A significant portion of our marks include the word BSQUARE.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Other companies use forms of BSQUARE in their marks alone, or in combination with other words, and we cannot prevent all such third-party uses.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We license certain trademark rights to third parties.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Such licensees may not abide by our compliance and quality control guidelines with respect to such trademark rights.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Any of these outcomes could negatively impact our brand, dilute its recognition in the marketplace, or confuse potential customers, all of which could harm our business.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The computer software market is characterized by frequent and substantial intellectual property litigation, which is often complex and expensive, and involves a significant diversion of resources and uncertainty of outcome.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property or to defend against a claim of infringement or invalidity.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Litigation could result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources and could negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P48_S3	Our software or hardware products or the third-party hardware or software integrated with our products or delivered as part of our service offerings may suffer from defects or errors that could impair our ability to sell our products and services.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P48_S4	Software and hardware components as complex as those needed for dedicated purpose intelligent systems frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P48_S5	We have had to delay commercial release of certain versions of our products until problems were corrected and, in some cases, have provided product enhancements to correct errors in released products.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P48_S6	Some of our contracts require us to repair or replace products that fail to work.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P48_S7	To the extent that we repair or replace products, our expenses may increase.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P48_S8	In addition, it is possible that by the time defects are fixed, the market opportunity may decline which may result in lost revenue.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P48_S9	Moreover, to the extent that we provide increasingly comprehensive products and services, particularly those focused on IoT hardware, and rely on third-party manufacturers and suppliers to manufacture these products, we will be dependent on the ability of third-party manufacturers to correct, identify and prevent manufacturing errors.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P48_S10	Errors that are discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance, diversion of development resources, damage to our reputation and increased service and warranty costs, all of which could negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P48_S11	If we are unable to license key software from third parties, our business could be harmed.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P48_S12	We sometimes integrate third-party software with our proprietary software and engineering service offerings or sell such third-party software offerings on a standalone basis (e.g. Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems under our ODAs with Microsoft).
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P48_S13	If our relationships with these third-party software vendors were to deteriorate, or be eliminated in their entirety, we might be unable to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P48_S14	In the event that we are unable to obtain these third-party software offerings, we would be required to develop this technology internally, assuming it was economically or technically feasible, or seek similar software offerings from other third parties assuming there were competing offerings in the marketplace, which could delay or limit our ability to introduce enhancements or new products, or to continue to sell existing products and engineering services, thereby negatively impacting our revenue and operating results.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Governance-Related Risk Factors It might be difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation, bylaws and Washington law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in the control of us or a change in our management, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Our Board of Directors has the authority under our amended and restated articles of incorporation to issue preferred stock with rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P49_S3	As a result, preferred stock could be issued quickly and easily with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make removal of our management more difficult.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P49_S4	In addition, our Board of Directors is divided into three classes.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P49_S5	The directors in each class serve for three-year terms, one class being elected each year by our shareholders.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P49_S6	This system of electing and removing directors may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company because it generally makes it more difficult for shareholders to replace a majority of our directors.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P49_S7	In addition, Chapter 19 of the Washington Business Corporation Act generally prohibits a target corporation from engaging in certain significant business transactions with a defined acquiring person for a period of five years after the acquisition, unless the transaction or acquisition of shares is approved by a majority of the members of the target corporation s Board of Directors prior to the time of acquisition.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P49_S8	This provision may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of our company.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P49_S9	The existence of these anti-takeover provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	International Operations-Related Risk Factors Our international operations expose us to greater intellectual property, management, collections, regulatory and other risks.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Customers outside of North America generated 5% of our total revenue in 2016 and 8% in 2015.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P50_S2	We currently have sizable operations outside of North America in Taiwan and the United Kingdom ( U.K. ) and also have a small sales and support presence in Japan.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Our international activities and operations expose us to a number of risks, including the following:
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Complex and/or adverse tax laws and/or changes thereto.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	The inherent risks of working in a certain highly regulated and/or controlled economies where relationships between company management and government officials is critical to timely processing of approvals required to conduct business.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P53_S0	In addition, on June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the E.U., commonly referred to as Brexit .
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Because of the referendum, it is expected that the British government will begin negotiating the terms of the U.K. s future relationship with the E.U.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Although it is unknown what those terms will be, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the U.K. and E.U. countries and increased regulatory complexities, which could adversely impact our operations in both the U.K. and the E.U.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P54_S0	These risks could have a material adverse effect on the financial and managerial resources required to operate our foreign offices, as well as on our future international revenue, which could negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P55_S0	As our customers seek more cost-effective locations to develop and manufacture their products, particularly overseas locations, our ability to continue to sell these customers our software products and services could be limited, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Due to competitive and other pressures, some of our customers have moved, and others may seek to move, the development and manufacturing of their smart, connected systems to overseas locations, which may limit our ability to sell these customers our software and services.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P55_S2	As an example, under our ODAs with Microsoft, we are currently only able to sell Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems to our customers in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean (excluding Cuba), Mexico, the E.U. and the European Free Trade Association.
1054721_17_ITEM1A_P55_S3	If our customers, or potential customers, move their manufacturing overseas we may be less competitive, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	As of December 31, 2016, our corporate headquarters are located in 24,061 square feet of leased space in a single location in Bellevue, Washington.
1054721_17_ITEM2_P0_S1	The lease term ends in May 2020.
1054721_17_ITEM2_P0_S2	In North America, we also lease office space in San Diego, California; Boston, Massachusetts; and Akron, Ohio.
1054721_17_ITEM2_P0_S3	We lease office space overseas in Tokyo, Japan; Taipei, Taiwan; and Trowbridge, United Kingdom.
1054721_17_ITEM2_P0_S4	Our facilities have sufficient capacity to support our current operational needs as well as short-term growth plans.
1054721_17_ITEM5_P0_S0	Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.
1054721_17_ITEM5_P1_S0	Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol BSQR.
1054721_17_ITEM5_P1_S1	The following table sets forth the high and low closing prices for our common stock for the periods indicated, as reported by the NASDAQ Global Market.
1054721_17_ITEM5_P2_S0	Holders As of January 31, 2017, there were 116 holders of record of our common stock.
1054721_17_ITEM5_P2_S1	Because many shares of our common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of shareholders, we are unable to determine the total number of shareholders represented by these holders of record.
1054721_17_ITEM5_P2_S2	Dividends We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock.
1054721_17_ITEM5_P2_S3	We currently intend to retain any future earnings to fund future development and growth and, therefore, do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1054721_17_ITEM5_P3_S0	Our line of credit agreement contains limitations on our ability to pay distributions or dividends while there is an ongoing event of default or to the extent such distribution causes an event of default.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations may contain some statements and information that are not historical facts but are forward-looking statements.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P1_S2	Business Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, and Item 1A of Part I, Risk Factors.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	Overview Since our inception, our business has largely been focused on providing software solutions (historically including reselling software from Microsoft Corporation ( Microsoft )) and related engineering services to businesses that develop, market and sell dedicated purpose standalone intelligent systems.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P2_S1	Examples of dedicated purpose standalone intelligent systems include smart, connected computing devices such as smart phones, set-top boxes, point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, tablets and handheld data collection devices, as well as smart vending machines, ATM machines, digital signs and in-vehicle telematics and entertainment devices.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	We focus on systems that utilize various Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems as well as devices running other popular operating systems such as Android, Linux, and QNX, and that are usually connected to a network or data cloud via a wired or wireless connection.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	Our customers include world-class original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ), original design manufacturers ( ODMs ), corporate enterprises ( Enterprises ), silicon vendors ( SVs ) and peripheral vendors.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P3_S2	A significant portion of our business historically has also been focused on reselling software from Microsoft, from which a majority of our revenue currently continues to be derived.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	Beginning in early 2014, we initiated development efforts focused on new proprietary software products addressing the Internet of Things ( IoT ) market, which is the interconnection of uniquely identifiable embedded computing devices within the existing internet infrastructure.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	While IoT is a relatively new market, we believe the work we have engaged in since our inception namely adding intelligence and connectivity to discrete standalone devices and systems embodies much of what is central to the core functionality of IoT. These software development efforts have driven a new business initiative for BSQUARE, which we refer to as DataV .
1054721_17_ITEM7_P4_S2	Our DataV solution includes software products, applications and services that are designed to render raw IoT device data into meaningful and actionable data for our customers.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P4_S3	We launched DataV late in the first quarter of 2016 and announced our first three major customer bookings later that year.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P4_S4	These bookings comprised software licensing, software maintenance and related systems integration services and are, we believe, indicative of the potential customer demand for DataV.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	We believe that DataV presents high growth opportunities in a large, expanding addressable market, at substantially higher gross margins as compared to our traditional business.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	Over time, we intend for DataV to become our primary focus, representing a transition away from dependence on resale software and engineering services toward increased reliance on our own proprietary software and related systems integration services.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P5_S2	As a result, we focused virtually all of our research and development and marketing efforts, as well as a majority of our sales efforts, on DataV during 2016.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P5_S3	We intend to continue to run our legacy software resale and engineering services business for the foreseeable future.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	Critical Accounting Judgments Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from the sale of software and professional engineering services when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the selling price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	We generally use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement, and shipping documents and time records to verify delivery.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P6_S2	We assess whether the selling price is fixed or determinable based on the contract and/or customer purchase order and payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P6_S3	We assess collectability based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer s payment history.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P6_S4	Periodically, we will begin work on engineering service engagements prior to having a signed contract and, in some cases, the contract is signed in a quarter after which service delivery costs are incurred.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P6_S5	We do not defer costs associated with such engagements before we have received a signed contract.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P6_S6	We recognize software revenue upon delivery provided that no significant obligations remain on our part, substantive acceptance conditions, if any, have been met and other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P6_S7	We recognize service revenue from time and materials contracts, and training service agreements, as we perform the services.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	certain time and materials service agreements with capped fee structures, are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method assuming we can make reasonable estimates of completion.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	We use the percentage-of-completion method of accounting because we believe it is the most accurate method to recognize revenue based on the nature and scope of these engineering service contracts and provides the best match of revenue recognized with costs incurred.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P7_S2	We measure the percentage of completion based primarily on input measures such as hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as co ntract milestones, when applicable.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P7_S3	We use significant judgment when estimating total hours and progress to completion on these arrangements, which we use to determine the amount of revenue we recognize as well as whether a loss is recognized, if one is ex pected to be incurred for the remainder of the project.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P7_S4	We incorporate revisions to hour and cost estimates when the causal facts become known.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P7_S5	In certain cases, we are unable to make reliable estimates of either specific amounts or ranges of contract revenues and costs.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P7_S6	In such cases where we anticipate that we will not incur a loss on the contract, we use a zero profit model, recognizing equal amounts of revenue and cost during the contract period and delaying profit recognition until the project is completed and accepted.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	We also enter into arrangements in which a customer purchases a combination of software licenses, engineering services and post-contract customer support and/or maintenance ( PCS ).
1054721_17_ITEM7_P8_S1	As a result, judgment is often required to determine the appropriate accounting, including how to allocate the price among the deliverable elements if there are multiple elements.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	PCS may include rights to upgrades, when and if available, telephone support, updates and enhancements.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	We allocate revenue to each element based on the relative fair value of each of the elements in a multiple element arrangement, when vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) of fair value exists for all elements.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	When the same element is sold separately, VSOE is established; when VSOE does not exist, judgments are required to assess the fair values of various elements of an agreement, which can impact the recognition of revenue in each period.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P10_S2	While changes in the allocation of the sales price between contract elements may affect the timing of revenue recognition, the total revenue recognized on the contract would not change.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	When elements such as software and engineering services are contained in a single arrangement, or in related arrangements with the same customer, we allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value if such element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	In the absence of fair value for a delivered element, we allocate revenue first to the fair value of the undelivered elements and then to the residual delivered elements.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P11_S2	In the absence of fair value for an undelivered element, we account for the arrangement as a single unit of accounting, which delays revenue recognition until all elements are fulfilled.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P11_S3	There are two items involving revenue recognition that require us to make more difficult and subjective judgments: the determination of VSOE of fair value in multiple element arrangements and the estimation of percentage of completion on fixed-price service contracts.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	While we have entered into very few multiple-element arrangements for proprietary software historically, our initial DataV contracts each included multiple elements, including software licenses, installation, training services and PCS, and we anticipate this will continue to be the case for many future DataV contracts.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	We have been unable to establish VSOE for DataV contracts to date.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P12_S2	We measure our estimate of completion on fixed-price contracts, which in turn determines the amount of revenue we recognize, based primarily on actual hours incurred to date and our estimate of remaining hours necessary to complete the contract.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P12_S3	These estimates factor in such variables as the remaining tasks, the complexity of the tasks, the contracted quality of the software to be provided, the customer s estimated delivery date, integration of third-party software and quality thereof and other factors.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	Every fixed-price contract requires various approvals within our company, including our Chief Executive Officer if significant.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	This approval process takes into consideration a number of factors, including the complexity of engineering.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	Historically, our estimation processes related to fixed-price contracts have been accurate based on the information known at the time of the reporting of our results.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	However, percentage-of-completion estimates require significant judgment.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	As of December 31, 2016, we were delivering professional engineering services under one fixed-price service contract.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	The percentage of completion calculations on this contract represents management s best estimates based on the facts and circumstances as of the filing of this report.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P15_S2	If there are changes to the underlying facts and circumstances, we record the revisions to the percentage-of-completion calculations in the period the changes are noted.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P15_S3	For illustrative purposes only, if we were 10% under in our estimate of completion on the fixed-bid contract active on December 31, 2016, our revenue could have been over-stated by approximately $35,000 for 2016.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	We evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	Our intangible assets consist of customer relationships arising from business acquisitions.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P17_S1	We periodically assess the value of our intangible assets; factors that could trigger an impairment analysis include significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	value of the intangible asset may be impaired, we assess the likelihoo d of recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	If this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining useful life, we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P18_S2	Any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	The first step in the impairment analy sis compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P19_S1	If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, we then perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of any impairment loss.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P19_S2	We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P19_S3	We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P19_S4	If we determine that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely greater than its carrying amount, we do not conduct further impairment testing.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	If we determine that the fair value of the reporting unit is not more likely greater than the carrying amount, we perform a quantitative two-step impairment test.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	Our stock-based compensation expense for stock options is estimated at the grant date based on the stock award s fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton ( BSM ) option-pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	The BSM model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and option life.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P21_S2	If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	Restricted stock units ( RSUs ) and restricted stock awards ( RSAs ) are measured based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant as determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience and expected future activity.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P23_S1	To the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimates, stock-based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	Incentive Compensation We make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions regarding the likelihood of attainment, and the level thereof, of bonuses payable under our annual incentive compensation programs.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	We accrue bonuses and recognize the resulting expense when the bonus is judged reasonably likely to be earned as of year-end and is estimable.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P24_S2	The amount accrued, and expense recognized, is the estimated portion of the bonus earned on a year-to-date basis less any amounts previously accrued.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P24_S3	These estimates, judgments and assumptions are made quarterly based on available information and take into consideration our year-to-date actual results, and expected results for the remainder of the year.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	Because we consider estimated future results in assessing the likelihood of attainment, significant judgment is required.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	If actual results differ materially from our estimates, the amount of bonus expense recorded in a particular quarter could be significantly over or under estimated.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the countries and other jurisdictions in which we operate.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	This process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P26_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P26_S3	Net operating losses and tax credits, to the extent not already utilized to offset taxable income or income taxes, also give rise to deferred tax assets.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P26_S4	We must then assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income, and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	We are required to use judgment as to the appropriate weighting of all available evidence when assessing the need for the establishment or the release of valuation allowances.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	As part of this analysis, we examine all available evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis and weigh the positive and negative information when determining the need for full or partial valuation allowances.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P27_S2	The evidence considered for each jurisdiction includes, among other items, (i) the historical levels of income or loss over a range of time periods that extends beyond the two years presented, (ii) the historical sources of income and losses, (iii) the expectations and risk associated with underlying estimates of future taxable income, (iv) the expectations and risk associated with new product offerings and uncertainties with the timing of future taxable income, and (v) prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	We estimate the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	Our sales may be subject to other taxes, particularly withholding taxes, due to our sales to customers in countries other than the United States.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	The tax regulations governing withholding taxes are complex, causing us to have to make assu mptions about the appropriate tax treatment.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P30_S2	Further, we make sales in many jurisdictions across the United States, where tax regulations are varied and complex.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P30_S3	We must therefore continue to analyze our state tax exposure and determine what the appropriat e tax treatments are, and make estimates for sales, franchise, income and other state taxes.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	The following table presents certain financial data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	Our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 Revenue We generate revenue from the sale of software, both our own proprietary software and third-party software that we resell, and the sale of engineering services.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	Total revenue decreased $9.2 million, or 9%, to $97.4 million in 2016 from $106.6 million in 2015.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P33_S2	This decrease was primarily due to lower sales of Windows Mobile and Embedded operating systems, a decrease in engineering services revenue, as well as decreases in our proprietary software revenue.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P33_S3	One customer, Honeywell International Inc., accounted for 14% of total revenue in 2016 and 16% of total revenue in 2015.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P33_S4	No other customers accounted for 10% or more of total revenue in either 2016 or 2015.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P33_S5	Revenue from our customers outside of North America decreased $3.6 million, or 41%, to $5.1 million in 2016, from $8.7 million in 2015.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P33_S6	Revenue from our customers outside of North America represented 5% of our total revenue in 2016, compared to 8% in 2015.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P33_S7	The decrease in revenue from outside of North America in 2016 was primarily attributable to lower sales of third-party software systems and lower professional engineering services revenue in both Asia and EMEA.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	Software revenue Software revenue consists of sales of third-party software and revenue realized from our own proprietary software products, which include software license sales, royalties from our software products, support and maintenance revenue, and royalties from certain engineering service contracts.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	Software revenue for 2016 and 2015 was as follows (dollars in thousands):
1054721_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	The vast majority of our third-party software revenue is comprised of sales of Microsoft Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	Third-party software revenue decreased $2.7 million, or 3%, in 2016 compared to 2015.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P35_S2	The decrease in third-party software revenue was due to a decrease in Microsoft Windows Mobile software sales due to lower volumes related to the age of the product, offset by an increase in Microsoft Embedded software sales, combined with a reduction in sales of other third-party software.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P35_S3	Proprietary software revenue decreased $1.4 million, or 42%, in 2016 compared to 2015.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P35_S4	This decline was due to several large purchases of our legacy products in 2015 that were not repeated in 2016.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P35_S5	We expect that proprietary software revenue from our legacy products will continue to fluctuate in the future with generally lower overall volume in 2017 and beyond.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P35_S6	Professional engineering service revenue Professional engineering service revenue for 2016 and 2015 was as follows (dollars in thousands):
1054721_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	Service revenue decreased $5.1 million, or 25%, in 2016 compared to 2015, due to decreases in service revenue generated in each of our three geographic areas: North America, Asia and EMEA.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P36_S1	The decreases in North America and EMEA service revenue were due to the completion of several existing customer projects and a shift in our sales generation priorities and staffing to DataV.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P36_S2	The decrease in Asia was due to lower revenue generated by sales in Japan.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P36_S3	Our largest professional engineering customers in 2016 were Google, Coca-Cola and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P36_S4	Our work for Ford, historically one of our largest customers, has been scaled back as the amount of our work on their increasingly mature Sync 2 platform continues to diminish.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	Gross profit and gross margin Cost of software revenue consists primarily of the cost of third-party software products payable to third-party vendors and support costs associated with our proprietary software products.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P37_S1	Cost of service revenue consists primarily of salaries and benefits, contractor costs and re-billable expenses, related facilities and depreciation costs, and amortization of certain intangible assets related to acquisitions.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	Gross profit on the sale of third-party software products is positively impacted by rebate credits we receive from Microsoft for embedded software sales earned through the achievement of defined objectives.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P38_S1	In accordance with Microsoft rebate program rules, we allocate 30% of rebate values to reduce cost of sales, with the remaining 70% to offset marketing expense in the period qualified marketing expenditures are incurred.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	Under the Microsoft rebate program, we recognized $345,000 and $326,000 of rebate credits in 2016 and 2015, res pectively, which were accounted for as reductions in cost of sales.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	We received $1.1 million and $0.8 million in rebates during 2016 and 2015, respectively, which were accounted for as reductions in marketing expenses.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P39_S2	There was a balance of approximately $469,000 in outstanding rebate credits for which we qualified as of December 31, 2016, which will reduce marketing expense if and when qualified program expenditures are made.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	The following table outlines software, services and total gross profit (dollars in thousands):
1054721_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	Software gross profit and gross margin Total software gross profit decreased by $1.3 million, or 8%, in 2016 compared to 2015, and total software gross margin decreased by one percentage point to 17% in 2016 from 18% in 2015.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	Third-party software gross margin was 15% in both 2016 and 2015.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P41_S2	Proprietary software gross margin was 83% in 2016 compared to 85% in 2015.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P41_S3	Although proprietary software revenue decreased by 42%, margin levels remained relatively stable due to the relatively fixed software cost of sales for these products.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P41_S4	Professional engineering service gross profit and gross margin Professional engineering service gross profit decreased $3.4 million, or 65%, in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a $5.1 million decrease in service revenue combined with a $1.8 million decrease in service cost of sales.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P41_S5	Service gross margin was 12% in 2016, a 13% decrease from 25% in 2015.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P41_S6	The decrease in service gross margin was due primarily to the decrease in service revenue as several projects finished in 2016 as well as to approximately $1.0 million in restructuring costs we incurred because of a reduction in workforce in the professional engineering services group in the third and fourth quarters of 2016.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	Operating expenses Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, commissions and bonuses for our sales, marketing and administrative personnel and related facilities and depreciation costs, as well as professional services fees (e.g., consulting, legal, audit and tax).
1054721_17_ITEM7_P42_S1	Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $1.7 million to $14.1 million in 2016 from $12.4 million in 2015.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P42_S2	This 14% increase was a result of higher spending in both sales and marketing including higher compensation expenses to support the launch of our DataV products, partially offset by lower general and administrative spending and stock compensation expenses.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P42_S3	Selling, general and administrative expenses represented approximately 14% of our total revenue in 2016 and approximately 11% in 2015.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P42_S4	The percentage was higher in 2016 due to the combination of lower revenue and higher expenses.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	Research and development Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for software development and quality assurance personnel, contractor and consultant costs and related facilities and depreciation costs.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	development and enhancements of our DataV product line.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	Research an d development expenses represented approximately 3% of total revenue in 2016 and 2% of total revenue in 2015.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	Research and development expenses are expensed when incurred.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P45_S2	Other income (expense), net Other income (expense) consists of interest income on our cash and investments, gains and losses we may recognize on our investments, gains and losses on foreign exchange transactions and other items.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P45_S3	Net other income was $247,000 in 2016 compared to net other income of $132,000 in 2015, representing a change of $115,000.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P45_S4	This change was primarily due to a sales tax refund received in 2016 and by higher interest income recorded in 2016 compared to 2015.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	Income taxes Income tax expense was $141,000 in 2016, based on loss before tax of $911,000, and was primarily composed of taxes on foreign income, primarily in Japan.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	Income tax expense was $470,000 in 2015, based on income before tax of $6.6 million.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P46_S2	Our effective tax rates were a negative 15.7% and positive 7.1% in 2016 and 2015, respectively, both of which are below the statutory rate of 34%, primarily due to the full valuation allowance on U.S. deferred tax assets.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	We apply the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 740, Income Taxes, which requires us to use judgment as to the appropriate weighting of all available evidence when assessing the need for the establishment or the release of valuation allowances.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	As part of this analysis, we examine all available evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis and weigh the positive and negative information when determining the need for full or partial valuation allowances.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P47_S2	The evidence we consider for each jurisdiction includes, among other items, (i) the historic levels of income or loss over a range of time periods that extends beyond the two years presented, (ii) the historical sources of income and losses, (iii) the expectations and risk associated with underlying estimates of future taxable income, (iv) the expectations and risk associated with new product offerings and uncertainties with the timing of future taxable income, and (v) prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	Based on the analysis conducted as of December 31, 2016, we determined the valuation allowance against our U.S. gross deferred tax assets was appropriate.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2016, we had $33.2 million of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash, compared to $30.0 million at December 31, 2015.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P48_S2	Of these amounts, $14.3 million and $16.4 million were classified as cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, Restricted cash equivalents of $250,000 at December 31, 2015 was classified as long-term.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P48_S3	This cash was restricted to support a letter of credit under the terms of our headquarters operating lease.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P48_S4	In September 2016, we secured a new letter of credit under our credit agreement that removed the requirement for a cash deposit.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P48_S5	Our working capital was $35.4 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $32.2 million at December 31, 2015.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P48_S6	Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.6 million in 2016, comprised of our net loss of approximately $1.1 million, combined with non-cash expenses of approximately $1.8 million and positive net working capital changes of approximately $1.8 million (including an increase in accounts receivable of $2.6 million and an increase in third-party software fees payable of $3.0 million).
1054721_17_ITEM7_P48_S7	Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.9 million in 2015, resulting from our net income of $6.1 million, positive net working capital changes of $5.5 million net of non-cash expenses of $2.3 million.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P48_S8	Net cash used for investing activities was approximately $5.8 million in 2016, primarily resulting from purchases of investment securities of approximately $30.6 million, offset by maturities of such securities of $25.0 million, combined with $0.4 million in fixed asset purchases and a reduction in restricted cash equivalents of $250,000.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P48_S9	Net cash used for investing activities was $0.3 million in 2015, resulting from full reinvestment of maturities from our investment portfolio combined with $0.3 million in fixed asset purchases.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P48_S10	Financing activities generated $1.1 million in 2016 and $0.7 million in 2015 resulting from the exercise of stock options.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments will be sufficient to meet our needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P49_S1	Our accounts receivable increased during 2016 resulting from extended payment terms granted to a highly-credit worthy customer.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P49_S2	We do not anticipate further such increases in 2017.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	In September 2015, we entered into a two-year unsecured line of credit agreement in the principal amount of up to $12 million.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	letter of credit with the landlord of our headquarters office lease with this credit agreement so the amount available at December 31, 20 16 is $11.75 million.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P51_S1	See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 12, Credit Agreement, for more information regarding this agreement.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	We have the following future or potential cash commitments:
1054721_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	In conjunction with our activities under our ODAs with Microsoft, we previously entered into OVRP commitments with Microsoft.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P53_S1	Under these OVRPs, we provided volume pricing on a customer-by-customer basis assuming certain minimum unit volumes were met.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P53_S2	The OVRP terms were 12 months.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P53_S3	In the event we did not meet the committed minimum unit volumes, we were obligated to pay the difference between the committed per-unit volume rate and the actual per-unit rate we achieved based upon actual units purchased.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P53_S4	The OVRP arrangements did not equate to a minimum purchase commitment but rather, the arrangements were a volume pricing arrangement based upon actual volume purchased.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P53_S5	In substantially all instances, we had reciprocal agreements with our customers such that we would receive per-unit price adjustments, similar to the amounts we would subsequently owe to Microsoft if such OVRP volumes were not met.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P53_S6	However, in the event a customer had been unwilling or unable to pay us, we could have been negatively impacted.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P53_S7	Based upon the credit-worthiness of our customers, our historical OVRP experience with our customers and OVRP arrangements in general, we do not believe we will incur any material liability in the current or future periods.
1054721_17_ITEM7_P53_S8	Microsoft has ended the OVRP arrangements effective January 1, 2016.
1054721_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data .
1054721_17_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BSQUARE Corporation (the Corporation ) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), shareholders equity and cash flows for the years then ended.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P1_S1	These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation s management.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P1_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P2_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1054721_17_ITEM8_P2_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P2_S2	The Corporation is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P2_S3	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P2_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P3_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P3_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P4_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of BSQUARE Corporation as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1054721_17_ITEM8_P9_S0	Description of Business BSQUARE Corporation ( BSQUARE ) was incorporated in Washington State in July 1994.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P9_S1	Since our inception, our business has largely been focused on providing software solutions (historically including reselling software from Microsoft Corporation ( Microsoft )) and related engineering services to businesses that develop, market and sell dedicated purpose standalone intelligent systems.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P9_S2	Examples of dedicated purpose standalone intelligent systems include smart, connected computing devices such as smart phones, set-top boxes, point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, tablets and handheld data collection devices, as well as smart vending machines, ATM machines, digital signs and in-vehicle telematics and entertainment devices.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P10_S0	We focus on systems that utilize various Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems as well as devices running other popular operating systems such as Android, Linux, and QNX, and that are usually connected to a network or data cloud via a wired or wireless connection.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P10_S1	Our customers include world-class original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ), original design manufacturers ( ODMs ), corporate enterprises ( Enterprises ), silicon vendors ( SVs ) and peripheral vendors.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P10_S2	A significant portion of our business historically has also been focused on reselling software from Microsoft, from which a majority of our revenue currently continues to be derived.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P11_S0	Beginning in 2014, we initiated development efforts focused on new proprietary software products addressing the Internet of Things ( IoT ) market, which is the interconnection of uniquely identifiable embedded computing devices within the existing internet infrastructure.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P11_S1	These software development efforts have driven a new business initiative for BSQUARE, which refer to as DataV TM .
1054721_17_ITEM8_P11_S2	Our DataV solution includes software products, applications and services that are designed to render raw IoT device data into meaningful and actionable data for our customers.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P11_S3	We launched DataV in early 2016 and announced our first three major bookings during 2016.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P11_S4	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of BSQUARE and our wholly owned subsidiaries.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P11_S5	All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P12_S0	Use of Estimates Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P12_S1	Examples include provisions for bad debts and income taxes, estimates of progress on professional engineering service arrangements, bonus accruals, fair value of intangible assets and property and equipment, fair values of stock-based awards and the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities, among other estimates.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P12_S2	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P13_S0	Basic income or loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, and excludes any dilutive effects of common stock equivalent shares, such as options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and warrants.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P13_S1	Restricted stock awards ( RSAs ) are considered outstanding and included in the computation of basic income or loss per share when underlying restrictions expire and the awards are no longer forfeitable.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P13_S2	Restricted stock units ( RSUs ) are considered outstanding and included in the computation of basic income or loss per share only when vested.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P13_S3	Diluted income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P13_S4	Common stock equivalent shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is anti-dilutive.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P13_S5	Unvested but outstanding RSUs and RSAs (which are forfeitable) are included in the diluted income per share calculation.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P14_S0	In a period where we are in a net loss position, the diluted loss per share is computed using the basic share count.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P15_S0	The following table presents a reconciliation of the number of shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted income (loss) per share (in thousands):
1054721_17_ITEM8_P16_S0	Common stock equivalent shares of 691,243 and 213,820 were excluded from the computations of basic and diluted income per share for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, because their effect was anti-dilutive.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P17_S0	Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments We invest our excess cash primarily in highly liquid debt instruments of U.S. government agencies and municipalities, debt instruments issued by foreign governments, corporate commercial paper, money market funds, and corporate debt securities.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P17_S1	We classify all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months as short-term investments.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P17_S2	Short-term investments consist entirely of marketable securities, which are all classified as available-for-sale securities and are recorded at their estimated fair value.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P17_S3	We determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P17_S4	We may or may not hold securities with stated maturities greater than 12 months until maturity.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P17_S5	As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify securities with maturities less than 12 months as short-term investments.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P17_S6	We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of shareholders equity, except for unrealized losses determined to be other than temporary, which are recorded in other expense.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P18_S0	Restricted Cash Our restricted cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2015 represented funds held at a financial institution as security for an outstanding letter of credit related to our corporate headquarters lease obligation.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P18_S1	The full balance of restricted cash equivalents was released in September 2016 when we entered into a new letter of credit agreement secured by our credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P19_S0	Financial Instruments and Concentrations of Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts receivable.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P20_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We record accounts receivable at the invoiced amount net of an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P20_S1	We review customers that have past due invoices to identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P20_S2	In determining the amount of the allowance, we make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P21_S0	Equipment, Furniture and Leasehold Improvements We account for equipment, furniture and leasehold improvements at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P21_S1	We compute depreciation of equipment and furniture using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three years.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P22_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful lives, ranging from two to ten years.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P22_S1	We expense maintenance and repairs costs as incurred.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P23_S0	When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, gains or losses are included in the consolidated statements of income.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P24_S0	When facts and circumstances indicate that the value of long-lived assets may be impaired, we perform an evaluation of recoverability comparing the carrying value of the asset to projected undiscounted future cash flows.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P25_S0	may not be recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss as a charge against current operations based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P26_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets were recorded as a result of business acquisitions and are stated at estimated fair value at the time of acquisition less accumulated amortization.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P27_S0	We amortize our acquired intangible assets using the straight-line method using lives ranging from one to ten years.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P28_S0	We review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P28_S1	We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P28_S2	If intangible assets are considered impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P29_S0	Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter annually, or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P29_S1	We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P29_S2	If we determine that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely greater than its carrying amount, we do not conduct further impairment testing.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P30_S0	If we determine that the fair value of the reporting unit is not more likely greater than the carrying amount, we perform a quantitative two-step impairment test.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P30_S1	The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P30_S2	If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, we then perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of any impairment loss.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P31_S0	We record all fees payable and accrued liabilities related to the sale of third-party software, such as Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, as third-party software fees payable.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P32_S0	Research and Development Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P32_S1	Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs would be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P33_S0	Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P33_S1	Generally, this would be reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing, and would occur shortly before the product is released.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P33_S2	Amortization of costs incurred after this point would be included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P33_S3	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had not recorded any such capitalized costs.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P34_S0	Advertising Costs All costs of advertising, including cooperative marketing arrangements, are expensed as incurred.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P34_S1	Advertising expense was $45,000 in 2016 and $23,000 in 2015.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P35_S0	The estimated fair value of stock based awards is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the award, net of estimated forfeitures.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P36_S0	We estimate forfeitures of stock based awards based on historical experience and expected future activity.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P36_S1	The fair value of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P36_S2	The fair value of stock option awards are estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of each vesting tranche as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton ( BSM ) option-pricing model.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P36_S3	The BSM model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and option life.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P36_S4	If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P37_S0	Comprehensive Income (Loss) Comprehensive income (loss) refers to net income (loss) and other revenue, expenses, gains and losses that, under generally accepted accounting principles, are recorded as an element of shareholders equity but are excluded from the calculation of net income (loss).
1054721_17_ITEM8_P38_S0	Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P38_S1	Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P39_S0	We compute income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred income taxes are provided for on the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P39_S1	Our deferred tax amounts are measured using currently enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P39_S2	We apply the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740, Income Taxes, which requires us to use judgment as to the appropriate weighting of all available evidence when assessing the need for the establishment or the release of valuation allowances.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P39_S3	As part of this analysis, we examine all available evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis and weigh the positive and negative information when determining the need for full or partial valuation allowances.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P39_S4	The evidence considered for each jurisdiction includes, among other items, (i) the historical levels of income or loss over a range of time periods that extends beyond the two years presented, (ii) the historical sources of income and losses, (iii) the expectations and risk associated with underlying estimates of future taxable income, (iv) the expectations and risk associated with new product offerings and uncertainties with the timing of future taxable income, and (v) prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P40_S0	Based on the analysis conducted as of December 31, 2016, we determined that we would not release, in full or in part, the valuation allowance against our U.S. gross deferred tax assets.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P40_S1	We recognize tax benefits from an uncertain position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based on its technical merits.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P40_S2	The tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P40_S3	Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are classified in the consolidated financial statements as income tax expense.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P41_S0	The functional currency of foreign subsidiaries is their local currency.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P41_S1	Accordingly, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P41_S2	Resulting translation adjustments are included in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, a separate component of shareholders equity.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P42_S0	The net gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are recorded in the period incurred and were not significant for any of the periods presented.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P43_S0	Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from software and engineering service sales when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the selling price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P43_S1	Contracts and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P43_S2	Shipping documents and time records are generally used to verify delivery.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P43_S3	We assess whether the selling price is fixed or determinable based on the contract and/or customer purchase order and payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P43_S4	We assess collectability based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer s payment history.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P43_S5	Periodically, we will begin work on engineering service engagements prior to having a signed contract and, in some cases, the contract is signed in a quarter after which service delivery costs are incurred.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P43_S6	We do not defer costs associated with such engagements before we have received a signed contract.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P43_S7	In certain rare circumstances, we will grant extended terms to highly credit-worthy customers.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P43_S8	The terms we offer are fixed and determinable; they are for sales of perpetual software licenses, they do not exceed twelve months in duration, they do not include multiple element arrangements requiring post-contract support, they do not permit returns or exchanges past thirty days and they do not require any additional services be provided by us.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P43_S9	We recognize software revenue upon delivery provided that no significant obligations remain on our part, substantive acceptance conditions, if any, have been met and other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P44_S0	from time and materials contracts, and training service agreements, as we perfo rm the services.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P44_S1	Fixed-price service agreements, and certain time and materials service agreements with capped fee structures, are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method assuming we can make reasonable estimates of completion.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P44_S2	We use the p ercentage-of-completion method of accounting because we believe it is the most accurate method to recognize revenue based on the nature and scope of these engineering service contracts and provides the best match of revenue recognized with costs incurred.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P44_S3	We measure the percentage of completion based primarily on input measures such as hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P44_S4	We use signif icant judgment when estimating total hours and progress to completion on these arrangements, which we use to determine the amount of revenue we recognize as well as whether a loss is recognized, if one is expected to be incurred for the remainder of the pr oject.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P45_S0	We incorporate revisions to hour and cost estimates during the period in which the causal facts become known.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P45_S1	In certain situations, when it is impractical for us to reliably estimate either specific amounts or ranges of contract revenues and costs, and where we anticipate that we will not incur a loss, a zero profit model is used for revenue recognition.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P45_S2	Equal amounts of revenue and cost are recognized during the contract period, and profit is recognized when the project is completed and accepted.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P45_S3	If the contract includes post-contract customer support and/or maintenance ( PCS ), profit is recognized over the PCS term.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P45_S4	We also enter into arrangements in which a customer purchases a combination of software licenses, engineering services and PCS.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P45_S5	As a result, judgment is often required to determine the appropriate accounting, including how to allocate the price among the deliverable elements if there are multiple elements.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P46_S0	PCS may include rights to upgrades, when and if available, telephone support, updates and enhancements.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P47_S0	We allocate revenue to each element based on the relative fair value of each of the elements in a multiple element arrangement, when vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) of fair value exists for all elements.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P47_S1	When the same element is sold separately, VSOE is established; when VSOE does not exist, judgments are required to assess the fair values of various elements of an agreement, which can impact the recognition of revenue in each period.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P47_S2	While changes in the allocation of the sales price between contract elements may affect the timing of revenue recognition, the total revenue recognized on the contract would not change.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P48_S0	When elements such as software and engineering services are contained in a single arrangement, or in related arrangements with the same customer, we allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value if such element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P48_S1	In the absence of fair value for a delivered element, we allocate revenue first to the fair value of the undelivered elements and then to the residual delivered elements.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P48_S2	In the absence of fair value for an undelivered element, we account for the arrangement as a single unit of accounting, which delays revenue recognition until all elements are fulfilled.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P48_S3	There are two items involving revenue recognition that require us to make more difficult and subjective judgments: the determination of VSOE of fair value in multiple element arrangements and the estimation of percentage of completion on fixed-price service contracts.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P49_S0	While we have entered into very few multiple-element arrangements for proprietary software historically, our initial DataV contracts each included multiple elements, including software licenses, installation, training services and PCS, and we anticipate this will continue to be the case for many future DataV contracts.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P49_S1	We have been unable to establish VSOE for DataV contracts to date.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P50_S0	When engineering services and royalties are contained in a single arrangement, we recognize revenue from professional engineering services as earned in accordance with the criteria above even though the effective rate per hour may be lower than typical because the customer is contractually obligated to pay royalties on their device shipments.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P50_S1	We recognize royalty revenue, classified as software revenue, when we receive the royalty report from the customer, or when such royalties are contractually guaranteed and the other revenue recognition criteria are met, when collectability is reasonably assured.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P50_S2	Revenue is recognized net of any applicable sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P50_S3	Shipping and handling costs are generally billed to customers and are included in cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P51_S0	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, amending revenue recognition guidance and requiring more detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P51_S1	The guidance, as amended, is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for public companies effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P51_S2	We are currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, and are currently planning to implement this ASU effective January 1, 2017.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P52_S0	adoption will not have a material impact on our traditional third-party so ftware or professional engineering services business, but that it will have a significant impact on the revenue recognition timing for our new DataV software products and services.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P52_S1	While we are continuing to assess all potential impacts of the new standard , we currently believe the most significant impact relates to our accounting for DataV arrangements that include term-based software licenses bundled with professional engineering services, and maintenance and support.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P52_S2	Under current GAAP, the revenue attri butable to these software licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement because VSOE does not exist for the undelivered maintenance and support element as it is not sold separately.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P52_S3	The requirement to have VSOE for undelivered elements to enable the separation of revenue for the delivered software licenses is eliminated under the new standard.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P52_S4	Accordingly, under the new standard there will be more performance obligations under the new standard as compared with the deliverables and units of account previously identified for DataV in which revenue was recognized over time.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P52_S5	As a result, this may yield earlier recognition of DataV revenue than under current accounting rules and may result in greater quarterly revenue recognition variability.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P52_S6	While we currently expect revenue recognition related to our traditional third-party software and professional engineering services business to remain unchanged, we are still in the process of evaluating the impact of the new standard on these arrangements.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P52_S7	Due to the complexity of certain of our contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the new standard for these arrangements may be dependent on contract-specific terms and therefore may vary in some instances.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P53_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P53_S1	The amendments in this ASU require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P53_S2	The amendments in this ASU apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P53_S3	The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this ASU.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P53_S4	We adopted the new guidance retrospectively beginning with the year ended December 31, 2014.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P53_S5	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-2, Leases, to make leasing activities more transparent and comparable, requiring most leases be recognized by lessees on their balance sheets as right-of-use assets, along with corresponding lease liabilities.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P53_S6	ASU 2016-2 is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 31, 2018 and interim periods within that year, with early adoption permitted.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P53_S7	We are currently evaluating the impact this ASU may have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P54_S0	In March 2016, the FASB amended the existing accounting standards for stock-based compensation, ASU 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P54_S1	The amendments impact several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, forfeitures, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P54_S2	We are required to adopt the amendments in the first quarter of 2017, with early adoption permitted.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P54_S3	If early adoption is elected, all amendments must be adopted in the same period.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P55_S0	The manner of application varies by the various provisions of the guidance, with certain provisions applied on a retrospective or modified retrospective approach, while others are applied prospectively.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P55_S1	We are currently evaluating the impact this ASU may have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P56_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, adding or clarifying guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P56_S1	The standard addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing diversity in practice.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P57_S0	ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P57_S1	We are currently evaluating the impact this ASU may have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P58_S0	Cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash consist of the following (in thousands):
1054721_17_ITEM8_P59_S0	Gross unrealized gains and losses on our cash equivalents and short-term investments were not material as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P59_S1	Our restricted cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2015 related to a letter of credit securing the lease of our corporate headquarters.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P59_S2	The restricted cash equivalents balance was released in September 2016 when we entered into a new letter of credit agreement secured by our credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P60_S0	We measure our cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash at fair value.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P61_S0	Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P61_S1	As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P61_S2	A three-tier fair value hierarchy is established as a basis for considering such assumptions and for inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:
1054721_17_ITEM8_P62_S0	Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P63_S0	Directly or indirectly observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs used in models or other valuation methodologies.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P64_S0	Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P64_S1	The inputs require significant management judgment or estimation.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P65_S0	We classify our cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash within Level 1 or Level 2.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P65_S1	This is because we value these items using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs that are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including third-party pricing services, brokers and market transactions.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P65_S2	We review the pricing techniques and methodologies of the independent pricing service for Level 2 investments and believe that the policies adequately consider market activity, either based on specific transactions for the security valued or based on modeling of securities with similar credit quality, duration, yield and structure that were recently traded.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P66_S0	Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in thousands):
1054721_17_ITEM8_P67_S0	Equipment, furniture, and leasehold improvements consist of the following (in thousands):
1054721_17_ITEM8_P68_S0	Depreciation and amortization expense of equipment, furniture and leasehold improvements was $468,000 in 2016 and $440,000 in 2015.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P69_S0	Goodwill was originally recorded in connection with the September 2011 acquisition of MPC Data, Ltd. (renamed BSQUARE EMEA, Ltd. in 2015), a United Kingdom based provider of software engineering services.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P69_S1	The excess of the acquisition consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill and is included within the professional engineering services reporting unit.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P69_S2	There were no changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P70_S0	Intangible assets relate to customer relationships that we acquired from TestQuest, Inc. in November 2008 and from the acquisition of BSQUARE EMEA, Ltd. in September 2011.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P70_S1	Information regarding our intangible assets is as follows (in thousands):
1054721_17_ITEM8_P71_S0	Amortization expense was $130,000 and $135,000 for 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P71_S1	As of December 31, 2016, expected amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets for each of the next five years and thereafter is as follows (in thousands):
1054721_17_ITEM8_P72_S0	The components of other income (expense), net are as follows (in thousands):
1054721_17_ITEM8_P73_S0	Income (loss) before income taxes consists of the following (in thousands):
1054721_17_ITEM8_P74_S0	Income tax expense consists of the following (in thousands):
1054721_17_ITEM8_P75_S0	The components of net deferred tax assets consist of the following (in thousands):
1054721_17_ITEM8_P76_S0	Our net deferred tax assets are recorded as follows (in thousands):
1054721_17_ITEM8_P77_S0	As of December 31, 2016, our deferred tax assets were primarily the result of U.S. net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P78_S0	valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in Japan.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P78_S1	Valuation allowances of $24.9 million and $24.6 million have been recorded against our gross deferred tax asset balances as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P79_S0	We apply the guidance of ASC 740, which requires us to use judgment as to the appropriate weighting of all available evidence when assessing the need for the establishment or the release of valuation allowances.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P79_S1	As part of this analysis, we examine all available evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis and weigh the positive and negative information when determining the need for full or partial valuation allowances.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P79_S2	The evidence considered for each jurisdiction includes, among other items, (i) the historical levels of income or loss over a range of time periods that extends beyond the two years presented, (ii) the historical sources of income and losses, (iii) the expectations and risk associated with underlying estimates of future taxable income, (iv) the expectations and risk associated with new product offerings and uncertainties with the timing of future taxable income, and (v) prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P80_S0	Based on the analysis conducted as of December 31, 2016, we determined that we would not release, in full or in part, the valuation allowance against our U.S. gross deferred tax assets.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P81_S0	The provision for income taxes differs from the amount of expected income tax expense determined by applying the applicable U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to pre-tax income (loss), as a result of the following (in thousands, except percentages):
1054721_17_ITEM8_P82_S0	At December 31, 2016, we had approximately $55.7 million of federal and $1.8 million of state net operating loss carryforwards, which have begun to expire, including $0.2 million of state losses which will expire in 2017.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P82_S1	Of the federal net operating loss carryforwards, an aggregate of $36.3 million will expire in 2022 and 2023.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P82_S2	We also have $2.8 million of tax credit carryforwards, which begin to expire in 2018.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P82_S3	Use of these carryforwards may subject us to an annual limitation due to Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code that restricts the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use its carryforwards.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P83_S0	Under the applicable tax rules, an ownership change occurs if holders of more than five percent of an issuer s outstanding common stock, collectively, increase their ownership percentage by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P83_S1	We have performed analyses of possible ownership changes in the past, which included consideration of third-party studies, and do not believe that an ownership change of more than 50 percentage points has occurred.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P83_S2	We have evaluated all the material income tax positions taken on our income tax filings to various tax authorities, and we determined that we did not have unrealized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions recorded at December 31, 2016 or 2015.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P83_S3	Because of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, substantially all of our tax years remain open and subject to examination.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P84_S0	Contingencies A third-party software vendor invoiced us a total of $934,000 for certain licensed software that was lost in transit by a common carrier during the second quarter of 2014.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P84_S1	We accrued a liability of $100,000 in the second quarter of 2014 as an estimate of our potential liability for legal and insurance deductible expenses.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P84_S2	During the first quarter of 2015, the vendor credited our account for the full $934,000 as the licenses had been deactivated and there was no indication of counterfeit use.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P84_S3	Accordingly, we reversed approximately $85,000 of the accrual after payment of legal expenses in the first quarter of 2015.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P85_S0	Our commitments include obligations outstanding under operating leases, which expire through 2020.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P85_S1	We have lease commitments for office space in Bellevue, Washington; Taipei, Taiwan; Trowbridge, UK; and Tokyo, Japan.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P85_S2	We also lease office space on a month-to-month basis in Akron, Ohio, and on an annual basis in San Diego, California and Boston, Massachusetts.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P85_S3	In August 2013, we amended the lease agreement for our Bellevue, Washington headquarters and extended the term of the original lease that was scheduled to expire in August 2014 to May 2020.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P85_S4	Rent expense was $1.0 million in 2016 and $1.1 million in 2015.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P85_S5	As of December 31, 2015, we had $250,000 pledged as collateral for a bank letter of credit under the terms of our headquarters facility lease.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P85_S6	The pledged cash supporting the outstanding letter of credit was recorded as restricted cash equivalents.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P85_S7	In September 2016, this letter of credit agreement was replaced by a letter of credit secured by our credit agreement and the corresponding restricted cash equivalents were returned to us.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P85_S8	Operating lease commitments at December 31, 2016 were as follows (in thousands):
1054721_17_ITEM8_P86_S0	Volume Pricing Agreements In conjunction with our activities under the OEM Distribution Agreements ( ODAs ) with Microsoft Corporation ( Microsoft ), we previously entered into OEM Volume Royalty Program ( OVRP ) commitments with Microsoft.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P86_S1	Under these OVRPs, we were provided with volume pricing on a customer-by-customer basis assuming certain minimum unit volumes were met.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P86_S2	The OVRP terms were 12 months.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P86_S3	In the event we did not meet the committed minimum unit volumes, we were obligated to pay the difference between the committed per-unit volume rate and the actual per-unit rate we achieved based upon actual units purchased.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P86_S4	The OVRP arrangements did not equate to a minimum purchase commitment but rather, the arrangements were a volume pricing arrangement based upon actual volume purchased.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P86_S5	In substantially all instances, we had reciprocal agreements with our customers such that we received per-unit price adjustments, similar to the amounts we would have subsequently owed to Microsoft if such OVRP volumes were not met.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P86_S6	However, in the event a customer was unwilling or unable to pay us, we would have been negatively impacted.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P86_S7	Based upon the credit-worthiness of our customers, our historical OVRP experience with our customers and OVRP arrangements in general, we did not believe we would incur any material liability in the current or future periods relating to existing agreements.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P87_S0	Microsoft has implemented significant pricing changes for its embedded products, including ending its design registration pricing discounts, terminating its OVRP and changing the aggregate volume price structure and product royalties for existing embedded Windows products effective January 1, 2016.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P87_S1	In December 2015, Microsoft granted extensions for certain of the OVRPs through 2016.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P88_S0	Equity Compensation Plans We have a stock plan (the Stock Plan ) and an inducement stock plan for newly hired employees (the Inducement Plan ) (collectively the Plans ).
1054721_17_ITEM8_P88_S1	Under the Plans, stock options may be granted with a fixed exercise price that is equivalent to fair market value on the date of grant.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P88_S2	These options have a term of up to 10 years and vest over predetermined periods, generally one to four years.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P88_S3	Incentive stock options granted under the Stock Plan may only be granted to our employees.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P88_S4	The Plans also allow for awards of non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSAs and unrestricted stock awards, and RSUs.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P89_S0	The estimated fair value of stock-based awards is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the award, net of estimated forfeitures.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P90_S0	We estimate forfeitures of stock based awards based on historical experience and expected future activity.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P91_S0	The fair value of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P91_S1	The fair value of stock option awards are estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of each vesting tranche as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton ( BSM ) option-pricing model.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P91_S2	The BSM model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and option life.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P91_S3	If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P92_S0	The fair values of our equity awards, primarily stock option grants, were estimated with the following weighted average assumptions:
1054721_17_ITEM8_P93_S0	The impact on our results of operations of recording stock-based compensation expense was as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):
1054721_17_ITEM8_P94_S0	The following table summarizes stock option activity under the Plans for 2016 and 2015:
1054721_17_ITEM8_P95_S0	At December 31, 2016, total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options granted under the Plans was $1,688,358, net of estimated forfeitures.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P95_S1	This cost will be amortized on the st raight-line method over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.69 years.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P96_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the quoted price of our common stock for the number of options t hat were in-the-money at year-end.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P97_S0	We issue new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P98_S0	The following table summarizes certain information about stock options:
1054721_17_ITEM8_P99_S0	The following table summarizes restricted stock unit activity under the Stock Plan for 2016 and 2015:
1054721_17_ITEM8_P100_S0	At December 31, 2016, total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock units granted under the Stock Plan was $368,505, net of estimated forfeitures.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P100_S1	This cost will be amortized on the straight-line method over a period of approximately 1.50 years.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P100_S2	Common Stock Reserved for Future Issuance The following table summarizes our shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under the Plans:
1054721_17_ITEM8_P101_S0	We have a Profit Sharing and Deferred Compensation Plan, The BSQUARE Corporation 401(k) Plan and Trust, (the Profit Sharing Plan ) under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P102_S0	Substantially all full-time employees are eligible to participate in the Profit Sharing Plan.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P103_S0	up to a certain amount subject to vesting.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P103_S1	Participants will receive their share of the value of their investments, and any applicable vested match, upon retirement or termination.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P103_S2	We made matching contributions of $321,000 in 2016 and $269,000 in 2015.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P103_S3	Of the annual matching contributions, none of the 2016 and $26,000 of the 2015 cont ributions were composed of transfers from the Profit Sharing Plan s forfeiture account.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P104_S0	Significant Customer Honeywell International Inc. accounted for 14% of total revenue in 2016 and 16% in 2015.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P104_S1	No other customers accounted for 10% or more of total revenue in either 2016 or 2015.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P104_S2	Honeywell International, Inc. and affiliated entities had total accounts receivable balances of $7.1 million, or 33% of total accounts receivable, and $6.1 million, or 32% of total accounts receivable, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P104_S3	No other customer accounted for 10% or more of total accounts receivable at December 31, 2016 or 2015.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P105_S0	We have two ODAs with Microsoft that enable us to sell Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems to our customers in the United States, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, the Caribbean (excluding Cuba), the E.U., the European Free Trade Association and Africa, which expire on June 30, 2017 and are typically renewed annually or bi-annually.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P105_S1	We also have four ODAs with Microsoft that allow us to sell Microsoft Windows Mobile operating systems in the Americas (excluding Cuba), Japan, Taiwan, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, which also expire on June 30, 2017 and are typically renewed annually or bi-annually.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P105_S2	Software sales under these agreements constitute a significant portion of our software revenue and total revenue.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P105_S3	These agreements are typically renewed annually or semi-annually; however, there is no automatic renewal provision in any of these agreements.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P105_S4	Further, these agreements can be terminated unilaterally by Microsoft at any time.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P106_S0	Microsoft currently offers a rebate program to sell Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems pursuant to which we earn money for achieving certain predefined objectives.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P106_S1	In accordance with Microsoft rebate program rules, we allocate 30% of rebate values to reduce cost of sales, with the remaining 70% to offset qualified marketing expenses in the period the expenditures are incurred.
1054721_17_ITEM8_P106_S2	Under this rebate program, we recognized $345,000 and $326,000 of rebate credits in 2016 and 2015, respectively, which were accounted for as reductions in cost of sales.

1054721_17_ITEM9A_P0_S1	In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as of December 31, 2016, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.
1054721_17_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2016.
1054721_17_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
1054721_17_ITEM9A_P0_S4	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1054721_17_ITEM9A_P0_S5	Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act and includes those policies and procedures that: (a) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (b) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (c) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

1054721_17_ITEM9A_P0_S7	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
1054721_17_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016.
1054721_17_ITEM9A_P1_S1	In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) .

1054721_18_ITEM1_P0_S0	CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the safe-harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P1_S0	Forward-looking statements can often be identified by words such as: "expect," "believe," "estimate," "plan," "strategy," "future," "potential," "continue," "may," "should," "will," and similar references to future periods.

1054721_18_ITEM1_P2_S0	Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances about future performance.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P2_S1	Instead, they are only predictions, based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions about the future of our business and other future conditions.

1054721_18_ITEM1_P2_S7	Our forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P2_S8	We discuss many of these risks, uncertainties and other factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in greater detail under the Item 1A Risk Factors.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P2_S9	We caution readers that our business and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P2_S10	BUSINESS Overview As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we, us , our , the Company and BSQUARE refer to BSQUARE Corporation.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P3_S0	Since our inception, our business has largely been focused on providing software solutions (historically, including reselling software from Microsoft Corporation ( Microsoft )) and related engineering services to businesses that develop, market and sell dedicated-purpose standalone intelligent systems.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P3_S1	Examples of dedicated-purpose standalone intelligent systems include smart, connected computing devices such as smart phones, set-top boxes, point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, tablets and handheld data collection devices, as well as smart vending machines, ATM machines, digital signs and in-vehicle telematics and entertainment devices.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P4_S0	We focus on systems that utilize various Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems as well as devices running other popular operating systems such as Android, Linux, and QNX, and that are usually connected to a network via a wired or wireless connection.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P4_S1	Our customers include world-class original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ), original design manufacturers ( ODMs ), corporate enterprises ( Enterprises ), silicon vendors ( SVs ) and peripheral vendors.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P4_S2	A significant portion of our business historically has also been focused on reselling software from Microsoft, from which a majority of our revenue currently continues to be derived.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P5_S0	Beginning in early 2014, we initiated development efforts focused on new proprietary software products addressing the Industrial Internet of Things ( IIoT ) market, by interconnecting of uniquely identifiable devices, extracting data from those devices and applying advanced analytics and machine learning to the data in order to derive meaningful and actionable insights.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P5_S1	While IIoT is a relatively new market, we believe the work we have engaged in since our inception namely adding intelligence and connectivity to discrete standalone devices and systems embodies much of what is central to the core functionality of IIoT.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P5_S2	These software development efforts have driven a new business initiative for BSQUARE, which we refer to as DataV .
1054721_18_ITEM1_P5_S3	Our DataV solution includes software products, applications and services that are designed to turn raw IIoT device data into meaningful and actionable data for our customers.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P5_S4	We launched DataV late in the first quarter of 2016 and announced our first three major customer bookings later that year.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P5_S5	These bookings comprised software licensing, software maintenance and related systems integration services and are, we believe, indicative of the potential customer demand for DataV.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P5_S6	During 2017 we began selling data analytics services and DataV application pilots to major industrial customers primarily in the transportation, oil and gas and manufacturing vertical markets, and signed four pilots in the first six months of 2017 and another fifteen pilots in the second half of 2017, the majority of which are still ongoing.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P6_S0	We believe that DataV presents high growth opportunit ies in a large, expanding addressable market, at substantially higher gross margins as compared to our traditional business.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P6_S1	Developing, selling and implementing DataV has become our primary focus, as approximately 65% of our non-administrative employees a re now working solely on DataV, representing a transition away from dependence on resale software and professional engineering services toward increased reliance on our own proprietary software and related systems integration services.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P6_S2	We intend to continu e to run our legacy software resale business to maximize cash flow for the foreseeable future.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P6_S3	Our legacy professional engineering services business is now managed as a part of our overall services business, which increasingly serves DataV customers and pr ospects.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P7_S0	We were incorporated in the State of Washington in July 1994.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P7_S1	Our principal office is located at 110 110th Avenue NE, Suite 300, Bellevue, Washington 98004, and our telephone number is (425) 519-5900.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P7_S2	The IIoT market is still emerging, but we believe it will present a large market opportunity for us.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P7_S3	This market includes consumer, business, government and industrial segments.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P7_S4	It encompasses software, hardware, connectivity and cloud providers as well as systems integrators.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P8_S0	While larger research firms do not yet widely track the size of the IIoT market, available research indicates to us that over time, the deployment of hundreds of billions of connected devices may generate trillions of dollars of economic value.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P8_S1	The IIoT marketplace is currently being influenced by the following factors:
1054721_18_ITEM1_P9_S0	Development of machine learning and data analytics software that advances the understanding of complex systems but lacks the capability to effectively process the proliferation of resulting data.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P10_S0	The increasing availability of inexpensive cloud computing and storage capabilities able to scale to the extent likely to be demanded by IIoT.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P11_S0	Software DataV Software DataV is BSQUARE s proprietary comprehensive software solution which addresses a variety of business use cases specific to IIoT applications, including:
1054721_18_ITEM1_P12_S0	Predictive Failure: By employing machine learning and advanced data analytics, DataV can predict, with varying levels of accuracy, future operational conditions for equipment or devices that are part of the overall IIoT system.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P13_S0	For many industrial concerns, the operational condition of greatest interest is a failure state.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P13_S1	By being able to predict failures before they occur, DataV customers can take steps to remediate the condition more quickly, less expensively and with less operational disruption.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P13_S2	DataV can also develop maintenance schedules from actual equipment usage and environmental data, reducing overall service costs and improving asset longevity.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	Adaptive Diagnostics: For equipment that has already failed, DataV can dynamically proscribe diagnostic and repair steps that have the highest probability of quickly and more cost-effectively resolving the problem.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	DataV employs machine learning, data analytics, and historical repair data to help customers identify underperforming assets and proscribe remediation steps to optimize performance.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	IIoT Device Management: The spread of data-generating devices in IIoT systems introduces a new set of operational problems for industrial concerns.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P16_S1	DataV can facilitate IIoT device management, including software and configuration updates, over large-scale populations of connected devices.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P17_S0	Asset Utilization: DataV can assist customers in tracking how their products are used in the field.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P17_S1	This can help ensure that equipment is used as intended, an important requirement for customers such as heavy equipment rental firms.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P17_S2	It can also provide product designers with feedback that can help improve product performance and differentiation.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P18_S0	Our DataV solution is designed to be implemented in a wide variety of industrial sectors and vertical markets, including commercial transportation, oil and gas extraction, manufacturing, water and power and other vertical markets.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P18_S1	These industrial sectors share common operational characteristics, such as the dependence on complex capital equipment where the cost of failure or sub-optimal performance is relatively high.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P18_S2	In other cases, our customers are seeking new revenue-generating products or services to enhance operating profitability.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P18_S3	In the future, we will be making DataV available through a software as a service ( SaaS ) revenue model.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P18_S4	We currently provide DataV software through hosted subscription or perpetual licensing models.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P18_S5	We officially launched DataV as a commercially available product in March 2016.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P18_S6	We secured our first order in May 2016 from PACCAR, Inc., a heavy-duty truck manufacturer, to employ adaptive diagnostics in order to more rapidly service and repair trucks.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P18_S7	This order, valued at $4.3 million, included a perpetual license to use DataV for that specific application on certain engine types in North America, as well as custom systems integration services and annual software maintenance fees.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P18_S8	We delivered the software and custom services in the first quarter of 2017, resulting in our first major DataV revenue.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P18_S9	In November 2016, we secured our second DataV order from Itron, Inc., a large global manufacturer of electric, water, and gas meters for utilities as well as smart city solutions targeting IIoT device management.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P18_S10	This order, valued at $4.8 million, included $1.9 million for the first year and a $2.9 million four-year extension option, and included a subscription license to use DataV in addition to maintenance and systems integration services.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P18_S11	In November 2017, Itron renewed its subscription exercising its extension option.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P18_S12	We are in the final stages of completing our hosted software delivery and expect Itron to accept delivery in early 2018.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P18_S13	In December 2016, we secured an order from a global provider of candy and beverages to help fulfill their smart vending initiative that adds intelligence to existing fleets of vending machines, better tracks real-time sales data and, in the future, better predicts equipment failures within these machines.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P18_S14	We expect this solution to be rolled out in phases beginning in the first quarter of 2018, providing expansion opportunities with increasing machine volumes and geographic territories.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P18_S15	In March 2017, we announced a series of applications, or apps, offering solutions addressing an array of business use cases.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P18_S16	These apps are designed to be platform agnostic and to be deployed on Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) or Microsoft Azure.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P18_S17	We entered into four customer pilot agreements in the second quarter of 2017, seven pilot agreements in the third quarter and eight pilot agreements in the fourth quarter, for a total of 19 new customer pilot agreements in 2017.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P18_S18	Most of these pilots are still ongoing.

1054721_18_ITEM1_P46_S4	The IIoT market is still emerging but is already becoming increasingly competitive.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P46_S5	Our competitors in this space include, or we anticipate could include, the following:
1054721_18_ITEM1_P47_S0	Cloud IIoT providers such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, and General Electric ( GE ) Predix.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	Startups funded to enter the IIoT market, including C3IOT and others.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P49_S0	In addition, we anticipate that we will encounter increasing competition in the growing IIoT market from a number of additional software and service providers as we continue to expand our focus on this market in 2018 and beyond.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P50_S0	The market for device software and engineering services is extremely competitive.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P50_S1	We face competition from the following:
1054721_18_ITEM1_P51_S0	Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating system distributors such as Arrow Electronics, Inc.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P52_S0	Marketing agencies and specialized vendors who provide mobile application services.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P53_S0	Some of our competitors focus on only one aspect of our business or offer complementary products that can be integrated with our products.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P53_S1	As we develop and bring to market new software products and service offerings, we may begin competing with companies with which we have not previously competed.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P53_S2	Further, as we expand the geographic markets into which we sell our software solutions and related services, or increase our penetration therein, we may expect to increasingly compete with companies with which we have not previously competed.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P53_S3	It is also likely that new competitors will enter the market or that our competitors will form alliances, including alliances with Microsoft or Amazon, that may enable them to rapidly increase their market share.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P53_S4	New competitors may have lower overhead than we do and may be able to undercut our pricing.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P53_S5	We expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter the connected device market, and as new products and technologies are introduced.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P53_S6	Neither Microsoft nor Amazon has agreed to any exclusive arrangement with us, nor has either agreed not to compete with us.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P53_S7	Amazon may decide to focus on providing products or services that compete directly with our products and services or partnering with other solution providers that compete with us.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P54_S0	services and expertise that we provide in-house, possibly resulting in reduced software and service revenue opportunit ies for us.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P55_S0	The barrier to entering the market as a provider of Microsoft-based smart connected systems software and services is low.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P55_S1	In addition, Microsoft has created marketing programs to encourage systems integrators to work on Windows Embedded and Win dows Mobile operating system software and services.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P55_S2	These systems integrators are given substantially the same access by Microsoft to Microsoft technology as we are.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P56_S0	Our international operations outside of North America consist principally of engineering services operations in Taipei, Taiwan and Trowbridge, England.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P56_S1	We have also maintained a sales and sales support office in Tokyo, Japan.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P56_S2	Because our OEM Distribution Agreement with Microsoft for the sale of Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems (e.g. Windows Embedded Compact) has previously been restricted to North America, the majority of our revenue continues to be generated from North America.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P56_S3	In 2017, revenue generated from customers located outside of North America was 6% of total revenue, compared to 5% in 2016.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P56_S4	See Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for more information regarding our international operations.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P56_S5	Our headcount by area was as follows:
1054721_18_ITEM1_P57_S0	Of the total headcount at December 31, 2017, 147 were located in North America, 22 in Taiwan, 28 in the United Kingdom and one in Japan.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P58_S0	As conditions necessitate, professional engineering service employees perform research and development activities and vice versa.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P59_S0	In general, we strive to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and through contractual arrangements.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P59_S1	However, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be effective to prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, or to prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to, or competitive with, those developed by us.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P59_S2	Additionally, because a significant portion of our revenue relates to the sale of third-party software products, we also rely on our partners, particularly Microsoft, to appropriately protect their own intellectual property.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P60_S0	As of January 31, 2018, we had fourteen pending United States ( US ) patent applications related to DataV, in addition to nine issued US patents related to other products and services.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P60_S1	We also have a number of registered trademarks in various jurisdictions.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P60_S2	We will continue to pursue appropriate protections for our intellectual property.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P60_S3	See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for more information regarding our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P61_S0	We electronically file with or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P61_S1	We make available on our website at www.bsquare.com, free of charge, copies of these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing such reports with, or furnishing them to the SEC.
1054721_18_ITEM1_P61_S2	The information contained in, or that can be accessed through, our website is not part of, and is not incorporated into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any of our other reports filed with or furnished to the SEC.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	As discussed under Item 1 of Part I, Business Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, our actual results could differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	that we currently deem immaterial but later emerge as material, may also impair our business operations.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and the trading price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	DataV-Related Risk Factors Beginning in early 2014, we initiated development efforts focused on new proprietary software products addressing the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) market.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We launched our DataV solution, which includes software products, applications and services that are designed to render raw IIoT device data into meaningful and actionable data for our customers, late in the first quarter of 2016.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Developing, selling and implementing DataV has become our primary focus, representing a transition away from dependence on resale software and professional engineering services toward increased reliance on our own proprietary software and related systems integration services.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The following DataV-related risks may negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our ability to maintain and grow our proprietary software revenue is contingent on the success of DataV, our proprietary business-focused IIoT solution.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P3_S2	If DataV fails to gain or maintain traction with potential customers, or if we are not otherwise successful in developing competitive, unique product and service offerings that keep pace with technological changes and needs, our business would be negatively impacted.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Proprietary software product revenue provides us with much higher gross profit margins than we typically receive from either our third-party software products or our engineering service offerings, and provides other advantages as well.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P3_S4	During 2017 and 2016, we invested significant resources in developing and marketing our DataV proprietary IIoT solution, which includes software products, applications and services designed to render raw device data into meaningful and actionable data.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our DataV customer engagements typically commence with an initial proof-of-concept (POC) or pilot project, after which it is anticipated that customers will convert to a fully paid license of DataV products and services.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	However, as a relatively new solution, DataV may gain customer traction more slowly than anticipated, or not at all.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We may be unsuccessful in converting customers from POCs and pilots to fully paid licenses, and our revenue and profit potential is uncertain.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P4_S3	We expect to continue to make significant investments in the development and marketing of DataV, and this will increase our operating expenses.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P4_S4	There can be no assurance that there will be sufficient revenue generated by sales of DataV, or that it will achieve customer adoption quickly, or at all.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Its failure would materially and adversely impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P4_S6	The IIoT is an emerging market, and there can be no assurance that the IIoT market will evolve as we expect, or that we will be successful in capitalizing on opportunities in this market.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P4_S7	We are currently devoting significant effort and resources to develop and launch our DataV solution to customers within the IIoT market.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	IIoT is an emerging and evolving market with many potential industry participants and customers, as well as undefined market opportunities and risks.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	This market may not materialize as we anticipate, and our efforts to capitalize on these opportunities may not be successful in the near term, or at all.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If the IIoT market does not materialize as we anticipate, or if our products and services do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition, and operating results would be adversely affect, any of which would likely cause our stock price to decline.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Transitioning our primary business from reselling software and professional engineering services to developing, marketing and selling our own proprietary DataV software and related systems integration services represents a significant shift of corporate focus and resources, and the failure to make this transition successfully would significantly harm our business and operating results.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P5_S4	The ongoing transition of our business to developing, marketing and selling our own proprietary DataV solution is subject to a number of significant risks, including:
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Customer acceptance of our proprietary solutions.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our failure to address these and other risks during this transition would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The long sales cycl e of our products and services makes our revenue susceptible to fluctuations.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Our sales cycle can run six to eighteen months because the expense and complexity of the software and service offerings we sell generally require a lengthy customer approval process and may be subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control, including:
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The timing of customers competitive evaluation processes.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	In addition, to successfully sell our software and engineering service offerings, we must frequently educate our potential customers about the full benefits of our software and services, including through the implementation of POCs or pilot programs, all of which can require significant time and expense.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	This is particularly true given the early stage of the IIoT market.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If our sales cycle further lengthens unexpectedly, or if we are unsuccessful in converting customers from POCs and pilots to fully paid licenses, it could adversely affect the timing of our revenue, which could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Our DataV operating results fluctuate, and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, our stock price could decline substantially.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Our DataV operating results fluctuate and are expected to continue to fluctuate.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Some of the important factors that may cause our DataV operating results to fluctuate include the following:
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The timing of recognition of DataV product and services revenue.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	These and other factors make it difficult to forecast our quarterly and annual financial results.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Many of these factors are not within our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to fluctuate and vary widely from our financial forecasts.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	As such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Moreover, we may also fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, and the market price of our common stock could decline.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P12_S4	If our security measures or those of third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers, or other service partners are breached or unauthorized access is otherwise obtained to our customers data, our data or our information technology ( IT ) systems, our or our customers confidential or personal information may be compromised or misappropriated, our products and services offerings may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our products and services, and we may incur significant legal and financial liability.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Our products and services involve the storage and transmission of customers proprietary data and personal information, and security breaches could result in a risk of loss of this data or information, litigation and possible liability.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P12_S6	While we have security measures in place, they may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our IT systems, our customers data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P12_S7	Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive personal information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers data, our data or our IT systems.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P12_S8	Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P12_S9	In addition, our customers may authorize third-party technology providers to access their customer data, and some of our customers may not have adequate security measures in place to protect their data.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P12_S10	Because we do not control the IT security of our customers or third-party technology providers, or of the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P12_S11	Malicious third parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our products and services.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P12_S12	Any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to legal liability.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P12_S13	Interruptions or delays in services from third-party data center hosting facilities or cloud computing platform providers could impair the delivery and availability of our products and services and harm our business.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We currently serve certain of our customers through third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in the United States and other countries.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Any da mage to, or failure of, these systems generally could result in interruptions in the availability of our products and services.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We have from time to time experienced, and may continue to experience, such interruptions, which could cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions, and adversely affect our customer attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers, all of which would reduce our revenue.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Our business would also be harmed if our customers and p otential customers believe our product and services offerings are unreliable.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for these third-party systems, which may expose us to potential claims, liab ilities and obligations for technology or services we did not develop or sell, all of which could harm our business.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Further, third-party software and cloud platforms that we currently or may in the future utilize may not continue to be available at reason able prices, on commercially reasonable terms, or may become unavailable.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P13_S6	Any of these outcomes could significantly increase our expenses and result in delays in the provisioning of our products and services until we are able to procure alternative solutio ns, either by developing equivalent technology or, if available, obtaining such technology through purchase or license from other third parties.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We do not control the operation or security of any of these hosting facilities or cloud computing platforms, and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct, as well as local administrative actions, changes to legal or permitting requirements and litigation to stop, limit or delay operation.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Despite precautions taken by providers of these facilities and platforms, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities or platforms without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities or platforms could result in lengthy interruptions in or cessation of our services.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Privacy concerns and laws, evolving regulation of cloud computing, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our products and services and adversely affect our business.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Regulation related to the provision of services on the internet is evolving and increasing, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage and use of personal information, such as the E.U. s Data Protection Directive and General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ).
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Further, laws and regulations are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes, such as the E.U. s ePrivacy Directive and ePrivacy Regulation.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Country-specific laws and regulations are subject to new and differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Existing laws and regulations, as well as future requirements, could reduce demand for our products and services or restrict our ability to store and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability to offer our products and services in certain locations or our customers' ability to deploy our solutions globally.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P16_S2	The costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by laws, regulations and standards such as GDPR may also limit the use and adoption of our products and services, reduce overall demand for our products and services, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, any of which could harm our business.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Furthermore, concerns regarding data privacy may cause our customers customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our products and services effectively.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products and services, and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P16_S5	Microsoft-Related Risk Factors Because we provide software and services to customers building devices utilizing Microsoft s Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, as well as the fact that a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, Microsoft has a significant direct and indirect influence on our business.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P16_S6	The following Microsoft-related risks may negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P16_S7	If we do not maintain our OEM Distribution Agreements with Microsoft or if Microsoft de-emphasizes or divests itself from these areas of its business, our revenue would decrease and our business would be adversely affected.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We have OEM Distribution Agreements ( ODAs ) for Software Products for Embedded Systems with Microsoft, which enable us to sell various Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems to our customers in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean (excluding Cuba), Mexico, the E.U. and the European Free Trade Association.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	These ODAs are effective through June 30, 2018 and are typically renewed annually or bi-annually.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We have also entered into ODAs with Microsoft pursuant to which we are licensed to sell Microsoft Windows Mobile operating systems to customers in North America, South America, Central America (excluding Cuba), Japan, Taiwan, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P17_S3	The ODAs to sell Windows Mobile operating systems are effective through June 30, 2018 and are typically renewed annually or bi-annually.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P17_S4	We generated $64.4 million and $78.8 million of revenue in 2017 and 2016, respectively, through our sales of Microsoft operating systems and expect this revenue stream to continue in 2018.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Microsoft can do unilaterally) or not ren ewed, or if Microsoft decides to no longer invest in or to divest itself from these areas of its business, our third-party software revenue and resulting gross profit could decrease significantly and our operating results would be negatively impacted.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Futu re renewals by Microsoft, if any, could be on less favorable terms, which could also negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Microsoft can change pricing under the ODAs at any time, and unless we are able to pass through price increases to our customers, our revenue, gross profit and operating results would be negatively impacted.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Further, Microsoft currently offers a rebate program in conjunction with our ODA activities in which we earn money for achieving certain predefined objectives.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P18_S4	If Microsoft were to eliminate or negatively modify the rebate program, our gross profit and operating results would be negatively impacted.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P18_S5	We qualified for rebate credits from Microsoft of $1.7 million and $1.2 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, a portion of which is accounted for as a reduction in cost of sales and a portion as a reduction in marketing expense if and when qualified expenditures are made.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted by changes Microsoft implements in its pricing of its operating systems.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P18_S7	Microsoft implemented significant pricing changes for its operating systems products, including ending its design registration pricing discounts, terminating its OEM Volume Royalty Program ( OVRP ) and changing the aggregate volume price structure and product royalties for existing Windows Embedded products effective January 1, 2016, and Microsoft could make further pricing changes in the future.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P18_S8	These changes have altered the competitive dynamics because the same pricing discounts are available to all distributors of these Microsoft products.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P18_S9	As a distributor of Microsoft products, this impacts both the sales prices we charge our customers and the cost of goods sold we incur for many of the Microsoft products we sell.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P18_S10	The amount and impact of these changes to our revenue and gross profit are not determinable; however, they may negatively impact our operating results in future reporting periods.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P18_S11	The sale of Microsoft operating systems represented approximately 80% and 81% of our total revenue and approximately 54% and 74% of our total gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P18_S12	Microsoft has audited our records under the ODAs in the past and may audit our records again in the future, and any negative audit results could result in additional charges and/or the termination of the ODAs.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	There are provisions in the ODAs that require us to maintain certain internal records and processes for auditing purposes.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Non-compliance with these or other contractual requirements could result in the termination of the ODAs.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Microsoft concluded audits of our records pertaining to the ODAs in 2009 and 2006, neither of which had material findings.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	It is possible that future audits could result in charges due to any material findings that are found.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The ODA provisions also include terms that may make us contractually liable for payment of royalties to Microsoft in the event that certificates of authenticity are lost, damaged or stolen.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Our business and results of operations would be adversely impacted if Microsoft decided to provide Windows Embedded or Windows Mobile operating systems free of charge to customers.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Microsoft offers certain consumer Windows phone and tablet-based operating systems to customers free of charge, subject to certain limitations.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	While we do not distribute these operating systems today under our ODAs with Microsoft, if Microsoft were to offer, free of charge, operating systems that we do distribute, our business and results of operations would be adversely impacted.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P22_S2	If the markets for Windows Embedded and/or Windows Mobile operating systems decline, our business and operating results would be materially harmed.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Because a significant portion of our revenue to date has been generated by software and services targeted at customers and devices running various Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, if the markets for these systems decline, our business and operating results would be negatively impacted.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Continued market acceptance of Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems will depend on many factors, including:
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Microsoft s development and support of various Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile markets.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The ability of the Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems to compete against existing and emerging operating systems for the smart connected systems market, including: iOS from Apple, Inc., VxWorks and Linux from WindRiver Systems Inc.; Android from Google Inc.; QNX from BlackBerry Limited; and other proprietary operating systems.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The willingness of software developers to continue to develop and expand the applications running on Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	To the extent that software developers write applications for competing operating systems that are more attractive to users than those available on Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, this could cause potential customers to select competing operating systems.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	General Business-Related Risk Factors Our marketplace is extremely competitive, which may result in price reductions, lower gross profit margins and loss of market share.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The IIoT market is still emerging but is already becoming increasingly competitive.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Our competitors in this space include, or we anticipate could include, the following:
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Cloud IIoT providers such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, and GE Predix.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Startups funded to enter the IIoT market, including C3IoT and others.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	In addition, we anticipate that we will encounter increasing competition in the growing IIoT market from a number of additional software and service providers as we continue to expand our focus on this market in 2018 and beyond.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	The market for device software and engineering services is extremely competitive.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	We face competition from the following:
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating system distributors such as Arrow Electronics, Inc.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Marketing agencies and specialized vendors who provide mobile application services.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Some of our competitors focus on only one aspect of our business or offer complementary products that can be integrated with our products.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	As we develop and bring to market new software products and service offerings, we may begin competing with companies with which we have not previously competed.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Further, as we expand the geographic markets into which we sell our software solutions and related services, or increase our penetration therein, we may expect to increasingly compete with companies with which we have not previously competed.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P34_S3	It is also likely that new competitors will enter the market or that our competitors will form alliances, including alliances with Microsoft or Amazon, that may enable them to rapidly increase their market share.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P34_S4	New competitors may have lower overhead than we do and may be able to undercut our pricing.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P34_S5	We expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter the connected device market, and as new products and technologies are introduced.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P34_S6	Neither Microsoft nor Amazon has agreed to any exclusive arrangement with us, nor has either agreed not to compete with us.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P34_S7	Amazon may decide to focus on providing products or services that compete directly with our products and services or partnering with other solution providers that compete with us.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P34_S8	Microsoft may decide to bring more of the core embedded development services and expertise that we provide in-house, possibly resulting in reduced software and service revenue opportunities for us.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The barrier to entering the market as a provider of Microsoft-based smart connected system software and services is low.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	These systems integrators are given substantially the same access by Microsoft to Microsoft technology as we are.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Management turnover creates uncertainties and could harm our business.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P37_S1	We have had significant changes in executive leadership in the past and more could occur.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Changes to strategic or operating goals, which can often occur with the appointment of new executives, can create uncertainty, may negatively impact our ability to execute quickly and effectively, and may ultimately be unsuccessful.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P37_S3	In addition, executive leadership transition periods are often difficult as the new executives gain detailed knowledge of our operations, and friction can result from changes in strategy and management style.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Management turnover inherently causes some loss of institutional knowledge, which can negatively affect strategy and execution.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Until we integrate new personnel, and unless they are able to succeed in their positions, we may be unable to successfully manage and grow our business, and our financial condition and profitability may suffer.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Further, to the extent we experience additional management turnover, competition for top management is high and it may take months to find a candidate that meets our requirements.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P38_S3	If we are unable to attract and retain qualified management personnel, our business could suffer.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Because competition for technology industry employees is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our operations and grow our business.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	In the technology industry generally, and in the greater Seattle area in particular, there is intense competition for software engineers, as well as for technology sales and operations personnel.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P39_S1	We may not be successful in attracting or retaining such qualified personnel.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P39_S2	If we fail to attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business would be harmed.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P39_S3	We depend on our direct sales force to achieve planned revenue growth in the future, and if our sales force is not successful, our financial condition will be harmed.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P39_S4	We sell our solutions primarily through our direct sales force.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P39_S5	Our ability to achieve planned revenue growth in the future will depend upon the success of our direct sales force and our ability to adapt our sales efforts to address the evolving markets for our solutions.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P39_S6	If our direct sales force does not perform as expected, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be adversely affected.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P39_S7	Our operating results may be adversely affected by changing economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P39_S8	Uncertain economic and political conditions in the U.S. and worldwide have from time to time contributed, and may continue to contribute, to volatility in the technology industries at large, particularly in an emerging market such as IIoT. These factors could potentially result in reduced demand for our products and services as a result of constraints on IT-related capital spending by our customers; purchasing delays; payment delays adversely affecting our cash flow and revenue; and difficulty in accurate budgeting and planning.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P39_S9	If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in key markets, remain uncertain or deteriorate, we may experience material impacts on our business, operating results and financial condition.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P39_S10	Our business and operations would be adversely impacted in the event of a failure or interruption of our IT infrastructure.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P39_S11	The proper functioning of our own IT infrastructure is critical to the efficient operation and management of our business.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P39_S12	Our IT is vulnerable to cyberattacks, computer viruses, worms and other malicious software programs, physical and electronic break-ins, sabotage and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P39_S13	We believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology infrastructure and our operations from these IT-related and other potential disruptions.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P39_S14	However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or personal information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P39_S15	We may be subject to product liability, infringement or other legal claims that could result in significant costs.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P39_S16	Our software license and service agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability, infringement and other legal claims.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P39_S17	It is possible, however, that these provisions may be ineffective under the laws of certain jurisdictions or that our customers may not agree to these limitations.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P39_S18	Although we have not experienced any product liability or infringement claims to date, as our business focus continues to transition to the sale of our own proprietary products, the sale and support of our products and services may be subject to such claims in the future.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	claims or liabilities may exceed, or fall outside , the scope of our insurance coverage, and we may be unable to obtain adequate liability insurance in the future.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P40_S1	A product liability, infringement or other legal claim brought against us, whether successful or not, could negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Our business and results of operations would be adversely impacted in the event that we incur business losses that are not covered by or exceed our existing business insurance coverage.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P40_S3	We are insured against certain business risks and liabilities under our corporate insurance policies.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P40_S4	However, to the extent that we incur losses in connection with our business that are not covered by our existing insurance policies or that exceed our existing policy coverage, our business and results of operations would be adversely impacted.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P40_S5	Negative business conditions, changes in useful lives, and other factors may negatively affect the carrying value of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P40_S6	We evaluate goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P40_S7	Reductions in operating cash flows or projected cash flows of our reporting units could result in an impairment charge that would negatively impact our operating results.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P40_S8	Further, business conditions and other factors may also require us to reassess the useful lives associated with intangible assets.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P40_S9	Past acquisitions have proven difficult to integrate, and future acquisitions, if any, could disrupt our business, dilute shareholder value and negatively affect our operating results and may not accrete to our revenue or other operating results or to our business generally.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We have acquired the technologies, assets and/or operations of other companies in the past and may acquire or make investments in companies, products, services and technologies in the future as part of our growth strategy.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P41_S1	If we fail to properly evaluate, integrate and execute on our acquisitions and investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P41_S2	In addition, acquisitions may not be as accretive to our revenue or other operating results as expected.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P41_S3	To successfully complete an acquisition, we must properly evaluate the business, technology, market and management team of the acquisition target, accurately forecast the financial impact of the transaction, including accounting charges and transaction expenses, integrate and retain personnel, combine potentially different corporate cultures and effectively integrate products, research and development, sales, marketing and support operations.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P41_S4	If we fail to do any of these, we may suffer losses and impair relationships with our employees, customers and strategic partners.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P41_S5	Additionally, acquisition activities may distract management from day-to-day operations.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P41_S6	We also may be unable to maintain consistently uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies across our entire business as a result, and significant additional demands may be placed on our management and our operations, information services and financial, legal and marketing resources.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P41_S7	Finally, acquired businesses may result in unexpected liabilities and contingencies, which may involve compliance with foreign laws, payment of taxes, labor negotiations or other unknown costs and expenses, which could be significant.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P41_S8	We may not be able to access our existing credit facility or raise additional capital if required to support our business, and the issuance of additional equity or convertible debt securities would result in the dilution of our existing shareholders.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P41_S9	Our continuing investment in our DataV business has resulted in a decrease in our cash, cash equivalents and investments from approximately $33.2 million at December 31, 2016 to approximately $24.8 million at December 31, 2017, and we expect to continue making ongoing investments in our DataV business for the foreseeable future.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P41_S10	In addition, Honeywell International, Inc. had accounts receivable balances of approximately $7.1 million at December 31, 2016 and $8.7 million at December 31, 2017 with net 270-day payment terms, which limits our ability to access these funds on a more current basis.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P41_S11	If we need to raise additional operating capital, it may be difficult and costly to access the public equity and debt capital markets.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P41_S12	In the past, our stock has traded at low volumes and overall investor confidence in the stock market could falter.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P41_S13	This could make it difficult or impossible to sell additional shares of our stock in the public market.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P41_S14	In addition, we may not be able to access our existing credit facility if we are not in compliance with certain financial and other covenants, and it may be difficult and costly to obtain additional commercial debt financing and we may be unable to borrow additional funds at acceptable cost, or at all, should the need arise.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P41_S15	If we are unable to raise capital as necessary, it may adversely affect our ability to invest in products or fund operations, which would materially harm our business and negatively affect operating results.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P41_S16	If we decide to raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership percentages of our existing shareholders would be reduced.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P41_S17	Our common stock has experienced and may continue to experience price and volume fluctuations, which could lead to costly litigation for us and make an investment in us less appealing.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Stock markets are subject to significant price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies and the market price of our common stock may therefore frequently change as a result.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	including quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations (including as a result of fluctuations in our revenue recognition), announcements about technological innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors, market acceptance o f new products and services offered by us, developments in the IIoT market, changes in our relationships with our suppliers or customers, our ability to meet analysts expectations, changes in the information technology environment, changes in earnings est imates by analysts, sales of our common stock by existing holders and the loss of key personnel.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s stock, class action securities litigation has often been instituted against suc h companies.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management s attention and resources, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P44_S2	We could become subject to taxation in jurisdictions in which we do not believe we currently have tax nexus, which could expose us to additional tax liability that we have not been subject to in the past.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We make sales in many jurisdictions across the United States.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P45_S1	We believe we do not have nexus in most of these jurisdictions and, therefore, we believe we are not subject to sales, franchise, income and other state and local taxes in such jurisdictions.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P45_S2	However, if we are determined to have tax nexus in other jurisdictions (as a result of more aggressive interpretations of nexus by taxing jurisdictions or otherwise) and we are unable to pass through this cost to our customers, our tax expense will increase which will negatively affect our results of operations.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Further, because state and local tax laws are becoming increasingly complex, we anticipate that our cost to monitor our state and local tax compliance will increase which will negatively affect our results of operations.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P45_S4	Additionally, there can be no assurance that we do not currently have unknown tax exposure in a state or local tax jurisdiction because of recent tax law changes of which we are unaware and the resulting liability could be significant and would negatively affect our results of operations.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	There may be restrictions on the use of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards due to a tax law ownership change.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Sections 382 and 383 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code restrict the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P46_S2	At December 31, 2017, we had approximately $61.6 million of federal and $4.4 million of state net operating loss carryforwards and $3.0 million of tax credit carryforwards.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Of the federal net operating loss carryforwards, an aggregate of $36.3 million will expire in 2022 and 2023.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Under the applicable tax rules, an ownership change occurs if greater than five percent shareholders of an issuer s outstanding common stock collectively increase their ownership percentage by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P47_S1	We have performed analyses of possible ownership changes which included consideration of a third-party study, and do not believe that an ownership change as defined by Section 382 has occurred.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P47_S2	However, if a tax law ownership change has occurred of which we are not aware, or if a tax law ownership change occurs in the future, we may have to adjust the valuation of our deferred tax assets, and could be at risk of having to pay income taxes notwithstanding the existence of our sizable carryforwards.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Further, to the extent that we have utilized our carryforwards from prior years, the existence of a previous tax law ownership change that we did not account for could result in liability for back taxes, interest, and penalties.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P47_S4	If we are unable to utilize our carryforwards and/or if we previously utilized carryforwards to which we were not entitled, it would negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P47_S5	Changes in our effective tax rate may impact our results of operations.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We are subject to taxes in the U.S. and other jurisdictions.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Tax rates in these jurisdictions may be subject to significant change due to economic and/or political conditions.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P48_S2	A number of other factors may also impact our future effective tax rate including:
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law new legislation that significantly revises the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits (including reducing the business tax credit for certain clinical testing expenses incurred in the testing of certain drugs for rare diseases or conditions) .
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the new federal tax law is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P52_S1	In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various st ates will conform to the newly enacted federal tax law.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P52_S2	The impact of this tax reform on holders of our common stock is also uncertain and could be adverse.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P52_S3	We urge our stockholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to this legislat ion and the potential tax consequences of investing in or holding our common stock.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Intellectual Property-Related Risk Factors Our software and service offerings could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which could expose us to additional costs and litigation and could adversely affect our ability to sell our products and services or cause shipment delays or stoppages.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P53_S1	It is difficult to determine whether our software products, including DataV, and engineering services infringe third-party intellectual property rights, particularly in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which technologies often overlap and where there may be numerous patent applications pending, many of which are confidential when filed.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P53_S2	If we were to discover that one of our software products or service offerings, or a product based on one of our reference designs, violated a third party s proprietary rights, we may not be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, to continue offering that product or service.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P53_S3	Similarly, third parties may claim that our current or future software products and services infringe their proprietary rights, regardless of whether such claims have merit.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P53_S4	Any such claims could increase our costs and negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	In certain cases, we have been unable to obtain indemnification against claims that third-party technology incorporated into our software products and services infringe the proprietary rights of others.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P54_S1	However, any indemnification we do obtain may be limited in scope or amount.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Even if we receive broad third-party indemnification, these entities may not have the financial capability to indemnify us in the event of infringement.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P54_S3	In addition, in some circumstances we are required to indemnify our customers for claims made against them that are based on our software products or services.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P54_S4	There can be no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims related to the software products and services we provide, or arising from the incorporation by us of third-party technology, and claims for indemnification from our customers resulting from such claims, will not be asserted or prosecuted against us.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P54_S5	Some of our competitors have, or are affiliated with companies with, substantially greater resources than we have, and these competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than we could.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P54_S6	In addition, we expect that software developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the software industry grows, and as the functionality of products in different industry segments increasingly overlap.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P54_S7	Such claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources in addition to potential product redevelopment costs and delays.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P54_S8	Furthermore, if we were unsuccessful in resolving a patent or other intellectual property infringement action claim against us, we may be prohibited from developing or commercializing certain of our technologies and products, or delivering services based on the infringing technology, unless we obtain a license from the holder of the patent or other intellectual property rights.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P54_S9	There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain any such license on commercially favorable terms, or at all.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P54_S10	If such license were not obtained, we would be required to cease these related business operations, which could negatively impact our business, revenue and operating results.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P54_S11	If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may be able to use our technology or trademarks, which could weaken our competitive position, reduce our revenue and increase our costs.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P54_S12	If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, our competitive position could be weakened and our revenue and operating results adversely affected.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P54_S13	We rely primarily on confidentiality policies and procedures and contractual provisions as well as a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, to protect our intellectual property.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P54_S14	These laws, policies and procedures provide only limited protection.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P54_S15	It is possible that another party could obtain patents that block our use of some, or all, of our software products and services, including DataV. If that occurred, we would need to obtain a license from the patent holder or design around those patents.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P54_S16	The patent holder may or may not choose to make a license available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P54_S17	Similarly, it may not be possible to design around a blocking patent.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P54_S18	In general, there can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws will be effective to prevent misappropriation of our technology, or to prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to or competitive with those developed by us.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We frequently license our computer source code to customers.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P56_S0	To license some of our software products, we rely in part on shrink-wrap and click wrap licenses that are not signed by the end user and, theref ore, may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P56_S1	As with other software, our software products are susceptible to unauthorized copying and uses that may go undetected, and policing such unauthorized use is difficult.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P57_S0	A significant portion of our marks include the word BSQUARE.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Other companies use forms of BSQUARE in their marks alone, or in combination with other words, and we cannot prevent all such third-party uses.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We license certain trademark rights to third parties.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Such licensees may not abide by our compliance and quality control guidelines with respect to such trademark rights.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P58_S2	Any of these outcomes could negatively impact our brand, dilute its recognition in the marketplace, or confuse potential customers, all of which could ha rm our business.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P59_S0	The computer software market is characterized by frequent and substantial intellectual property litigation, which is often complex and expensive, and involves a significant diversion of resources and uncertainty of outcome.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property or to defend against a claim of infringement or invalidity.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Litigation could result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources and could negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Our software or hardware products or the third-party hardware or software integrated with our products or delivered as part of our service offerings may suffer from defects or errors that could impair our ability to sell our products and services.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P59_S4	Software and hardware components as complex as those needed for dedicated purpose intelligent systems frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P59_S5	We have had to delay commercial release of certain versions of our products until problems were corrected and, in some cases, have provided product enhancements to correct errors in released products.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P59_S6	Some of our contracts require us to repair or replace products that fail to work.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P59_S7	To the extent that we repair or replace products, our expenses may increase.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P59_S8	In addition, it is possible that by the time defects are fixed, the market opportunity may decline which may result in lost revenue.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P59_S9	Moreover, to the extent that we provide increasingly complex and comprehensive products and services, particularly those focused on IIoT hardware, and rely on third-party manufacturers and suppliers to manufacture these products, we will be dependent on the ability of such third-party manufacturers and suppliers to correct, identify and prevent manufacturing errors or defects.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P59_S10	Errors or defects that are discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance, diversion of development resources, damage to our reputation and increased service and warranty costs, all of which could negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P59_S11	If we are unable to license key software from third parties, our business could be harmed.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P59_S12	We sometimes integrate third-party software with our proprietary software and engineering service offerings or sell such third-party software offerings on a standalone basis (e.g. Microsoft Windows Embedded and Mobile operating systems under our ODAs with Microsoft).
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P59_S13	If our relationships with these third-party software vendors were to deteriorate, or be eliminated in their entirety, we might be unable to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P59_S14	In the event that we are unable to obtain these third-party software offerings, we would be unable to continue to generate revenue from our reseller relationships or, with respect to our proprietary software and engineering services offerings, we would be required to develop this technology internally, assuming it was economically or technically feasible, or seek similar software offerings from other third parties assuming there were competing offerings in the marketplace, which could delay or limit our ability to introduce enhancements or new products, or to continue to sell existing products and engineering services, thereby negatively impacting our revenue and operating results.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Governance-Related Risk Factors It might be difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation, bylaws and Washington law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in the control of us or a change in our management, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Our Board of Directors has the authority under our articles of incorporation to issue preferred stock with rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P60_S3	As a result, preferred stock could be issued quickly and easily with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make removal of our management more difficult.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P60_S4	In addition, our Board of Directors is divided into three classes.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P60_S5	The directors in each class serve for three-year terms, one class being elected each year by our shareholders.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P60_S6	This system of electing and removing directors may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company because it generally makes it more difficult for shareholders to replace a majority of our directors.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P60_S7	In addition, Chapter 19 of the Washington Business Corporation Act generally prohibits a target corporation from engaging in certain significant business transactions with a defined acquiring person for a period of five years after the acquisition, unless the transaction or acquisition of shares is approved by a majority of the members of the target corporation s Board of Directors prior to the time of acquisition.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P60_S8	This provision may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of our company.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P60_S9	The existence of these anti-takeover provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P61_S0	International Operations-Related Risk Factors Our international operations expose us to greater intellectual property, management, collections, regulatory and other risks.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Customers outside of North America generated 6% of our total revenue in 2017 and 5% in 2016.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P61_S2	We currently have sizable operations outside of North America in Taiwan and the United Kingdom ( U.K. ).
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Our international activities and operations expose us to a number of risks, including the following:
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Complex and/or adverse tax laws and/or changes thereto.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P63_S0	The inherent risks of working in a certain highly regulated and/or controlled economies where relationships between company management and government officials is critical to timely processing of approvals required to conduct business.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P64_S0	In addition, on June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the E.U., commonly referred to as Brexit .
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Because of the referendum, it is expected that the British government will begin negotiating the terms of the U.K. s future relationship with the E.U.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Although it is unknown what those terms will be, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the U.K. and E.U. countries and increased regulatory complexities, which could adversely impact our operations and business in both the U.K. and the E.U.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P65_S0	These risks could have a material adverse effect on the financial and managerial resources required to operate our foreign offices, as well as on our future international revenue, which could negatively impact our business and operating results.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P65_S1	As our customers seek more cost-effective locations to develop and manufacture their products, particularly overseas locations, our ability to continue to sell our software products and services to these customers could be adversely affected, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P65_S2	Due to competitive and other pressures, some of our customers have moved, and others may seek to move, the development and manufacturing of their smart, connected systems to overseas locations, which may limit our ability to sell our software and services to these customers.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P65_S3	As an example, under our ODAs with Microsoft, we are currently only able to sell Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems to our customers in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean (excluding Cuba), Mexico, the E.U. and the European Free Trade Association.
1054721_18_ITEM1A_P65_S4	If our customers, or potential customers, move their manufacturing overseas to locations in which our business may be limited, we may be less able to remain competitive, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.
1054721_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	As of December 31, 2017, our corporate headquarters were located in 24,061 square feet of leased space in a single location in Bellevue, Washington.
1054721_18_ITEM2_P0_S1	The lease term ends in May 2020.
1054721_18_ITEM2_P1_S0	In North America, we also lease office space in Boston, Massachusetts and Akron, Ohio.
1054721_18_ITEM2_P1_S1	We lease off ice space overseas in Tokyo, Japan; Taipei, Taiwan; and Trowbridge, England, U.K.
1054721_18_ITEM2_P1_S2	Our facilities have sufficient capacity to support our current operational needs as well as short-term growth plans.

1054721_18_ITEM5_P1_S0	Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol BSQR.
1054721_18_ITEM5_P1_S1	The following table sets forth the high and low closing prices for our common stock for the periods indicated, as reported by the NASDAQ Global Market.
1054721_18_ITEM5_P2_S0	Holders As of January 31, 2018, there were 116 holders of record of our common stock.
1054721_18_ITEM5_P2_S1	Because many shares of our common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of shareholders, we are unable to determine the total number of shareholders represented by these holders of record.
1054721_18_ITEM5_P2_S2	Dividends We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock.
1054721_18_ITEM5_P2_S3	We currently intend to retain any future earnings to fund future development and growth and, therefore, do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1054721_18_ITEM5_P3_S0	Our line of credit agreement contains limitations on our ability to pay distributions or dividends while there is an ongoing event of default or to the extent such distribution causes an event of default.

1054721_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	Overview Since our inception, our business has largely been focused on providing software solutions (historically, including reselling software from Microsoft Corporation ( Microsoft )) and related engineering services to businesses that develop, market and sell dedicated-purpose standalone intelligent systems.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P2_S1	Examples of dedicated-purpose standalone intelligent systems include smart, connected computing devices such as smart phones, set-top boxes, point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, tablets and handheld data collection devices, as well as smart vending machines, ATM machines, digital signs and in-vehicle telematics and entertainment devices.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	We focus on systems that utilize various Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems as well as devices running other popular operating systems such as Android, Linux, and QNX, and that are usually connected to a network via a wired or wireless connection.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	Our customers include world-class original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ), original design manufacturers ( ODMs ), corporate enterprises ( Enterprises ), silicon vendors ( SVs ) and peripheral vendors.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P3_S2	A significant portion of our business historically has also been focused on reselling software from Microsoft, from which a majority of our revenue currently continues to be derived.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	Beginning in early 2014, we initiated development efforts focused on new proprietary software products addressing the Industrial Internet of Things ( IIoT ) market, by interconnecting of uniquely identifiable devices, extracting data from those devices and applying advanced analytics and machine learning to the data in order to derive meaningful and actionable insights.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P4_S1	While IIoT is a relatively new market, we believe the work we have engaged in since our inception namely adding intelligence and connectivity to discrete standalone devices and systems embodies much of what is central to the core functionality of IIoT.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P4_S2	These software development efforts have driven a new business initiative for BSQUARE, which we refer to as DataV .
1054721_18_ITEM7_P4_S3	Our DataV solution includes software products, applications and services that are designed to turn raw IIoT device data into meaningful and actionable data for our customers.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P4_S4	We launched DataV late in the first quarter of 2016 and announced our first three major customer bookings later that year.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P4_S5	These bookings comprised software licensing, software maintenance and related systems integration services and are, we believe, indicative of the potential customer demand for DataV.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P4_S6	During 2017 we began selling data analytics services and DataV application pilots to major industrial customers primarily in the transportation, oil and gas and manufacturing vertical markets and signed four pilots in the first six months of 2017 and another fifteen pilots in the second half of 2017, the majority of which are still ongoing.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	We believe that DataV presents high growth opportunities in a large, expanding addressable market, at substantially higher gross margins as compared to our traditional business.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	Developing, selling and implementing DataV has become our primary focus, as approximately 65% of our non-administrative employees are now working solely on DataV, representing a transition away from dependence on resale software and professional engineering services toward increased reliance on our own proprietary software and related systems integration services.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P5_S2	We intend to continue to run our legacy software resale business to maximize cash flow for the foreseeable future.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P5_S3	Our legacy professional engineering services business is now managed as a part of our overall services business, which increasingly serves DataV customers and prospects.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	Critical Accounting Judgments Revenue recognition We recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	We generate all of our revenue from contracts with customers.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P6_S2	Third-party software We sell third-party software licenses based upon a customer purchase order, shipping a certificate of authenticity ( COA ) to satisfy this single performance obligation.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P6_S3	These shipments are also subject to limited return rights; historically, returns have averaged less than one-quarter of one percent.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	We recognize revenue from third-party products at the time of shipment when the customer accepts control of the COA.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	Proprietary software We sell our proprietary software products to customers under a contract or by purchase order.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	Our DataV software contracts generally include professional services, a perpetual or term license and support and maintenance.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	In contracts with multiple performance obligations, we identify each performance obligation and evaluate whether the performance obligations are distinct within the context of the contract at contract inception.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	Performance obligations that are not distinct at contract inception are combined.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P9_S2	Contracts that include software customization may result in the combination of the customization services with the software license as one distinct performance obligation.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	The transaction price is generally in the form of a fixed fee at contract inception.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	Certain DataV contracts also include variable consideration in the form of royalties earned when customers meet contractual volume thresholds.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	We allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation based on the estimated standalone selling price for each performance obligation.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	We then look to how control transfers to the customer in order to determine the timing of revenue recognition.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	In contracts that include customer acceptance, we recognize revenue when we have delivered the software and received customer acceptance.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	We recognize revenue from support and maintenance performance obligations over the service delivery period.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P12_S2	We recognize revenue from royalties in the period of usage.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P12_S3	Our non-DataV software products generally do not include customization or modification services and are sold in the form of term licenses.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P12_S4	These software licenses represent only one distinct performance obligation.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	Revenue is recognized when the software is delivered to the customer.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	There are two items involving revenue recognition on DataV software contracts that require us to make more difficult and subjective judgments: the determination of which performance obligations are distinct within the context of the overall contract and the estimated standalone selling price of each performance obligation.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P13_S2	In instances where our DataV contracts include significant customization or modification services, the customization and modification services are generally combined with the software license and recorded as one distinct performance obligation.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	We estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation based on either a cost-plus-margin approach or an adjusted market assessment approach.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	In instances where we have observable selling prices for professional services and support and maintenance, we may apply the residual approach to estimate the standalone selling price of software licenses.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	Professional engineering services We enter into contracts for professional engineering services that include software development and customization.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	We identify each performance obligation in our professional engineering services contracts at contract inception.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P15_S2	The contracts generally include project deliverables specified by each customer.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P15_S3	The performance obligations in the contracts are generally combined into one deliverable.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P15_S4	The contract pricing is either at stated billing rates per service hour and material costs or at a fixed amount.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	Services provided under professional engineering contracts generally result in the transfer of control of the applicable deliverable over time.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	We recognize revenue on service contracts based on time and materials as we have the right to invoice.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P16_S2	We recognize revenue on fixed fee contracts on the proportion of labor hours expended to the total hours expected to complete the contract performance obligation.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P16_S3	Certain professional engineering contracts include substantive customer acceptance provisions, in which case, we recognize revenue upon customer acceptance.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	The determination of the total labor hours expected to complete the performance obligations on fixed fee contracts involves significant judgment.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P17_S1	We incorporate revisions to hour and cost estimates when the causal facts become known.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P17_S2	In certain situations, when it is impractical for us to reasonably measure the outcome of a performance obligation, and where we anticipate that we will not incur a loss, an adjusted cost-based input method is used for revenue recognition.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P17_S3	Equal amounts of revenue and cost are recognized during the contract period, and profit is recognized when the project is completed and accepted.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	We measure our estimate of completion on fixed-price contracts, which in turn determines the amount of revenue we recognize, based primarily on actual hours incurred to date and our estimate of remaining hours necessary to complete the contract.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	These estimates factor in such variables as the remaining tasks, the complexity of the tasks, the contracted quality of the software to be provided, the customer s estimated delivery date, integration of third-party software and quality thereof and other factors.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	Every fixed-price contract requires various approvals within our company, including our Chief Executive Officer if significant.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	This approval process takes into consideration several factors, including the complexity of engineering required.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	Historically, our estimation processes related to fixed-price contracts have been accurate based on the information known at the time of the reporting of our results.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	However, percentage-of-completion estimates require significant judgment.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	As of December 31, 2017, we were delivering professional engineering services under three fixed-price service contracts.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	The estimated remaining labor hours and costs to complete these contracts represent management s best estimates based on the facts and circumstances as of the filing of this report.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P21_S2	If there are changes to the underlying facts and circumstances, we record the revisions to our calculations in the period the changes are noted.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P21_S3	For illustrative purposes only, if we were 10% under in our estimate of remaining labor hours and costs on the fixed-bid contracts active on December 31, 2017, our revenue could have been overstated by approximately $36,000 for 2017.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	Intangible assets and goodwill We evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	Our intangible assets consist of customer relationships arising from business acquisitions.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P22_S2	We periodically assess the value of our intangible assets.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P22_S3	Factors that could trigger an impairment analysis include significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	If this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired, we assess the likelihood of recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P23_S1	If this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining useful life, we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	If we determine that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely greater than its carrying amount, we do not conduct further impairment testing.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	If we determine that the fair value of the reporting unit is not more likely greater than the carrying amount, we perform a quantitative two-step impairment test.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P25_S2	If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, we then perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of any impairment loss.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P25_S3	Any such impairment charges could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	Stock-based compensation Our stock-based compensation expense for stock options is estimated at the grant date based on the stock award s fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton ( BSM ) option-pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	The BSM model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and option life.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P26_S2	If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	Restricted stock units ( RSUs ) are measured based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant as determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P27_S2	We recognize share-based award forfeitures as they occur rather than at vest date.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	Incentive compensation We make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions regarding the likelihood of attainment, and the level thereof, of bonuses payable under our annual incentive compensation programs.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	We accrue bonuses and recognize the resulting expense when the bonus is judged reasonably likely to be earned as of year-end and is estimable.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P28_S2	The amount accrued, and expense recognized, is the estimated portion of the bonus earned on a year-to-date basis less any amounts previously accrued.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P28_S3	These estimates, judgments and assumptions are made quarterly based on available information and take into consideration our year-to-date actual results and expected results for the remainder of the year.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P28_S4	Because we consider estimated future results in assessing the likelihood of attainment, significant judgment is required.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P28_S5	If actual results differ materially from our estimates, the amount of bonus expense recorded in a particular quarter could be significantly over- or under-estimated.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the countries and other jurisdictions in which we operate.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	This process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P29_S2	These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P29_S3	Net operating losses and tax credits, to the extent not already utilized to offset taxable income or income taxes, also give rise to deferred tax assets.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P29_S4	We must then assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income, and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	We are required to use judgment as to the appropriate weighting of all available evidence when assessing the need for the establishment or the release of valuation allowances.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P30_S1	As part of this analysis, we examine all available evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis and weigh the positive and negative information when determining the need for full or partial valuation allowances.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P30_S2	The evidence considered for each jurisdiction includes, among other items, (i) the historical levels of income or loss over a range of time periods that extends beyond the two years presented, (ii) the historical sources of income and losses, (iii) the expectations and risk associated with underlying estimates of future taxable income, (iv) the expectations and risk associated with new product offerings and uncertainties with the timing of future taxable income, and (v) prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P31_S1	We estimate the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P31_S2	Our sales may be subject to other taxes, particularly withholding taxes, due to our sales to customers in countries other than the United States.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P31_S3	The tax regulations governing withholding taxes are complex, causing us to have to make assumptions about the appropriate tax treatment.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P31_S4	Further, we make sales in many jurisdictions across the United States, where tax regulations are varied and complex.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P31_S5	We must therefore continue to analyze our state tax exposure and determine what the appropriate tax treatments are, and make estimates for sales, franchise, income and other state taxes.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P31_S6	The following table presents our summarized results of operations for the periods indicated.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P31_S7	Our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	Revenue We generate revenue from the sale of software, both our own proprietary software and third-party software that we resell, and the sale of professional engineering services.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	Total revenue decreased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to lower sales of Microsoft Windows Embedded and Mobile operating systems and lower professional engineering service revenue, predominantly in North America.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P32_S2	This decrease was partially offset by recognition of approximately $3.8 million in DataV revenue in 2017.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P32_S3	One customer, Honeywell International Inc., accounted for 15% and 14% of total revenue in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P32_S4	No other customers accounted for 10% or more of total revenue in those periods.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P32_S5	Additional revenue details were as follows:
1054721_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	Revenue Total revenue consists of sales of third-party software and revenue realized from sales of our own proprietary software products, which include software license sales and support and maintenance revenue, and professional engineering services that support proprietary DataV software customers and legacy service customers.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	Third-party software revenue decreased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to lower sales of Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems, a portion of which is attributable to higher levels of buying activity late in 2016 as customers anticipated higher pricing following the cessation of Microsoft s volume purchase discount programs on December 31, 2016.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P33_S2	Sales of Microsoft operating systems represented approximately 80% and 81% of our total revenue and 54% and 74% of our total gross profit for 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P33_S3	Proprietary software revenue increased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to approximately $3.0 million in DataV software revenue recognized in 2017, the vast majority of which was recognized in the first quarter of 2017 when we delivered and received customer acceptance on a DataV software license.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P33_S4	We expect that revenue from both DataV and our other proprietary software will continue to fluctuate in timing and amount in future periods.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P33_S5	We anticipate that our DataV revenue will grow over time, but that other proprietary software product sales will decline over time as they approach the end of their respective life cycles.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	Professional engineering service revenue decreased in 2017 compared to 2016, due to declines in service revenue generated in North America, Asia and Europe with the completion in 2016 and early 2017 of several existing customer projects and a shift in our sales generation priorities and staffing to DataV. Our largest professional engineering customers in 2017 were Coca-Cola and Google.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P34_S1	We expect that professional engineering service revenue will grow over time as we continue our strategic focus on DataV; we will continue to serve our legacy services customers as long as our contracts are profitable and such revenue will continue to vary in timing and amounts.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P34_S2	As we started to conclude those existing customer projects in 2016 and began to align our organizational structure with our increasing focus on DataV, our board of directors approved a restructuring plan in July 2016 that included a workforce reduction in our professional engineering service group.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P34_S3	We incurred pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $1.0 million in 2016, the vast majority of which was included in cost of service revenue.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P34_S4	The staff reductions from this restructuring were completed in the fourth quarter of 2016.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P34_S5	See also Professional engineering service gross profit and gross margin discussion below.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	Gross profit and gross margin Cost of software revenue consists primarily of the cost of third-party software products payable to third-party vendors and support costs associated with our proprietary software products.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P35_S1	Cost of service revenue consists primarily of salaries and benefits, contractor costs and re-billable expenses, related facilities and depreciation costs, and amortization of certain intangible assets related to acquisitions.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P35_S2	Gross profit and gross margin were as follows:
1054721_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	Gross profit and gross margin Third-party software gross profit declined in 2017 compared to 2016, with lower levels of third-party software sales, but gross margins increased.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	We experienced increased competition in a number of larger third-party software accounts during 2017 as price protections under Microsoft volume pricing agreements came to an end in 2016; revenues lost in these accounts were more heavily weighted to lower margin customers, enabling slightly improved gross margins in 2017.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P36_S2	Gross profit on third-party software was positively impacted by rebate credits we receive from Microsoft for the sale of Windows Embedded operating systems earned through the achievement of defined objectives.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P36_S3	Under the Microsoft rebate program, we recorded $499,000 and $345,000 of rebates in 2017 and 2016, respectively, which were accounted for as reductions in cost of revenue.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	million and $1.1 million in rebates in 2017 and 2016, respectively, which were accounted for as reductions in marketing expenses.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P37_S1	There was a balance of approximately $411,000 in outstanding rebates for which we qualified as of December 31, 2017.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P37_S2	If qualified program expenditures are made, these will be accounted for as reductions in marketing expense in the period in which such expenditures a re made.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	Proprietary software gross profit and gross margin increased in 2017 compared to 2016, due primarily to the recognition of approximately $3.0 million in DataV software revenue recognized in 2017, the vast majority of which was recognized in the first quarter of 2017 when we delivered and received customer acceptance on a DataV software license sold to PACCAR.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	We anticipate that software gross profit and gross margin will continue to fluctuate in future periods due to the timing of DataV software revenue recognition.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P38_S2	Professional engineering service gross profit and gross margin increased in 2017 compared to 2016, resulting from higher utilization of professional engineering personnel in 2017.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P38_S3	In addition, we incurred approximately $1.0 million in restructuring costs in 2016.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P38_S4	This restructuring was completed in the fourth quarter of 2016.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P38_S5	Operating expenses Operating expenses were as follows:
1054721_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, commissions and bonuses for our sales, marketing and administrative personnel and related facilities and depreciation costs, as well as professional services fees (e.g., consulting, legal, audit and tax).
1054721_18_ITEM7_P39_S1	A expenses increased in 2017 compared to 2016, due to higher spending for the hiring of sales and customer support personnel and new marketing programs to support the scaling and launch of our DataV products, and other increased general and administrative spending.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P39_S2	Research and development Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for software development and quality assurance personnel, contractor and consultant costs and related facilities and depreciation costs.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P39_S3	R D expenses increased in 2017 compared to 2016, due to higher spending for continued development of our DataV product line.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	Other income and loss Other income and loss consists primarily of interest income on our cash and investments, gains and losses we may recognize on our investments, gains and losses on foreign exchange transactions and other items.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	The decrease in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to business tax refunds in 2016 and foreign exchange rate fluctuations, partially offset by higher interest income resulting from higher prevailing interest rates.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	Income taxes Income tax benefit for 2017 related to discrete items (including U.K. stock compensation tax benefits, a U.K. net operating loss carryback, an international tax reserve release and a refund of U.S. alternative minimum tax as a result of an amended return), partially offset by Japan tax expense.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	Income tax expense for 2016 related to U.S. alternative minimum tax, U.K. tax expense and a discrete increase in the Japan valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2017, we had $24.8 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments, compared to $33.2 million at December 31, 2016, reflecting a net use of approximately $8.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	We generally invest our excess cash in high quality marketable investments.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P43_S2	These investments generally include corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money market funds, although specific holdings can vary from period to period depending upon our cash requirements.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P43_S3	Our investments held at December 31, 2017 had minimal default risk and short-term maturities.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	Operating activities used cash of approximately $8.2 million in 2017, which included a net loss of $9.1 million, non-cash adjustments of $2.4 million, and a working capital usage of approximately $1.5 mil lion.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P44_S1	Operating activities provided cash of approximately $2.6 million in 2016 , which included net loss of approximately $1.1 million, non-cash adjustments of approximately $1.8 million, and a working capital contribution of approximately $1.8 million.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P44_S2	Investing activities provided cash of approximately $6.5 million in 2017, primarily due to net cash inflows on short-term investments of $7.0 million offset by capital expenditures of $0.4 million.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P44_S3	Investing activities used cash of approximately $5.8 million in 2016, primarily due to net cash outflows on short-term investments of $5.6 million and capital expenditures of $0.4 million.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P44_S4	Financing activities provided cash of approximately $0.2 million in 2017 and $1.1 million in 2016 resulting from the exercise of stock options.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P44_S5	We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.
1054721_18_ITEM7_P44_S6	Contractual commitments Operating lease commitments were as follows as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands):
1054721_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
1054721_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data .
1054721_18_ITEM8_P1_S0	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders BSQUARE Corporation Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BSQUARE Corporation (the Company ) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, shareholders equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ).
1054721_18_ITEM8_P1_S1	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the year s then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P2_S0	Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for revenue recognition in 2017 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P2_S1	Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P2_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P2_S3	( PCAOB ) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P2_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P2_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P2_S6	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P2_S7	As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P2_S8	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P2_S9	Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P2_S10	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P2_S11	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P2_S12	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P3_S0	We have served as the Company s auditor since 2006.

1054721_18_ITEM8_P8_S0	Description of business BSQUARE Corporation ( BSQUARE ) was incorporated in Washington State in July 1994.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P8_S1	Since our inception, our business has largely been focused on providing software solutions (historically, including reselling software from Microsoft Corporation ( Microsoft )) and related engineering services to businesses that develop, market and sell dedicated-purpose standalone intelligent systems.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P8_S2	Examples of dedicated-purpose standalone intelligent systems include smart, connected computing devices such as smart phones, set-top boxes, point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, tablets and handheld data collection devices, as well as smart vending machines, ATM machines, digital signs and in-vehicle telematics and entertainment devices.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P9_S0	Beginning in early 2014, we initiated development efforts focused on new proprietary software products addressing the Industrial Internet of Things ( IIoT ) market, by interconnecting of uniquely identifiable devices, extracting data from those devices and applying advanced analytics and machine learning to the data in order to derive meaningful and actionable insights.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P9_S1	While IIoT is a relatively new market, we believe the work we have engaged in since our inception namely adding intelligence and connectivity to discrete standalone devices and systems embodies much of what is central to the core functionality of IIoT.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P9_S2	These software development efforts have driven a new business initiative for BSQUARE, which we refer to as DataV .
1054721_18_ITEM8_P9_S3	Our DataV solution includes software products, applications and services that are designed to turn raw IIoT device data into meaningful and actionable data for our customers.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P10_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of BSQUARE and our wholly owned subsidiaries.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P10_S1	All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P11_S0	Recently adopted accounting standards In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) amended the existing accounting standards for stock-based compensation by issuing Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-09 Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU 2016-09 ).
1054721_18_ITEM8_P11_S1	The changes in the new standard eliminated the requirements that excess tax benefits be recognized in additional paid-in capital and tax deficiencies be recognized either in the income tax provision or in additional paid-in capital, in addition to changing the accounting for forfeitures and presentation changes for cash flows.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P11_S2	We adopted the amendments in the first quarter of 2017.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P12_S0	ASU 2016-09 requires that certain amendments be applied using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of 2017.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P13_S0	We made an entity-wide accounting policy election to recognize share-based award forfeitures as they occur rather than at vest date, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P13_S1	There was no change to retained earnings with respect to unrecognized excess tax benefits as this was not applicable to us.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P13_S2	We have elected to present any excess tax benefits for share-based payments in operating activities rather than in financing activities on the cash flow statement on a prospective transition method, and no prior periods have been adjusted.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P14_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, amending revenue recognition guidance and requiring more detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P14_S1	The amended guidance, herein referred to as Topic 606, is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P14_S2	We elected to early adopt Topic 606, effective January 1, 2017, using the modified retrospective transition method.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P14_S3	As a result of this adoption, we recognized a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings at the beginning of 2017.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P14_S4	The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the period presented.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P14_S5	See further discussion in Note 2 Revenue Recognition.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P15_S0	Use of estimates Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P15_S1	Examples include provisions for bad debts and income taxes, estimates of progress on professional engineering service arrangements, bonus accruals, fair value of intangible assets and property and equipment, fair values of stock-based awards and the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities, among other estimates.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P15_S2	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P16_S0	Income (loss) per share We compute basic per share amounts using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and exclude any dilutive effects of common stock equivalent shares, such as options and restricted stock units ( RSUs ).
1054721_18_ITEM8_P16_S1	We consider RSUs as outstanding and include them in the computation of basic income or loss per share only when vested.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P16_S2	We compute diluted per share amounts using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P16_S3	We exclude common stock equivalent shares from the computation if their effect is anti-dilutive.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P16_S4	Unvested but outstanding RSUs are included in the diluted per share calculation.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P17_S0	In a period where we are in a net loss position, the diluted loss per share is computed using the basic share count.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P17_S1	The following table presents a reconciliation of the number of shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted per share amounts (in thousands):
1054721_18_ITEM8_P18_S0	Common stock equivalent shares of approximately 1,227,000 and 691,000 were excluded from the computation of diluted per share amounts for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, because their effect was anti-dilutive.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P19_S0	Cash, cash equivalents and investments We invest our excess cash primarily in highly liquid debt instruments of U.S. government agencies and municipalities, debt instruments issued by foreign governments, corporate commercial paper, money market funds, and corporate debt securities.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P19_S1	We classify all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months as short-term investments.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P19_S2	Short-term investments consist entirely of marketable securities, which are all classified as available-for-sale securities and are recorded at their estimated fair value.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P19_S3	We determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P19_S4	We may or may not hold securities with stated maturities greater than 12 months until maturity.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P19_S5	As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify securities with maturities less than 12 months as short-term investments.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P19_S6	We carry these securities at fair value and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of shareholders equity, except for unrealized losses determined to be other than temporary, which are recorded in other expense.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P20_S0	Restricted cash We had a restricted cash equivalents balance for funds held at a financial institution as security for an outstanding letter of credit related to our corporate headquarters lease obligation.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P20_S1	The full balance of restricted cash equivalents was released in September 2016 when we entered into a new letter of credit agreement secured by our credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Financial instruments and concentrations of risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts receivable.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P21_S0	Allowance for doubtful accounts We record accounts receivable at the invoiced amount net of an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P21_S1	We review customers that have past due invoices to identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P21_S2	In determining the amount of the allowance, we make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P22_S0	Equipment, furniture and leasehold improvements We account for equipment, furniture and leasehold improvements at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P22_S1	We compute depreciation of equipment and furniture using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three years.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P23_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful lives, ranging from two to ten years.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P23_S1	We expense maintenance and repair costs as incurred.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P24_S0	When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, gains or losses are included in the consolidated statements of operations.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P25_S0	circumstances indicate that the value of long-lived assets may be impaired, we perform an evaluation of recoverability comparing the carrying value of the asset to projec ted undiscounted future cash flows.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P25_S1	Upon indication that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss as a charge against current operations based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and it s fair value.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P26_S0	Intangible assets Intangible assets were recorded in connection with business acquisitions and are stated at estimated fair value at the time of acquisition less accumulated amortization.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P27_S0	We amortize our acquired intangible assets using the straight-line method using lives ranging from one to ten years.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P28_S0	We review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P28_S1	We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P28_S2	If intangible assets are considered impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P29_S0	Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P29_S1	We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P29_S2	If we determine that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely greater than its carrying amount, we do not conduct further impairment testing.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P30_S0	If we determine that the fair value of the reporting unit is not more likely greater than the carrying amount, we perform a quantitative two-step impairment test.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P30_S1	The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P30_S2	If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, we then perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of any impairment loss.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P31_S0	Third-party software fees payable We record all fees payable and accrued liabilities related to the sale of third-party software, such as Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating systems, as third-party software fees payable.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P32_S0	Research and development Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P32_S1	Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs would be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P33_S0	Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P33_S1	Generally, this would be reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing and would occur shortly before the product is released.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P33_S2	Amortization of costs incurred after this point would be included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P33_S3	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had not recorded any such capitalized costs.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P34_S0	Advertising costs All costs of advertising, including cooperative marketing arrangements, are expensed as incurred.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P34_S1	Advertising expense was $388,000 and $45,000 in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P35_S0	Stock-based compensation The estimated fair value of stock-based awards is recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P35_S1	We estimate forfeitures of stock-based awards based on historical experience and expected future activity.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P35_S2	The fair value of RSUs is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P35_S3	The fair value of stock options are estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of each vesting tranche as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton ( BSM ) option-pricing model.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P35_S4	The BSM model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and option life.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P35_S5	If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P36_S0	Comprehensive loss Comprehensive loss refers to net loss and other revenue, expenses, gains and losses that, under generally accepted accounting principles, are recorded as an element of shareholders equity but are excluded from the calculation of net loss.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P37_S0	Income taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P37_S1	Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P38_S0	We compute income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred income taxes are provided for on the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P38_S1	Our deferred tax amounts are measured using currently enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P38_S2	We apply judgment as to the appropriate weighting of all available evidence when assessing the need for the establishment or the release of valuation allowances.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P38_S3	As part of this analysis, we examine all available evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis and weigh the positive and negative information when determining the need for full or partial valuation allowances.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P38_S4	The evidence considered for each jurisdiction includes, among other items, (i) the historical levels of income or loss over a range of time periods that extends beyond the two years presented, (ii) the historical sources of income and losses, (iii) the expectations and risk associated with underlying estimates of future taxable income, (iv) the expectations and risk associated with new product offerings and uncertainties with the timing of future taxable income, and (v) prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P39_S0	Based on the analysis conducted as of December 31, 2017, we determined that we would not release, in full or in part, the valuation allowance against our U.S. gross deferred tax assets.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P39_S1	We recognize tax benefits from an uncertain position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based on its technical merits.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P39_S2	The tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P39_S3	Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are classified in the consolidated financial statemen ts as income tax expense.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P40_S0	The functional currency of foreign subsidiaries is their local currency.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P40_S1	Accordingly, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P40_S2	Resulting translation adjustments are included in other comprehensive loss and accumulated other comprehensive loss, a separate component of shareholders equity.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P41_S0	The net gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are recorded in the period incurred and were not significant for any of the periods presented.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P42_S0	The following is a description of principal activities from which we generate revenue.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P43_S0	Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P44_S0	We generate all of our revenue from contracts with customers.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P44_S1	Third-party software We sell third-party software licenses based upon a customer purchase order, shipping a certificate of authenticity ( COA ) to satisfy this single performance obligation.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P44_S2	These shipments are also subject to limited return rights; historically, returns have averaged less than one-quarter of one percent.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P44_S3	In accordance with Topic 606, we will continue to recognize revenue from third-party products at the time of shipment when the customer accepts control of the COA.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P45_S0	Proprietary software We sell our proprietary software products to customers under a contract or by purchase order.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P45_S1	Our DataV software contracts generally include professional services, a perpetual or term license and support and maintenance.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P46_S0	In contracts with multiple performance obligations, we identify each performance obligation and evaluate whether the performance obligations are distinct within the context of the contract at contract inception.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P46_S1	Performance obligations that are not distinct at contract inception are combined.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P46_S2	Contracts that include software customization may result in the combination of the customization services with the software license as one distinct performance obligation.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P47_S0	The transaction price is generally in the form of a fixed fee at contract inception.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P47_S1	Certain DataV contracts also include variable consideration in the form of royalties earned when customers meet contractual volume thresholds.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P48_S0	We allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation based on the estimated standalone selling price for each performance obligation.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P48_S1	We then look to how control transfers to the customer in order to determine the timing of revenue recognition.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P49_S0	In contracts that include customer acceptance, we recognize revenue when we have delivered the software and received customer acceptance.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P49_S1	We recognize revenue from support and maintenance performance obligations over the service delivery period.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P49_S2	We recognize revenue from royalties in the period of usage.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P49_S3	Our non-DataV software products generally do not include customization or modification services and are sold in the form of term licenses.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P49_S4	These software licenses represent only one distinct performance obligation.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P50_S0	Revenue is recognized when the software is delivered to the customer.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P51_S0	There are two items involving revenue recognition on DataV software contracts that re quire us to make more difficult and subjective judgments: the determination of which performance obligations are distinct within the context of the overall contract and the estimated standalone selling price of each performance obligation.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P51_S1	In instances whe re our DataV contracts include significant customization or modification services, the customization and modification services are generally combined with the software license and recorded as one distinct performance obligation.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P52_S0	We estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation based on either a cost-plus-margin approach or an adjusted market assessment approach.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P52_S1	In instances where we have observable selling prices for professional services and support and maintenance, we may apply the residual approach to estimate the standalone selling price of software licenses.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P53_S0	Professional engineering services We enter into contracts for professional engineering services that include DataV software pilot services, software implementation and customization.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P53_S1	We have certain legacy contracts to deliver other engineering services to customers that we will continue to serve as long as they are profitable; some of our legacy services customers may become DataV customers.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P53_S2	To date, the majority of our DataV services contracts are fixed fee pilot programs.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P54_S0	We identify each performance obligation in our professional engineering services contracts at contract inception.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P54_S1	The contracts generally include project deliverables specified by each customer; for DataV services contracts, the goal of the contract is to assess customer data and demonstrate how DataV applications solve the customer s business use case, with success resulting in a DataV software license.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P54_S2	The performance obligations for both DataV and other service contracts are generally combined into one deliverable.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P54_S3	The contract pricing is either at stated billing rates per service hour and material costs or at a fixed amount.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P55_S0	Services provided under the majority of our legacy non-DataV professional engineering contracts generally result in the transfer of control of the applicable deliverable over time.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P55_S1	For most legacy service contracts, we recognize revenue on service contracts based on time and materials as we have the right to invoice.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P55_S2	We recognize revenue on fixed fee contracts on the proportion of labor hours expended (under ASC 606, the input method ) to the total hours expected to complete the contract performance obligation.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P55_S3	Certain professional engineering contracts include substantive customer acceptance provisions, in which case we recognize revenue upon customer acceptance.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P55_S4	For most DataV pilot service contracts we recognize revenue upon completion of the pilot.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P55_S5	For contracts that require the input method for revenue recognition, the determination of the total labor hours expected to complete the performance obligations on fixed fee contracts involves significant judgment.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P56_S0	We incorporate revisions to hour and cost estimates when the causal facts become known.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P56_S1	In certain situations, when it is impractical for us to reasonably measure the outcome of a performance obligation, and where we anticipate that we will not incur a loss, an adjusted cost-based input method is used for revenue recognition.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P56_S2	Equal amounts of revenue and cost are recognized during the contract period, and profit is recognized when the project is completed and accepted.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P56_S3	Recently issued accounting pronouncements In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, to make leasing activities more transparent and comparable, requiring most leases to be recognized by lessees on their balance sheets as right-of-use assets, along with corresponding lease liabilities.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P56_S4	ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 31, 2018 and interim periods within that year, with early adoption permitted.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P56_S5	We are currently evaluating the impact this ASU may have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P57_S0	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, simplifying how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating step two from the goodwill impairment test described above.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P57_S1	ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted on testing dates after January 1, 2017.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P57_S2	We are currently evaluating the impact this ASU may have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P58_S0	On January 1, 2017, we adopted Topic 606, applying the modified retrospective method to all contracts that were not completed as of that date.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P58_S1	Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2017 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period results are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the prior period.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P58_S2	We recorded an increase to opening equity of $404,000 as of January 1, 2017 due to the cumulative impact of adopting Topic 606.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P58_S3	The impact to revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was an increase of $1.9 million as a result of adopting Topic 606.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P58_S4	The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a significant impact on our third-party software or professional engineering service revenue; however, it did have a significant impact on our proprietary DataV software products and services revenue.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P58_S5	We executed our first two DataV contracts in the fourth quarter of 2016.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P58_S6	Our current DataV contracts include customization, software license and support and maintenance performance obligations.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P59_S0	DataV software contracts was recognized under a zero-profit model whereby revenue was recognized up to the amount of costs i ncurred.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P59_S1	The profit margin was deferred and recognized ratably over the service and maintenance period after delivery and acceptance of the software product.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P59_S2	Under Topic 606, revenue is recognized on our DataV contracts when the customization services esse ntial to provide the derived benefit of the software to the customer are completed and control of the product is transferred to the customer as evidenced by customer acceptance.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P59_S3	Disaggregation of revenue The following table provides information about disaggregated revenue by primary geographical market, major product line and timing of revenue recognition, and includes a reconciliation of the disaggregated revenue with reportable segments (in thousands):
1054721_18_ITEM8_P60_S0	The following table provides information about receivables, contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers (in thousands):
1054721_18_ITEM8_P61_S0	We receive payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P61_S1	Accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P62_S0	Contract assets include amounts related to our contractual right to consideration for completed performance objectives not yet invoiced and deferred contract acquisition costs, which are amortized along with the associated revenue.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P62_S1	Contract liabilities include payments received in advance of performance under the contract and are realized with the associated revenue recognized under the contract.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P62_S2	We had no asset impairment charges related to contract assets in the period.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P62_S3	Significant changes in contract assets and liabilities balances were as follows (in thousands):
1054721_18_ITEM8_P63_S0	Contract acquisition costs In connection with the adoption of Topic 606, we are required to capitalize certain contract acquisition costs consisting primarily of commissions paid when contracts are signed.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P63_S1	As of January 1, 2017, the date we adopted Topic 606, we capitalized $292,000 in contract acquisition costs related to contracts that were not completed.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P63_S2	For contracts that have a duration of less than one year, we follow a Topic 606 practical expedient and expense these costs when incurred.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P63_S3	For contracts with lives exceeding one year, as is more common with our DataV software bookings, we record these costs in proportion to each completed contract performance obligation.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P63_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2017, the amount of amortization was $168,000, and there was no impairment loss in relation to costs capitalized.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P63_S5	During the year ended December 31, 2017, an additional $87,000 in contract acquisition costs were capitalized.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P64_S0	Performance obligations We did not recognize any revenue from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P64_S1	The following table includes estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied at the end of the reporting period, in thousands.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P64_S2	The estimated revenue does not include contracts with original durations of one year or less, amounts of variable consideration attributable to royalties, or contract renewals that are unexercised as of December 31, 2017.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P65_S0	Practical expedients and exemptions We generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been less than one year.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P65_S1	We record these costs within selling, general and administrative expenses.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P65_S2	In accordance with Topic 606, the disclosure of the impact of adoption to our consolidated statements of operations was as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):
1054721_18_ITEM8_P66_S0	In accordance with Topic 606, the disclosure of the impact of adoption to our consolidated balance sheet was as follows (in thousands):
1054721_18_ITEM8_P67_S0	Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments consisted of the following (in thousands):
1054721_18_ITEM8_P68_S0	We measure our cash equivalents and short-term investments at fair value.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P69_S0	Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P69_S1	As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P69_S2	A three-tier fair value hierarchy is established as a basis for considering such assumptions and for inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:
1054721_18_ITEM8_P70_S0	Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P71_S0	Directly or indirectly observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs used in models or other valuation methodologies.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P72_S0	Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P72_S1	The inputs require significant management judgment or estimation.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P73_S0	We classify our cash equivalents and short-term investments within Level 1 or Level 2 because our cash equivalents and short-term investments are valued using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P73_S1	We review the pricing techniques and methodologies of the independent pricing service for Level 2 investments and believe that the policies adequately consider market activity, either based on specific transactions for the security valued or based on modeling of securities with similar credit quality, duration, yield and structure that were recently traded.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P74_S0	Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in thousands):
1054721_18_ITEM8_P75_S0	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, contractual maturities of our short-term investments were less than one year, and gross unrealized gains and losses on those investments were not material.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P76_S0	Equipment, furniture, and leasehold improvements consisted of the following (in thousands):
1054721_18_ITEM8_P77_S0	Depreciation and amortization expense related to these assets was $536,000 and $468,000 in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P78_S0	Goodwill was recorded in connection with the September 2011 acquisition of MPC Data, Ltd. (renamed BSQUARE EMEA, Ltd. in 2015), a United Kingdom based provider of software engineering services.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P79_S0	value of net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill and is included within the professional engineeri ng service reporting unit.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P79_S1	There were no changes in the carrying amount of goodwill in 2017 and 2016.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P80_S0	Intangible assets relate to customer relationships that we acquired from TestQuest, Inc. in November 2008 and from the acquisition of BSQUARE EMEA, Ltd. in September 2011 and were as follows (in thousands):
1054721_18_ITEM8_P81_S0	Amortization expense was $98,000 and $130,000 for 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P81_S1	Amortization expense in future periods is expected to be as follows (in thousands):
1054721_18_ITEM8_P82_S0	Other income and loss consisted of the following (in thousands):
1054721_18_ITEM8_P83_S0	Pre-tax loss consisted of the following (in thousands):
1054721_18_ITEM8_P84_S0	Income tax benefit (expense) consisted of the following (in thousands):
1054721_18_ITEM8_P85_S0	Net deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following (in thousands):
1054721_18_ITEM8_P86_S0	Net deferred tax assets and liabilities were recorded as follows (in thousands):
1054721_18_ITEM8_P87_S0	The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted on December 22, 2017 (the Tax Act ) and introduces significant changes to U.S. income tax law.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P87_S1	Our accounting for the elements of the Tax Act that were effective for 2017 is complete and its impact is reflected in our 2017 consolidated financial statements.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P88_S0	The Tax Act reduces the US federal corporate tax rate from 35% in 2017 to 21% beginning in 2018.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P88_S1	The anticipated impact of the Tax Act for us is an $8.9 million reduction in our net deferred tax assets to reflect the new statutory rate.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P88_S2	The rate adjustment to the deferred tax assets, a discrete item for the quarter, was fully offset by a decrease in the valuation allowance so there is no rate impact to us.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P89_S0	Effective in 2018, companies may be subject to global intangible low tax income ( GILTI ) which is a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P89_S1	GILTI will be effectively taxed at a tax rate of 10.5%.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P89_S2	Due to the complexity of the GILTI tax rules, companies are allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either (1) treating taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred or (2) factoring such amounts into a company s measurement of its deferred taxes.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P89_S3	We are electing to treat taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred, and therefore there was no impact to our deferred tax rate in 2017.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P89_S4	As of December 31, 2017, our deferred tax assets were primarily the result of U.S. net operating loss, research and development credit carryforwards and stock-based compensation expense.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P89_S5	We have applied a full valuation allowance against the U.S. deferred tax assets in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P89_S6	We use judgment as to the appropriate weighting of all available evidence when assessing the need for the establishment or the release of valuation allowances.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P89_S7	As part of this analysis, we examine all available evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis and weigh the positive and negative information when determining the need for full or partial valuation allowances.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P89_S8	The evidence considered for each jurisdiction includes, among other items, (i) the historical levels of income or loss over a range of time periods that extends beyond the two years presented, (ii) the historical sources of income and losses, (iii) the expectations and risk associated with underlying estimates of future taxable income, (iv) the expectations and risk associated with new product offerings and uncertainties with the timing of future taxable income, and (v) prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P90_S0	Based on the analysis conducted as of December 31, 2017, we determined that we would not release, in full or in part, the valuation allowance against our U.S. gross deferred tax assets.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P91_S0	The provision for income taxes differed from the amount of expected income tax expense determined by applying the applicable U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to pre-tax loss as follows (in thousands, except percentages):
1054721_18_ITEM8_P92_S0	At December 31, 2017, we had approximately $61.6 million of federal and $4.4 million of state net operating loss carryforwards, which have begun to expire, including approximately $1.2 million of state losses which will expire in 2026.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P92_S1	Of the federal net operating loss carryforwards, approximately $36.3 million will expire in 2022 and 2023.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P92_S2	We also have approximately $3.0 million of tax credit carryforwards, which begin to expire in 2018.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P92_S3	Use of these carryforwards may subject us to an annual limitation due to Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code that restricts the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use its carryforwards.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P93_S0	Under the applicable tax rules, an ownership change occurs if holders of more than five percent of an issuer s outstanding common stock, collectively, increase their ownership percentage by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P93_S1	We have performed analyses of possible ownership changes in the past, which included consideration of third-party studies, and do not believe that an ownership change of more than 50 percentage points has occurred.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P93_S2	We have evaluated all the material income tax positions taken on our income tax filings to various tax authorities, and we determined that we did not have unrealized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions recorded at December 31, 2017 or 2016.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P93_S3	Because of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, substantially all of our tax years remain open and subject to examination.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P94_S0	Contractual commitments Our commitments include obligations under operating leases, which expire through 2020.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P94_S1	We have lease commitments for office space in Bellevue, Washington; Taipei, Taiwan; Trowbridge, UK; and Tokyo, Japan.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P94_S2	We also lease office space on a month-to-month basis in Akron, Ohio, and on an annual basis in Boston, Massachusetts.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P94_S3	Rent expense was approximately $1.0 million in each of 2017 and 2016.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P94_S4	We had $250,000 pledged as collateral for a bank letter of credit under the terms of our headquarters facility lease.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P94_S5	The pledged cash supporting the outstanding letter of credit was recorded as restricted cash equivalents.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P94_S6	In September 2016, this letter of credit agreement was replaced by a letter of credit secured by our credit agreement and the corresponding restricted cash equivalents were returned to us.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P95_S0	Operating lease commitments are as follows (in thousands):
1054721_18_ITEM8_P96_S0	Loss contingencies From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business including tax assessments.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P96_S1	We defend ourselves vigorously against any such claims.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P97_S0	When (i) it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and (ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record the estimated loss.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P97_S1	We provide disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for loss contingencies that do not meet both of these conditions if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred that would be material to the financial statements.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P97_S2	Significant judgment is required to determine the probability that a liability has been incurred and whether such liability is reasonably estimable.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P98_S0	We base accruals made on the best information available at the time, which can be highly subjective.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P98_S1	The final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P99_S0	Equity compensation plans We have a stock plan (the Stock Plan ) and an inducement stock plan for newly hired employees (the Inducement Plan ) (collectively the Plans ).
1054721_18_ITEM8_P99_S1	Under the Plans, stock options may be granted with a fixed exercise price that is equivalent to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P99_S2	These options have a term of up to 10 years and vest over a predetermined period, generally four years.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P99_S3	Incentive stock options granted under the Stock Plan may only be granted to our employees.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P99_S4	The Plans also allow for awards of non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted and unrestricted stock awards, and RSUs.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P100_S0	Stock-based compensation The estimated fair value of stock-based awards is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the award, net of estimated forfeitures.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P101_S0	We estimate forfeitures based on historical experience and expected future activity.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P102_S0	The fair value of RSUs is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P102_S1	The fair value of stock options is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of each vesting tranche as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton ( BSM ) option-pricing model.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P102_S2	The BSM model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and option life.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P102_S3	If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P103_S0	The fair values of our stock option grants were estimated with the following weighted average assumptions:
1054721_18_ITEM8_P104_S0	The impact on our results of operations from stock-based compensation expense was as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):
1054721_18_ITEM8_P105_S0	Stock option activity The following table summarizes stock option activity:
1054721_18_ITEM8_P106_S0	At December 31, 2017, total compensation cost related to stock options granted but not yet recognized was approximately $1,016,877, net of estimated forfeitures.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P106_S1	This cost will be amortized on the straight-line method over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.50 years.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P107_S0	The following table summarizes certain additional information about stock options:
1054721_18_ITEM8_P108_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the quoted price of our common stock for the number of options that were exercised during the periods indicated.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P109_S0	We issue new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P109_S1	Restricted stock unit activity The following table summarizes RSU activity :
1054721_18_ITEM8_P110_S0	At December 31, 2017, total compensation cost related to RSUs granted but not recognized was approximately $237,386 , net of estimated forfeitures.
1054721_18_ITEM8_P110_S1	This cost will be amortized on the straight-line method over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.12 years.
